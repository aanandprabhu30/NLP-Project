Leveraging blockchain for sustainable supply chain management: A data privacy and security perspective,"This review examines how blockchain technology can be leveraged to enhance data privacy and security in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). As global supply chains become increasingly complex and the demand for sustainability grows, ensuring data privacy and security has become a critical concern. Traditional supply chain systems often face challenges such as data breaches, lack of transparency, and difficulty in tracing products and materials. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized, immutable, and transparent architecture, offers a promising solution to these challenges. Blockchain can enhance data security by ensuring that data is tamper-proof, traceable, and encrypted, thus protecting sensitive information across the supply chain. It provides transparency while allowing permissioned access, ensuring that stakeholders can verify data without exposing confidential information. Furthermore, privacy-preserving technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption allow verification of data without compromising its security. Smart contracts enable automated compliance with regulatory frameworks like GDPR, reducing the risk of human error and improving operational efficiency. The integration of blockchain in SSCM can improve traceability, transparency, and accountability, thereby promoting environmental and social sustainability. By tracking the origin and journey of goods, blockchain helps verify ethical sourcing practices and reduce carbon footprints. However, the technology also presents challenges, including scalability, integration with legacy systems, and cost considerations.

Analysis and Improvement of Blockchain-Based Multilevel Privacy-Preserving Location Sharing Scheme for Telecare Medical Information Systems,"Patient location sharing is an important part of modern smart healthcare and mobile medical services. Blockchain has many attractive properties and is suitable for managing patient locations in telecare medical information systems (TMIS). Recently, Ji et al. proposed a blockchain-based multilevel privacy-preserving location sharing (BMPLS) scheme for TMIS.

Intelligent transportation systems trusted user’s security and privacy,"Standard encryption cannot be utilized in practical communications due to time and storage limits. Dedicated lane keeping (DRL) is a technique that helps self-driving cars navigate congested roads by keeping them in a specific lane (CAVs). Researchers have developed separate networks for distinct types of mixed traffic to cut down on the time and effort typically spent on instruction and coordination. A deep reinforcement learning technique boosts the efficiency of each part and the entire fleet. There is a common misconception that the blockchain is a secure database for private information. A distributed database system in which nodes are directly connected to consensus mechanisms. To ensure data integrity, block blocks on a blockchain network use cryptography and other computer safeguards (such as smart contracts and time stamps). Because of its decentralized design, data storage facilitates collaboration. Digitally signed data records can also be checked to ensure they are accurate. Using hashes to connect individual blocks protects data against tampering by hackers. There is no need for a centralized authority or third party to verify the ledger’s accuracy because everyone can access it anytime. The blockchain allows for a transparent, trustworthy, and auditable system sharing information between entities. Like many other industries, transportation may benefit from the broader implementation of blockchain technology. Based on our findings, a state-run blockchain tailored to the transportation industry was developed and made available to the public.

Privacy Preservation in Patient Information Exchange Systems Based on Blockchain: System Design Study,"Background With the increasing sophistication of the medical industry, various advanced medical services such as medical artificial intelligence, telemedicine, and personalized health care services have emerged. The demand for medical data is also rapidly increasing today because advanced medical services use medical data such as user data and electronic medical records (EMRs) to provide services. As a result, health care institutions and medical practitioners are researching various mechanisms and tools to feed medical data into their systems seamlessly. However, medical data contain sensitive personal information of patients. Therefore, ensuring security while meeting the demand for medical data is a very important problem in the information age for which a solution is required. Objective Our goal is to design a blockchain-based decentralized patient information exchange (PIE) system that can safely and efficiently share EMRs. The proposed system preserves patients’ privacy in the EMRs through a medical information exchange process that includes data encryption and access control. Methods We propose a blockchain-based EMR-sharing system that allows patients to manage their EMRs scattered across multiple hospitals and share them with other users. Our PIE system protects the patient’s EMR from security threats such as counterfeiting and privacy attacks during data sharing. In addition, it provides scalability by using distributed data-sharing methods to quickly share an EMR, regardless of its size or type. We implemented simulation models using Hyperledger Fabric, an open source blockchain framework. Results We performed a simulation of the EMR-sharing process and compared it with previous works on blockchain-based medical systems to check the proposed system’s performance. During the simulation, we found that it takes an average of 0.01014 (SD 0.0028) seconds to download 1 MB of EMR in our proposed PIE system. Moreover, it has been confirmed that data can be freely shared with other users regardless of the size or format of the data to be transmitted through the distributed data-sharing technique using the InterPlanetary File System. We conducted a security analysis to check whether the proposed security mechanism can effectively protect users of the EMR-sharing system from security threats such as data forgery or unauthorized access, and we found that the distributed ledger structure and re-encryption–based data encryption method can effectively protect users’ EMRs from forgery and privacy leak threats and provide data integrity. Conclusions Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that provides data integrity to enable patient-centered health information exchange and access control. PIE systems integrate and manage fragmented patient EMRs through blockchain and protect users from security threats during the data exchange process among users. To increase safety and efficiency in the EMR-sharing process, we used access control using security levels, data encryption based on re-encryption, and a distributed data-sharing scheme.",BSP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d19a4bf71b9b61a54dedacba5ab97e4e750d763,True
Consortium Blockchain for Security and Privacy-Preserving in E-government Systems,"Since its inception as a solution for secure cryptocurrencies sharing in 2008, the blockchain technology has now become one of the core technologies for secure data sharing and storage over trustless and decentralised peer-to-peer systems.

Over the past decade, information and communication technology has proved its ability to improve medical quality, reduce costs, and promote data security. Developing countries can exploit these technologies to improve the healthcare process and ensure remote health monitoring, especially in rural areas. The Internet of Things and smart medical devices are widely used to provide remote patient monitoring. Current systems are based on centralized communication with cloud servers. However, this architecture increases several security and privacy risks. The adoption of a distributed architecture is required to overcome these issues. In this article, we describe a Blockchain-based system for securing Internet-of-Things (IoT) healthcare devices. In addition to data encryption, we propose to use Blockchain technology to enhance security and privacy in healthcare systems. The system is intended to allow remote patient monitoring, particularly for chronic diseases that necessitate regular monitoring. Three important characteristics were taken into account: security, scalability, and processing time. The security concerns are ensured by using the re-encryption proxy in conjunction with Blockchain to encrypt data and control access to it. To ensure Blockchain scalability, data are stored in an InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) off-chain database. We use an Ethereum Blockchain based on proof of authority (PoA) to speed up the data storage.

Secure and Privacy-Preserving Energy Trading With Demand Response Assistance Based on Blockchain,"The large-scale integration of decentralized energy resources has resulted in surgical changes in energy trading systems. Traditional centralized trading systems suffer from high management costs and low efficiency. The recent advance in blockchain technology has enabled the invention of decentralized energy trading systems, which can overcome the limitations of centralized trading systems. However, security and privacy concerns have become obstacles when widely marketing and implementing decentralized energy trading systems. For example, the on-chain transactions are publicly visible, leading to the risk of trading information leakages. Moreover, in the demand response (DR) assistance process, the aggregated report of energy trading results may contain detailed trading information which results in user privacy leakage. To address those problems, this article proposes a blockchain-based privacy-aware energy trading mechanism. We design a stealthy on-chain transmission method to protect user privacy without revealing the consumer-supplier trading relationship and the exact trading data. Furthermore, we employ non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proof to aggregate reports in a reliable and privacy-preserving manner. Security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can achieve security goals with affordable cost for decentralized energy trading systems.",BSP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9117a7ee6e532ca8435e135d77a4539a7474f8ec,True
Integration of Blockchain technology in biomedical diagnostics: Ensuring data security and privacy in infectious disease surveillance,"The integration of blockchain technology in biomedical diagnostics offers a promising solution to the challenges of data security and privacy in infectious disease surveillance. As the digitalization of healthcare systems accelerates, the need to protect sensitive health information becomes increasingly critical. Blockchain, with its decentralized and immutable nature, provides a robust framework for ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of biomedical data. This abstract explores how blockchain technology can be leveraged to enhance data security and privacy in the context of infectious disease surveillance, where rapid and accurate data sharing is essential for effective public health responses. Infectious disease surveillance relies on the collection, analysis, and dissemination of large volumes of data, often shared across multiple institutions and geographical regions. Traditional systems for managing this data are vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, and data tampering, which can compromise public health efforts and patient privacy. Blockchain technology addresses these vulnerabilities by enabling secure, transparent, and tamper-proof data exchanges. Each transaction or data entry is recorded in a distributed ledger, accessible only to authorized participants, thus ensuring that the data remains secure and unaltered. Moreover, blockchain’s inherent transparency allows for real-time monitoring and auditing of data flows, which is crucial in the timely detection and response to infectious disease outbreaks. The use of smart contracts within blockchain networks further enhances the automation and efficiency of data management, ensuring that data is only accessed and shared according to predefined rules and conditions. This not only safeguards patient privacy but also builds trust among stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and public health authorities. In conclusion, the integration of blockchain technology in biomedical diagnostics presents a transformative approach to addressing the critical issues of data security and privacy in infectious disease surveillance. By leveraging blockchain's unique features, healthcare systems can ensure that sensitive diagnostic data is protected, thus supporting more effective and secure public health interventions in the fight against infectious diseases.

A Stealthy Communication Model with Blockchain Smart Contract for Bidding Systems,"With the widespread adoption of blockchain technology, its public ledger characteristic enhances transaction transparency but also amplifies the risk of privacy breaches. Attackers can infer users’ real identities and behaviors by analyzing public transaction patterns and address relationships, posing a severe threat to users’ privacy and security, and thus hindering further advancements in blockchain applications. To address this challenge, covert communication has emerged as an effective strategy for safeguarding the privacy of blockchain users and preventing information leakage. But existing blockchain-based covert communication schemes rely solely on the immutability of blockchain itself for robustness and suffer from low transmission efficiency. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a stealthy communication model with blockchain smart contract for bidding systems. The model initiates by preprocessing sensitive information using a secret-sharing algorithm-the Shamir (t, n) threshold scheme-and subsequently embeds this information into bidding amounts, facilitating the covert transfer of sensitive data. We implemented and deployed this model on the Ethereum platform and conducted comprehensive performance evaluations. To assess the stealthiness of our approach, we employed a suite of statistical tests including the CDF, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, Welch’s t-test and K–L divergence. These analyses confirmed that amounts carrying concealed information were statistically indistinguishable from regular transactions, thus validating the effectiveness of our solution in maintaining the anonymity and confidentiality of information transmission within the blockchain ecosystem.",BSP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a74caaa4e69adc104d37d1445bf3ba1f97e57963,True
Enhancing Cloud Communication Security: A Blockchain-Powered Framework with Attribute-Aware Encryption,"The global production of information continuously increases in quantity and variety. However, the tools and technologies developed to handle such large volumes of data have not adequately met the security and privacy requirements. Existing cloud security systems, often managed by a trusted third party, are susceptible to various security risks. To address these challenges and ensure the protection of personal information, blockchain technology emerges as a crucial solution with substantial potential. This research uses the blockchain-powered attribute-aware encryption method to establish a real-time secure communication approach over the cloud. By employing attribute-based encryption technology, data owners can implement fine-grained search permissions for data users. The proposed solution incorporates accessible encryption technology to enable secure access to encrypted data and facilitate keyword searches on the blockchain. This study provides a functional comparison of recently developed attribute-based encryption algorithms. The access control strategy comprises two access tree types and a linear secret-sharing system, serving as the main components. The elliptic curve’s base field was set to 512b, and the bilinear pairing parameter type used was Type-A. This approach involves storing keywords on a remote server and encrypting them using attribute-based encryption. Furthermore, the encrypted data blockchain and the corresponding ciphertext are stored in the blockchain. Numerical experiments were conducted to evaluate the system’s key generation, trapdoor building, and keyword retrieval capabilities.",BSP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b21f7966b525f3764ff6dc294f8298aaa1412f02,True
"Blockchain-based decentralized trust management in IoT: systems, requirements and challenges","Internet of Things (IoT) vision has astoundingly transcended environmental sensing with integrated computing systems and smart devices, providing seamless connectivity among humans, machines, and their environment to cooperate for convenience and economical benefits. Apart from all the tremendous benefits of IoT, this paradigm still suffers from challenges of security and privacy vulnerabilities and demands a secure system for effective utilization of services in real-world IoT scenarios relying on which the IoT consumers expect secure and trustworthy communications. Trust Management (TM), which is a crucial aspect of security, plays a vital role in ensuring the exchange of information in a secure manner and maintaining the reliability of a system by measuring the degree of trust on IoT devices, reducing the uncertainties and risks involved in the systems. Thus, in recent years, Blockchain technology has been utilized for developing security innovations in TM field for different classes of IoT applications. It can provide tamper-proof data by enabling more reliable trust information and integrity verification, ultimately enhancing its availability and privacy when storing and sharing information. This paper provides a comprehensive survey that aims at analyzing and assessing Blockchain-based decentralized trust management systems (BCDTMS) for IoT. The contributions of this study are threefold; first, we provide the comprehensive and comparative analysis of state-of-the-art BCDTMS devised for different IoT classes such as Internet of Medical of Things (IoMT), Internet of Vehicles (IoV), Industrial IoT (IIoT), and Social IoT (SIoT). To make it an extensive study, we perform a detailed assessment of the existing BCDTMS in the literature in the aspects of Blockchain and TM.

Blockchain in Healthcare for Achieving Patients’ Privacy,"Heath data are sensitive and valuable for individuals. The patients need to integrate and manage their medical data continuously. Personal Health Record (PHR) is introduced as a solution for managing their health information. It gives patients ownership over their medical data and provides physicians with realignment data. However, it does not achieve reliability, traceability, trust, nor security of patient control. Centralization of any data is vulnerable to the problem of hacking and single failure in addition to control from one organization. So, the centralization of data is the common problem that all current healthcare systems suffer from. Even in the Metaverse world, the application of Metaverse in healthcare services loses users’ privacy as one of its challenges. In this study, we suggest using blockchain in healthcare to improve security and privacy in medical records. The proposed system employs the advantages of blockchain technology to give patients full control over their data with low throughput, high overhead, and latency. We present a security analysis of our suggested architecture as well as blockchain issues in healthcare systems.",BSP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c7800245e684a9ada089a11273c2a6d10d5dd9c6,True
Privacy Protection Scheme for Personal Health Record System Using Blockchain Based on Homomorphic Encryption,"With the advancement and popularization of science and technology, much research explores the provision of health care services or health management with the assistance of information technology in addition to traditional clinical diagnosis. Personal Health Records (PHR) are available for personalized health record information in the autonomous management system. The personal health record system is to improve disease management or strengthen personal health management. However, users are concerned about the safety and confidentiality of PHR in healthcare systems. In 2008, the blockchain architecture was proposed by Satoshi as a peer-to-peer network architecture that contains a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). In this study, we proposed a blockchain-based PHR system using the homomorphic encryption to improve the privacy and security of the users. It allows a third party to perform operations on the ciphertext which can be retrieved correctly later, while the privacy and security of the nodes on the chain are ensured and provided for multiple users to protect the security of their information.",BSP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/296b14e8b4310ec524c18e7c04e5d3b70828377b,True
HDM-Chain: A Secure Blockchain-based Healthcare Data Management framework to ensure Privacy and Security in the Health Unit,"In conventional medical data monitoring systems are suffering key challenges in phases of information immutability, traceability, transparency, observation, data validation, access permission, reliability, privacy, and safety. Personal Health Records(PHR) have various advantages globally, but at PHRs data is ruled to essential safety and privacy concerns. This paper suggests a method to implement a reliable clarification to these points. Traditionally sophisticated methods trading with the security of health records ordinarily makes information inaccessible system to patients. Certain methods struggle to adjust information reliability, patient desire, and regular communication with supplier information. Blockchain(BC) resolves the preceding difficulties from it shares data in a decentralized and transactional way. The utilize of BC could support the healthcare division to adjust the accessibility, privacy, and security of PHRs. This document suggests a BC framework to efficiently and securely collect and keep health records. It represents a reliable and skilled means of achieving healthcare data for patients, physicians, and security insurance agencies while defending the patients of information. The goal of this activity is to show how the suggested system fits the safety requirements of participants (patients), physicians, and third performances and discusses privacy and safety attention in the medical division.",BSP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/58d9a77e17e43a575a801f0bea4967a922fe0a8d,True
Privacy-Preserving in Healthcare Blockchain Systems Based on Lightweight Message Sharing,"Electronic medical records (EMRs) are extremely important for patients’ treatment, doctors’ diagnoses, and medical technology development. In recent years, the distributed healthcare blockchain system has been researched for solving the information isolated island problem in centralized healthcare service systems. However, there still exists a series of important problems such as the patients’ sensitive information security, cross-institutional data sharing, medical quality, and efficiency. In this paper, we establish a lightweight privacy-preserving mechanism for a healthcare blockchain system. First, we apply an interleaving encoder to encrypt the original EMRs. This can hide the sensitive information of EMRs to protect the patient’s privacy security. Second, a (t,n)-threshold lightweight message sharing scheme is presented. The EMRs are mapped to n different short shares, and it can be reconstructed by at least t shares. The EMR shares rather than the original EMRs are stored in the blockchain nodes. This can guarantee high security for EMR sharing and improve the data reconstruction efficiency. Third, the indexes of the stored EMR shares are employed to generate blocks that are chained together and finally form a blockchain. The authorized data users or institutions can recover an EMR by requesting at least t shares of the EMR from the blockchain nodes. In this way, the healthcare blockchain system can not only facilitate the cross-institution sharing process, but also provide proper protections for the EMRs. The security proof and analysis indicate that the proposed scheme can protect the privacy and security of patients’ medical information. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme is more efficient than similar literature in terms of energy consumption and storage space, and the healthcare blockchain system is more stable with the proposed message sharing scheme.",BSP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/317ea374fedbd4b3f71aa79130997a6d811220aa,True
A Secure and Privacy-Preserving Medical Data Sharing via Consortium Blockchain,"Medical data sharing is of great significance in promoting smart medicine. However, the heterogeneity of information systems used by various medical institutions makes sharing difficult. In addition, since medical data involves a great deal of sensitive information, sharing it could easily lead to the leakage of personal privacy. Blockchain, gained popularity as a distributed ledger technology, has great potential to connect heterogeneous systems and provides authenticity and integrity guarantees for medical data sharing. Focusing on the issues of medical data sharing and privacy protection, we propose a medical data sharing scheme based on consortium blockchain. To achieve access control, attribute-based access control technique is implemented, where patients preset attribute-specific access policies for their medical records, and record requesters are described by a set of attributes. For patients, we devise a hybrid storage mode to write access policies of medical records on the consortium blockchain network and store encrypted medical records off-chain. Leveraging blockchain and smart contracts, access privilege control and access history tracking can be realized. To enhance the key management, a tree of medical records is constructed for each patient, and by simply keeping the medical record trees, patients can recover their encryption keys at any time. Furthermore, we carry out an extensive analysis to show the high security and efficiency of our proposed scheme. Finally, we build a Quorum consortium blockchain on the Tencent Cloud and deploy smart contracts on the chain to simulate transactions in our scheme. The experiment results indicate the proposed scheme achieves good feasibility.",BSP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/18a8d9ff06aae31c7e23aa00cb9ffbae6d4e9f42,True
Optimizing Heterogeneity in IoT Infra Using Federated Learning and Blockchain-based Security Strategies,"The Internet of Things (IoT) and associated capabilities are becoming indispensable in the planning, operation, and administration of intricate systems of all sizes. High-end learning solutions that go beyond the boundaries of the problem are necessary for addressing the variety of communication concerns (compatibility, secure communication, etc.) in IoT settings. Building machine learning (ML) networks from disparate data sources is a cutting-edge practice known as Federated Learning (FL). In this article, we implement FL between edge-based servers and devices in a sparsely populated cloud to facilitate cohesive learning and the storage of critical information in smart IoT systems. FL enables collaborative training from a common model by aggregating smaller unit models via regulated edge network participants. Further, all the susceptible device’s information and sensitive message transactions are addressed via blockchain technology. Thus, a blockchain-based security mechanism is integrated to secure user privacy and facilitate widespread practical adoption. Finally, a comparison is made between the proposed model and the three best free, open-source Federated Learning models already in use (FedPD, FedProx, and FedAvg). In terms of statistical, and data heterogeneity (>70% SDI, >97% accuracy), the experimental findings suggest that the proposed model performs better than the existing techniques.",BSP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/75939d9e1821c35c42cd1208e4c0b2ad2c800c06,True
Security of Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Management Systems: Challenges and Opportunities,"Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that is being used in many applications, including supply chain management. Although, the primary motive of using a blockchain for supply chain management is to reduce the overall production cost while providing the comprehensive security to the system. However, current blockchain-based supply-chain management (BC-SCM) systems still hold the possibility of cyber attacks. Therefore, the goal of this study is to investigate practical threats and vulnerabilities in the design of BC-SCM systems. As a starting point, we first establish key requirements for the reliability and security of supply chain management systems, i.e., transparency, privacy and traceability, and then discern a threat model that includes two distinctive but practical threats including computational (i.e., the ones that threaten the functionality of the application) and communication (i.e., the ones that threaten information exchange among interconnected services of the application). For investigation, we follow a unique approach based on the hypothesis that reliability is pre-requisite of security and identify the threats considering (i) design of smart contracts and associated supply chain management applications, (ii) underlying blockchain execution environment and (iii) trust between all interconnected supply management services. Moreover, we consider both academic and industry solutions to identify the threats. We identify several challenges that hinder to establish reliability and security of the BC-SCM systems. Importantly, we also highlight research gaps that can help to establish desired security of the BC-SCM. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first effort that identifies practical threats to blockchain-based supply chain management systems and provides their counter measures. Finally, this work establishes foundation for future investigation towards practical security of BC-SCM system.",BSP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b1443fccba5b844c777bb6527a3e2c3d350a619d,True
ENSURING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONAL DATA AND SUPPORTING CYBER SECURITY WITH THE HELP OF BLOCKCHAIN,"The recent increase in security breaches and digital surveillance highlights the need to improve privacy and security, especially of users' personal data.

Blockchain Family Deed Certificate for Privacy and Data Security,"The rapid development of technology has caused some systems to have changed; most of them in the Industrial Revolution 4.0 era using new methods from various aspects of people's lives. Family Deed Certificate is a family identity that contains data about arrangements, relationships, and the number of family members. A family certificate is an essential thing for every citizen to have. However, related problems that occur are still using conventional systems that cause problems such as loss of family deed, and various manipulations of identity data. Thus, from this problem emerged a solution to guarantee all data and information security using blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is a technology for recording transactions with modern technology, which can only be added but cannot be changed or replaced. Blockchain technology can support various fields such as banking, education, health, and priorities for governance. For this research, this is applied in the field of government, which is a blockchain technology family certificate, various problems in terms of a family certificate that is a copy of a lot of family member data, and editing a deed of change, is very inflexible. With the family certificate system, blockchain technology, data security can be guaranteed so that there is no data falsification and can replace any loss on the family deed.

Blockchain for Email Security: A Perspective on Existing and Potential Solutions for Phishing Attacks,"Email security is critical to all types of businesses, as it represents 80% of the plethora of official communication tools used by most organizations worldwide. Attackers use several techniques to trick users to perform harmful actions, mainly via emails. Identifying such activities or circumventing them is better than relying on the end-user's behavior of being unaware. Traditional e-mail systems use centralized servers to provide services, making them a single point of failure if servers are attacked or at least private information is leaked. Thus, a decentralized e-mail system can provide more trust and reliability. This study is an initial attempt to explore the use of Blockchain-based solutions to improve the security and privacy of traditional e-mail systems. This paper presents two-fold coverage of this problem. First, a summary of common email security architectures is presented, outlined, and criticized for various parameters.

Enhancing the Security for Healthcare Data using Blockchain Technology,"Cyber security is the safest way to protect the data from hackers and unauthorized users. Healthcare technologies nowadays face lots of cyber security issues related with the security of the health information and privacy of the data. Cyber security is one of the popularized ways to protect the data from hackers and spammers. HealthCare is the field where the data is highly sensitive and the security for the systems is low. Protecting the sensitive data is achieved by the blockchain method, which is similar to a database but the difference is the data stored in the blockchain in blocks. The new blocks included are connected to previous blocks from a chain like structure, it is very secure, each block stores data and also the hash of previous blocks. So, data cannot be easily accessed or manipulated. The mechanism used in blockchain for the security of the data consensus mechanism which contains the different methodologies includes Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Proof of Space and Proof of Authority.

Hybrid blockchain–based privacy-preserving electronic medical records sharing scheme across medical information control system,"With the development of big data and medical information control system, electronic medical records sharing across organizations for better medical treatment and advancement has attracted much attention both from academic and industrial areas. However, the source of big data, personal privacy concern, inherent trust issues across organizations and complicated regulation hinder the great progress of healthcare intelligence. Blockchain, as a novel technique, has been used widely to resolve the privacy and security issues in electronic medical records sharing process. In this paper, we propose a hybrid blockchain–based electronic medical records sharing scheme to address the privacy and trust issues across the medical information control systems, rendering the electronic medical records sharing process secure, effective, relatively transparent, immutable, traceable and auditable. Considering the above confidential issues, we use different sharing methods for different parts of medical big data. We share privacy-sensitive couples on the consortium blockchain, while sharing the non-sensitive parts on the public blockchain. In this way, authorized medical information control systems within the consortium can access the data on it for precise medical diagnosis. Institutions such as universities and research institutes can get access to the non-sensitive parts of medical big data for scientific research on symptoms to evolve medical technologies. A working prototype is implemented to demonstrate how the hybrid blockchain facilitates the pharmaceutical operations in a healthcare information control ecosystem.

Business process improvement by means of Big Data based Decision Support Systems: a case study on Call Centers,"Big Data is a rapidly evolving and maturing field which places significant data storage and processing power at our disposal. To take advantage of this power, we need to create new means of collecting and processing large volumes of data at high speed. Meanwhile, as companies and organizations, such as health services, realize the importance and value of ""joined-up thinking"" across supply chains and healthcare pathways, for example, this creates a demand for a new type of approach to Business Activity Monitoring and Management. This new approach requires Big Data solutions to cope with the volume and speed of transactions across global supply chains.

Integrated Decision Support for Disaster Risk Management: Aiding Preparedness and Response Decisions in Wildfire Management,"A central challenge in disaster risk management (DRM) is that there are key dependencies and uncertainty between the decisions made at the mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery stages. Decision support systems for disaster management require information systems that allow timely and reliable integration of data sources from different domains, including information on hazards and vulnerabilities for risk analysis, as well as organizational and logistical information for decision analysis. We propose an analytics-centered framework that integrates predictive and prescriptive models responding to unique characteristics of DRM. The framework relies on probabilistic risk assessment and uses optimization-based simulation of the response phase as a means to inform decisions at the preparedness stage. This paper presents a case study regarding the analysis of preparedness and response decisions for wildfire control in Uruguay. Numerical results illustrate insights from the risk-informed analyses. For instance, slight reductions in the preparedness budget can lead to disproportionate losses during the response stage, whereas slight increases have little effect unless explicitly directed to control high-consequence scenarios. Motivated by a real-world problem, this case study emphasizes the challenges for integrated information systems that enable the potential of analytical decision support frameworks for DRM.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6358fc39963a353f6a2b1f037e40afac07da1aa2,True

Using health information technology for clinical decision support and predictive analytics,"JAMIA has been a premier venue for publication of scholarly work on clinical decision support systems since its inception. With an initial emphasis on knowledge-based systems, i.e., encoding of clinicians’ knowledge into rules that would trigger alerts and reminders, JAMIA evolved into a phase of an increasing number of articles reporting on the use of EHR “big data” to build and validate predictive models that recognize patterns in large amounts of data to derive actionable recommendations for clinicians. Interestingly, this is happening at the same time that health information technology (HIT) is still evolving, data quality in EHRs is being improved, and health information exchange (HIE) continues to be evaluated for cost effectiveness. Key recommendations for HIT optimization are proposed by Chresswell (p. 186). Additionally, Wright (p. 192) advocates for more testing of EHR systems, Alexander (p. 69) focuses on IT in nursing homes, and Kharrazi (p. 2) promotes an agenda for population health informatics. HIT use by office-based physicians and healthcare reform programs is described in a study by Heisey-Grove (p. 133). Improving the quality of EHRs is addressed by Van der Bij (p. 84) and Jamieson (p. 126). The latter describes a randomized trial on the quality of admission notes from EHRs. A systematic review of EHR usability is reported by Ellsworth (p. 222), Yadav (p. 143) compares EHRs with paper records in the documentation of physical exams, Denny (p. 165) describes hypertension “phenotyping” from EHRs, and Das (p. 24) proposes how to generate discharge recommendations. HIT is now pervasive in healthcare and this issue of JAMIA features several articles on the use of HIT for predictive modeling: Goldstein reviews risk prediction (p. 202) and describes the challenges in predicting mortality over time horizons (p. 180), GillameBert (p. 48) learns temporal rules that predict instability in patients undergoing continuous monitoring, and Lennon (p. 148) shows predictive value in particular combinations of pathology markers for pancreatic cysts. Manaktala (p. 91) proposes a clinical decision support system for sepsis mortality, and Haslam (p. 13) discovers disease relationships from clinical trial data. HIE systems help clinicians share information from a particular patient with each other. However, the cost effectiveness of various types of HIEs remains hard to measure. Downing (p. 116) reports on the policies of 11 health systems, Dixon (p. 99) describes the characteristics of veterans who enroll in HIE, Vest (p. 39) describes the organizational capacity and utility of clinical event notification, and Slovis (p. 30) studies the rate of duplicative CT exams. Pharmacy informatics is an important sub-field of specialization. Nelson (p. 197) describes the interaction between pharmacists and the EHR, and White (p. 175) reports on outcomes of a computerbased system for Vitamin D prescriptions. Medication reconciliation is systematically reviewed by Marien (p. 231). Also related to pharmacy are reports from Eschmann (p. 62), who describes a system to predict hyperkalemia from drug interactions, Heringa (p. 55), who shows how clustering related drug interaction alerts helps reduce the number of alerts, and Manzi (p. 77), who describes a clinical pharmacogenomics service. Other types of computer-based interaction with providers and patients are reported in this issue of the journal: McGrath (p. 213) systematically reviews computer-aided instruction in oral health, Ratanawongsa (p. 109) studies computer use and literacy in safety net outpatient communications, and Kelly (p. 156) reports how families stay engaged in pediatric care through a patient portal. HIT evolved rapidly in the past decade and is likely to continue to evolve at this pace until its many challenges are overcome. Our responsibility as professionals is to help drive HIT, clinical decision support, and predictive analytics to the next level, and to educate the next generation so that they can fill the many knowledge gaps that still exist.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2919141f2fd6672119744b5416fe80fe03f7c492,True
Machine Learning–Enabled Clinical Information Systems Using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources Data Standards: Scoping Review,"Background Machine learning–enabled clinical information systems (ML-CISs) have the potential to drive health care delivery and research. The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) data standard has been increasingly applied in developing these systems. However, methods for applying FHIR to ML-CISs are variable. Objective This study evaluates and compares the functionalities, strengths, and weaknesses of existing systems and proposes guidelines for optimizing future work with ML-CISs. Methods Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched for articles describing machine learning systems that were used for clinical data analytics or decision support in compliance with FHIR standards. Information regarding each system’s functionality, data sources, formats, security, performance, resource requirements, scalability, strengths, and limitations was compared across systems. Results A total of 39 articles describing FHIR-based ML-CISs were divided into the following three categories according to their primary focus: clinical decision support systems (n=18), data management and analytic platforms (n=10), or auxiliary modules and application programming interfaces (n=11). Model strengths included novel use of cloud systems, Bayesian networks, visualization strategies, and techniques for translating unstructured or free-text data to FHIR frameworks. Many intelligent systems lacked electronic health record interoperability and externally validated evidence of clinical efficacy. Conclusions Shortcomings in current ML-CISs can be addressed by incorporating modular and interoperable data management, analytic platforms, secure interinstitutional data exchange, and application programming interfaces with adequate scalability to support both real-time and prospective clinical applications that use electronic health record platforms with diverse implementations.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9bc39b9ad5760b766d2d43052cc73aa063246726,True

An AI-based Decision Support System for Predicting Mental Health Disorders,"Approximately one billion individuals suffer from mental health disorders, such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety. Mental health professionals use various assessment tools to detect and diagnose these disorders. However, these tools are complex, contain an excessive number of questions, and require a significant amount of time to administer, leading to low participation and completion rates. Additionally, the results obtained from these tools must be analyzed and interpreted manually by mental health professionals, which may yield inaccurate diagnoses. To this extent, this research utilizes advanced analytics and artificial intelligence to develop a decision support system (DSS) that can efficiently detect and diagnose various mental disorders. As part of the DSS development process, the Network Pattern Recognition (NEPAR) algorithm is first utilized to build the assessment tool and identify the questions that participants need to answer. Then, various machine learning models are trained using participants’ answers to these questions and other historical data as inputs to predict the existence and the type of their mental disorder. The results show that the proposed DSS can automatically diagnose mental disorders using only 28 questions without any human input, to an accuracy level of 89%. Furthermore, the proposed mental disorder diagnostic tool has significantly fewer questions than its counterparts; hence, it provides higher participation and completion rates. Therefore, mental health professionals can use this proposed DSS and its accompanying assessment tool for improved clinical decision-making and diagnostic accuracy.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03ae138c7b20d899d96b428cd9a2649e7fc8a829,True

Decision Support Systems in Temporomandibular Joint Osteoarthritis: A review of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Applications.,"With the exponential growth of computational systems and increased patient data acquisition, dental research faces new challenges to manage a large quantity of information. For this reason, data science approaches are needed for the integrative diagnosis of multifactorial diseases, such as Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) Osteoarthritis (OA). The Data science spectrum includes data capture/acquisition, data processing with optimized web-based storage and management, data analytics involving in-depth statistical analysis, machine learning (ML) approaches, and data communication. Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in this process. It consists of developing computational systems that can perform human intelligence tasks, such as disease diagnosis, using many features to help in the decision-making support. Patient's clinical parameters, imaging exams, and molecular data are used as the input in cross-validation tasks, and human annotation/diagnosis is also used as the gold standard to train computational learning models and automatic disease classifiers. This paper aims to review and describe AI and ML techniques to diagnose TMJ OA and data science approaches for imaging processing. We used a web-based system for multi-center data communication, algorithms integration, statistics deployment, and process the computational machine learning models. We successfully show AI and data-science applications using patients' data to improve the TMJ OA diagnosis decision-making towards personalized medicine.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a034a02ec75437b30e2438efa05ded5f174afc5f,True

Predictive analytics for data driven decision support in health and care,"Abstract Due to an ever-increasing amount of data generated in healthcare each day, healthcare professionals are more and more challenged with information. Predictive models based on machine learning algorithms can help to quickly identify patterns in clinical data. Requirements for data driven decision support systems for health and care (DS4H) are similar in many ways to applications in other domains. However, there are also various challenges which are specific to health and care settings. The present paper describes a) healthcare specific requirements for DS4H and b) how they were addressed in our Predictive Analytics Toolset for Health and care (PATH). PATH supports the following process: objective definition, data cleaning and pre-processing, feature engineering, evaluation, result visualization, interpretation and validation and deployment. The current state of the toolset already allows the user to switch between the various involved levels, i. e. raw data (ECG), pre-processed data (averaged heartbeat), extracted features (QT time), built models (to classify the ECG into a certain rhythm abnormality class) and outcome evaluation (e. g. a false positive case) and to assess the relevance of a given feature in the currently evaluated model as a whole and for the individual decision. This allows us to gain insights as a basis for improvements in the various steps from raw data to decisions.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/42a7db85a7413589b9f1d258d23072a3d045cedd,True
Revisiting Ralph Sprague's Framework for Developing Decision Support Systems,"Ralph H. Sprague Jr. was a leader in the MIS field and helped develop the conceptual foundation for decision support systems (DSS). In this paper, I pay homage to Sprague and his DSS contributions.

Impact of Predictive Analytics of Big Data in Supply Chain Management on Decision-Making,"The beginning of information technology has led to a burst of data in every sector of operation. Handling huge volume of data to mine useful information to support decision making is one of the current sources of competitive advantage for organizations. However, preceding research literature on predictive analytics has attributed a lack of direct causal influence on predictive analytics in a manner that support Supply Chain Management in utility companies’ performance. This is as a result of huge data posing great challenges to practitioners when incorporating it into their complex decision making which adds business value.

Machine learning in information systems - a bibliographic review and open research issues,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are currently hot topics in industry and business practice, while management-oriented research disciplines seem reluctant to adopt these sophisticated data analytics methods as research instruments. Even the Information Systems (IS) discipline with its close connections to Computer Science seems to be conservative when conducting empirical research endeavors. To assess the magnitude of the problem and to understand its causes, we conducted a bibliographic review on publications in high-level IS journals. We reviewed 1,838 articles that matched corresponding keyword-queries in journals from the AIS senior scholar basket, Electronic Markets and Decision Support Systems (Ranked B). In addition, we conducted a survey among IS researchers (N = 110). Based on the findings from our sample we evaluate different potential causes that could explain why ML methods are rather underrepresented in top-tier journals and discuss how the IS discipline could successfully incorporate ML methods in research undertakings.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e06e68cf27c9ab60676b2eafe35479bfbe37c94c,True
Internet of things and simulation approach for decision support system in lean manufacturing,"Today, Industry 4.0 concerns a rapid advancement in manufacturing technologies which help industries increase their productivity. To adopt Industry 4.0 concept is still visionary by certain lean manufacturers when the communication technologies interfaces are not fully equipped at the production system. Most of the facilities towards digitalization are also expensive and require many specialists in different fields to manage the technologies. Therefore, most data analytics (DA) engineering is cannot be employed broadly for process enhancement by Industry 4.0 environment. However, starting with Internet of Things (IOT) concepts, Andon system with simulation was enhanced to support decision making in lean manufacturing. The aims of this research paper is to develop a decision support system (DSS) framework which intersects between Andon and simulation through IOT concept.

Secured Big Data Analytics for Decision-Oriented Medical System Using Internet of Things,"The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has shown incredible development with the growth of medical systems using wireless information technologies. Medical devices are biosensors that can integrate with physical things to make smarter healthcare applications that are collaborated on the Internet. In recent decades, many applications have been designed to monitor the physical health of patients and support expert teams for appropriate treatment. The medical devices are attached to patients’ bodies and connected with a cloud computing system for obtaining and analyzing healthcare data. However, such medical devices operate on battery powered sensors with limiting constraints in terms of memory, transmission, and processing resources. Many healthcare solutions are helping the community with the efficient monitoring of patients’ conditions using cloud computing, however, mostly incur latency in data collection and storage. Therefore, this paper presents a model for the Secured Big Data analytics using Edge–Cloud architecture (SBD-EC), which aims to provide distributed and timely computation of a decision-oriented medical system. Moreover, the mobile edges cooperate with the cloud level to present a secure algorithm, achieving reliable availability of medical data with privacy and security against malicious actions.

Reference architecture design for farm management information systems: a multi-case study approach,"One of the key elements of precision agriculture is the farm management information system (FMIS) that is responsible for data management, analytics and subsequent decision support. Various FMISs have been developed to support the management of farm businesses. A key artefact in the development of FMISs is the software architecture that defines the gross level structure of the system. The software architecture is important for understanding the system, analysing the design decisions and guiding the further development of the system based on the architecture. To assist in the design of the FMIS architecture, several reference architectures have been provided in the literature. Unfortunately, in practice, it is less trivial to derive the application architecture from these reference architectures. Two underlying reasons for this were identified. First of all, it appears that the proposed reference architectures do not specifically focus on FMIS but have a rather broad scope of the agricultural domain in general. Secondly, the proposed reference architectures do not seem to have followed the proper architecture documentation guidelines as defined in the software architecture community, lack precision, and thus impeding the design of the required application architectures. Presented in this article is a novel reference architecture that is dedicated to the specific FMIS domain, and which is documented using the software architecture documentation guidelines. In addition, the systematic approach for deriving application architectures from the proposed reference architecture is provided. To illustrate the approach, the results of multi-case study research are shown in which the presented reference architecture is used for deriving different FMIS application architectures.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f3c79f628a7a83840a200ad47aaadfb4a2531a35,True
Machine Learning and Decision Support in Critical Care,"Clinical data management systems typically provide caregiver teams with useful information, derived from large, sometimes highly heterogeneous, data sources that are often changing dynamically. Over the last decade there has been a significant surge in interest in using these data sources, from simply reusing the standard clinical databases for event prediction or decision support, to including dynamic and patient-specific information into clinical monitoring and prediction problems. However, in most cases, commercial clinical databases have been designed to document clinical activity for reporting, liability, and billing reasons, rather than for developing new algorithms. With increasing excitement surrounding “secondary use of medical records” and “Big Data” analytics, it is important to understand the limitations of current databases and what needs to change in order to enter an era of “precision medicine.” This review article covers many of the issues involved in the collection and preprocessing of critical care data. The three challenges in critical care are considered: compartmentalization, corruption, and complexity. A range of applications addressing these issues are covered, including the modernization of static acuity scoring; online patient tracking; personalized prediction and risk assessment; artifact detection; state estimation; and incorporation of multimodal data sources such as genomic and free text data.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/21aab5bccf63e1f7a7e5676c129f7ad5a53eb84e,True

Improving Decision Analytics with Deep Learning: the Case of Financial Disclosures,"Decision analytics commonly focuses on the text mining of financial news sources in order to provide managerial decision support and to predict stock market movements. Existing predictive frameworks almost exclusively apply traditional machine learning methods, whereas recent research indicates that traditional machine learning methods are not sufficiently capable of extracting suitable features and capturing the non-linear nature of complex tasks. As a remedy, novel deep learning models aim to overcome this issue by extending traditional neural network models with additional hidden layers. Indeed, deep learning has been shown to outperform traditional methods in terms of predictive performance. In this paper, we adapt the novel deep learning technique to financial decision support. In this instance, we aim to predict the direction of stock movements following financial disclosures. As a result, we show how deep learning can outperform the accuracy of random forests as a benchmark for machine learning by 5.66%.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/37939a99b450f449a02a52dfb71a9dc6157b88f8,True

Design principles for artificial intelligence-augmented decision making: An action design research study,"ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have proliferated, garnering significant interest among information systems (IS) scholars. AI-powered analytics, promising effective and low-cost decision augmentation, has become a ubiquitous aspect of contemporary organisations. Unlike traditional decision support systems (DSS) designed to support decisionmakers with fixed decision rules and models that often generate stable outcomes and rely on human agentic primacy, AI systems learn, adapt, and act autonomously, demanding recognition of IS agency within AI-augmented decision making (AIADM) systems. Given this fundamental shift in DSS; its influence on autonomy, responsibility, and accountability in decision making within organisations; the increasing regulatory and ethical concerns about AI use; and the corresponding risks of stochastic outputs, the extrapolation of prescriptive design knowledge from conventional DSS to AIADM is problematic. Hence, novel design principles incorporating contextual idiosyncrasies and practice-based domain knowledge are needed to overcome unprecedented challenges when adopting AIADM. To this end, we conduct an action design research (ADR) study within an e-commerce company specialising in producing and selling clothing. We develop an AIADM system to support marketing, consumer engagement, and product design decisions. Our work contributes to theory and practice with a set of actionable design principles to guide AIADM system design and deployment.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7f51651d5b9e7b7b2555ef75a17bda6dcd46815e,True
Unity Decision Guidance Management System: Analytics Engine and Reusable Model Repository,"Enterprises across all industries increasingly depend on decision guidance systems to facilitate decisionmaking across all lines of business. Despite significant technological advances, current paradigms for developing decision guidance systems lead to a tight-integration of the analytic models, algorithms and underlying tools that comprise these systems, which inhibits both reusability and interoperability. To address these limitations, this paper focuses on the development of the Unity analytics engine, which enables the construction of decision guidance systems from a repository of reusable analytic models that are expressed in JSONiq. Unity extends JSONiq with support for algebraic modeling using a symbolic computation-based technique and compiles reusable analytic models into lower-level, tool-specific representations for analysis. In this paper, we also propose a conceptual architecture for a Decision Guidance Management System, based on Unity, to support the rapid development of decision guidance systems. Finally, we conduct a preliminary experimental study on the overhead introduced by automatically translating reusable analytic models into tool-specific representations for analysis. Initial results indicate that the execution times of optimization models that are automatically generated by Unity from reusable analytic models are within a small constant factor of that of corresponding, manually-crafted optimization models.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a1a0d65c1121d42b33df3de80109f00c7cd0aacc,True
Supporting Decision-Making for Promoting Teaching and Learning Innovation: A Multiple Case Study,"The quality of the data and the amount of correct information available is key to informed decision-making. Higher education institutions (HEIs) often employ various decision support systems (DSSs) to make better choices. However, there is a lack of systems to assist with decision-making to promote innovation in teaching and learning. In this study, we evaluate an analytic tool called PROF-XXI that supports strategic decision-making of teaching and learning centres (TLCs) by identifying their competencies in teaching and learning innovation. Through a multiple case study conducted with three Latin American universities and supported by quantitative and qualitative data, we observed how this tool is used and how it facilitates strategic decision-making. Our findings indicate that the tool is accessible, user-friendly, and effective in 1) initiating identification and systematic reflection of institutional competency levels in teaching and learning innovation, 2) enhancing understanding of strengths and weaknesses as well as identifying opportunities for innovation, 3) supporting TLCs with short- and long-term decision-making, and 4) continuously evaluating their strategies, programs, and initiatives.

Not seeing the (moral) forest for the trees? How task complexity and employees’ expertise affect moral disengagement with discriminatory data analytics recommendations,"Data analytics provides versatile decision support to help employees tackle the rising complexity of today’s business decisions. Notwithstanding the benefits of these systems, research has shown their potential for provoking discriminatory decisions. While technical causes have been studied, the human side has been mostly neglected, albeit employees mostly still need to decide to turn analytics recommendations into actions. Drawing upon theories of technology dominance and of moral disengagement, we investigate how task complexity and employees’ expertise affect the approval of discriminatory data analytics recommendations. Through two online experiments, we confirm the important role of advantageous comparison, displacement of responsibility, and dehumanization, as the cognitive moral disengagement mechanisms that facilitate such approvals. While task complexity generally enhances these mechanisms, expertise retains a critical role in analytics-supported decision-making processes. Importantly, we find that task complexity’s effects on users’ dehumanization vary: more data subjects increase dehumanization, whereas richer information on subjects has the opposite effect. By identifying the cognitive mechanisms that facilitate approvals of discriminatory data analytics recommendations, this study contributes toward designing tools, methods, and practices that combat unethical consequences of using these systems.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/316af19ab8f6c08f0331bb6adba18fa0872653d3,True

Explainable Student Agency Analytics,"Several studies have shown that complex nonlinear learning analytics (LA) techniques outperform the traditional ones. However, the actual integration of these techniques in automatic LA systems remains rare because they are generally presumed to be opaque. At the same time, the current reviews on LA in higher education point out that LA should be more grounded to the learning science with actual linkage to teachers and pedagogical planning. In this study, we aim to address these two challenges. First, we discuss different techniques that open up the decision-making process of complex techniques and how they can be integrated in LA tools. More precisely, we present various global and local explainable techniques with an example of an automatic LA process that provides information about different resources that can support student agency in higher education institutes. Second, we exemplify these techniques and the LA process through recently collected student agency data in four courses of the same content taught by four different teachers. Altogether, we demonstrate how this process—which we call explainable student agency analytics—can contribute to teachers’ pedagogical planning through the LA cycle.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d823cf50ba80fa50e0ebb0a2caf9eeded2251b9d,True

In this study, we analyze data collected through a set of in-depth interviews of small and medium-sized freemium game developers. We identify four main roles of game analytics: 1) sense-making device, 2) decision-support system, 3) communication tool, and 4) hygiene factor. We employ the attention-based view of the firm to discuss how these roles diverge and converge in terms of organizational attention. The study advances the research on the roles and business value of analytics in the game and software industry.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67be9fa3b522a1c9515d594aadfa2d1b54eb4f0c,True
Business Analytics in the Context of Big Data: A Roadmap for Research,"This paper builds on academic and industry discussions from the 2012 and 2013 pre-ICIS events: BI Congress III and the Special Interest Group on Decision Support Systems (SIGDSS) workshop, respectively. Recognizing the potential of “big data” to offer new insights for decision making and innovation, panelists at the two events discussed how organizations can use and manage big data for competitive advantage. In addition, expert panelists helped to identify research gaps. While emerging research in the academic community identifies some of the issues in acquiring, analyzing, and using big data, many of the new developments are occurring in the practitioner community. We bridge the gap between academic and practitioner research by presenting a big data analytics framework that depicts a process view of the components needed for big data analytics in organizations. Using practitioner interviews and literature from both academia and practice, we identify the current state of big data research guided by the framework and propose potential areas for future research to increase the relevance of academic research to practice.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a0ff514a8a64ba5a7cd7430ca04245fd037d040c,True
Comparing the utility of decision trees and support vector machines when planning inspections of linear sewer infrastructure,"Closed-circuit television inspection technology is traditionally used to identify aging sewer pipes requiring rehabilitation. While these inspections provide essential information on the condition of pipes hidden from day-to-day view, they are expensive and often limited to small portions of an entire sewer system. Municipalities may benefit from utilizing predictive analytics to leverage existing inspection datasets so that reliable predictions of condition are available for pipes that have not yet been inspected. The predictive capabilities of data mining systems, namely support vector machines (SVMs) and decision tree classifiers, are demonstrated using a case study of sanitary sewer pipe inspection data collected by the municipality of Guelph, Ontario, Canada. The modeling algorithms are implemented using open-source software and are tuned to counteract the negative impact on predictive performance resulting from class imbalance common within pipe inspection datasets. The decision tree classifier outperforms SVM for this classification task – achieving an acceptable area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77 and an overall accuracy of 76% on a stratified test set. Although predicting individual pipe condition is a notoriously difficult task, decision trees are found to be a useful screening tool for planning future inspection-related activities.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4fdc4a0147db8d336afd09900191c7d9a6432195,True

Schema on read modeling approach as a basis of big data analytics integration in EIS,"ABSTRACT Big Data analysis is the process that can help organizations to make better business decisions. Organizations use data warehouses and business intelligence systems, i.e. enterprise information systems (EISs), to support and improve their decision-making processes. Since the ultimate goal of using EISs and Big Data analytics is the same, a logical task is to enable these systems to work together. In this paper we propose a framework of cooperation of these systems, based on the schema on read modeling approach and data virtualization. The goal of data virtualization process is to hide technical details related to data storage from applications and to display heterogeneous data sources as one integrated data source. We have tested the proposed model in a case study in the transportation domain.

Addressing the Complexities of Big Data Analytics in Healthcare: The Diabetes Screening Case,"The healthcare industry generates a high throughput of medical, clinical and omics data of varying complexity and features. Clinical decision-support is gaining widespread attention as medical institutions and governing bodies turn towards better management of this data for effective and efficient healthcare delivery and quality assured outcomes. Amass of data across all stages, from disease diagnosis to palliative care, is further indication of the opportunities and challenges to effective data management, analysis, prediction and optimization techniques as parts of knowledge management in clinical environments. Big Data analytics (BDA) presents the potential to advance this industry with reforms in clinical decision-support and translational research. However, adoption of big data analytics has been slow due to complexities posed by the nature of healthcare data. The success of these systems is hard to predict, so further research is needed to provide a robust framework to ensure investment in BDA is justified. In this paper we investigate these complexities from the perspective of updated Information Systems (IS) participation theory.

Integrated Care and Connected Health Approaches Leveraging Personalised Health through Big Data Analytics,"Integrated care and connected health are two fast evolving concepts that have the potential to leverage personalised health. From the one side, the restructuring of care models and implementation of new systems and integrated care programs providing coaching and advanced intervention possibilities, enable medical decision support and personalized healthcare services. From the other side, the connected health ecosystem builds the means to follow and support citizens via personal health systems in their everyday activities and, thus, give rise to an unprecedented wealth of data. These approaches are leading to the deluge of complex data, as well as in new types of interactions with and among users of the healthcare ecosystem. The main challenges refer to the data layer, the information layer, and the output of information processing and analytics. In all the above mentioned layers, the primary concern is the quality both in data and information, thus, increasing the need for filtering mechanisms. Especially in the data layer, the big biodata management and analytics ecosystem is evolving, telemonitoring is a step forward for data quality leverage, with numerous challenges still left to address, partly due to the large number of micro-nano sensors and technologies available today, as well as the heterogeneity in the users' background and data sources.

"Prediction of In-hospital Mortality in Emergency Department Patients With Sepsis: A Local Big Data-Driven, Machine Learning Approach.","OBJECTIVES Predictive analytics in emergency care has mostly been limited to the use of clinical decision rules (CDRs) in the form of simple heuristics and scoring systems. In the development of CDRs, limitations in analytic methods and concerns with usability have generally constrained models to a preselected small set of variables judged to be clinically relevant and to rules that are easily calculated. Furthermore, CDRs frequently suffer from questions of generalizability, take years to develop, and lack the ability to be updated as new information becomes available. Newer analytic and machine learning techniques capable of harnessing the large number of variables that are already available through electronic health records (EHRs) may better predict patient outcomes and facilitate automation and deployment within clinical decision support systems. In this proof-of-concept study, a local, big data-driven, machine learning approach is compared to existing CDRs and traditional analytic methods using the prediction of sepsis in-hospital mortality as the use case. METHODS This was a retrospective study of adult ED visits admitted to the hospital meeting criteria for sepsis from October 2013 to October 2014. Sepsis was defined as meeting criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome with an infectious admitting diagnosis in the ED. ED visits were randomly partitioned into an 80%/20% split for training and validation. A random forest model (machine learning approach) was constructed using over 500 clinical variables from data available within the EHRs of four hospitals to predict in-hospital mortality. The machine learning prediction model was then compared to a classification and regression tree (CART) model, logistic regression model, and previously developed prediction tools on the validation data set using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and chi-square statistics. RESULTS There were 5,278 visits among 4,676 unique patients who met criteria for sepsis. Of the 4,222 patients in the training group, 210 (5.0%) died during hospitalization, and of the 1,056 patients in the validation group, 50 (4.7%) died during hospitalization. The AUCs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the different models were as follows: random forest model, 0.86 (95% CI = 0.82 to 0.90); CART model, 0.69 (95% CI = 0.62 to 0.77); logistic regression model, 0.76 (95% CI = 0.69 to 0.82); CURB-65, 0.73 (95% CI = 0.67 to 0.80); MEDS, 0.71 (95% CI = 0.63 to 0.77); and mREMS, 0.72 (95% CI = 0.65 to 0.79). The random forest model AUC was statistically different from all other models (p ≤ 0.003 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS In this proof-of-concept study, a local big data-driven, machine learning approach outperformed existing CDRs as well as traditional analytic techniques for predicting in-hospital mortality of ED patients with sepsis. Future research should prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of this approach and whether it translates into improved clinical outcomes for high-risk sepsis patients. The methods developed serve as an example of a new model for predictive analytics in emergency care that can be automated, applied to other clinical outcomes of interest, and deployed in EHRs to enable locally relevant clinical predictions.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/970adc0c514bacabd7a6e25e6d6a4141b6fb8f08,True

A Big Data Framework for Decision Making in Supply Chain,"The advent of information and communication technologies (ICT) ushers a cost-effective prospect to take care of large volumes of complex data, commonly known as “big data” in the supply chain operational environment. Big data is being generated today by web applications, social media, intelligent machines, sensors, mobile phones, and other smart handheld devices. Big data is characterized in terms of the velocity, volume, and variety with which it produces along the supply chain.

SNAPS: Sensor Analytics Point Solutions for Detection and Decision Support Systems,"In this review, we discuss the role of sensor analytics point solutions (SNAPS), a reduced complexity machine-assisted decision support tool. We summarize the approaches used for mobile phone-based chemical/biological sensors, including general hardware and software requirements for signal transduction and acquisition. We introduce SNAPS, part of a platform approach to converge sensor data and analytics.

This approach improves the accuracy and effectiveness of energy management analytics while promoting transparency and trust in the decision-making process. The methodology is structured around an iterative development lifecycle for an intelligent decision support system and includes several steps, such as stakeholder identification, an empirical study on usability and explainability, user clustering analysis, and the implementation of an XAI framework. The XAI framework comprises XAI clusters and local and global XAI, which facilitate higher adoption rates of the AI system and ensure responsible and safe deployment.

Managing bias and unfairness in data for decision support: a survey of machine learning and data engineering approaches to identify and mitigate bias and unfairness within data management and analytics systems,"The increasing use of data-driven decision support systems in industry and governments is accompanied by the discovery of a plethora of bias and unfairness issues in the outputs of these systems. Multiple computer science communities, and especially machine learning, have started to tackle this problem, often developing algorithmic solutions to mitigate biases to obtain fairer outputs. However, one of the core underlying causes for unfairness is bias in training data which is not fully covered by such approaches. Especially, bias in data is not yet a central topic in data engineering and management research. We survey research on bias and unfairness in several computer science domains, distinguishing between data management publications and other domains. This covers the creation of fairness metrics, fairness identification, and mitigation methods, software engineering approaches and biases in crowdsourcing activities. We identify relevant research gaps and show which data management activities could be repurposed to handle biases and which ones might reinforce such biases. In the second part, we argue for a novel data-centered approach overcoming the limitations of current algorithmic-centered methods. This approach focuses on eliciting and enforcing fairness requirements and constraints on data that systems are trained, validated, and used on. We argue for the need to extend database management systems to handle such constraints and mitigation methods.

Development of IoT—enabled data analytics enhance decision support system for lean manufacturing process improvement,"For over three decades, production firms have extensively espoused lean manufacturing (LM) approach for constantly enhancing their operations. Of late, due to the fusion of physical and digital systems within the Industry 4.0 evolution, production systems can upgrade by applying both notions and lift operational excellence to a new high. This is primarily the reason why digital business transformation has gained significance. Moreover, Industry 4.0 that is led by data assures huge strides in output. The sheer volume of pertinent data from the production systems employing servers, sensors, and cloud computing have made the data exchange procedure more gigantic and intricate. However, conventional systems do not extensively support LM in the context of Industry 4.0. Moreover, the previous studies by researchers in the same field, shown that there was no standard platform to manage the new technologies in LM. This study presents a discussion on the interrelated framework about the way Industry 4.0 has transformed production into an industry focusing on connective mechanisms and platforms which utilize data analytics from the real world.

Although there is a large number of VA systems to facilitate the process of analysis and decision making, there is a lack of an adequate overview of what already exists in this area for SC management. To address that need, we conducted a systematic literature review to analyze the state of the art in SC VA systems. Particularly, we focus on use cases, the type of the decisions that a VA system intended to support, the type of visualizations employed, the type of analytics used, and the data that has been used for analysis. The goal of this study is to provide SC and VA researchers with an overview of the works carried out in the field of SC VA, helping them to observe latest trends and to recognize existing gaps that need further investigation. Consequently, a mapping between decisions of various SC business processes and their reciprocal visualization techniques and tactics have been provided. Adding to that, VA applications and use cases in SC are identified based on the SC Operation Reference (SCOR) model and underlying decision areas are recognized.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1997b46dee19118505c573106ea21ea2dece8c00,True
A Human(e) Factor in Clinical Decision Support Systems,"The overwhelming amount, production speed, multidimensionality, and potential value of data currently available—often simplified and referred to as big data —exceed the limits of understanding of the human brain. At the same time, developments in data analytics and computational power provide the opportunity to obtain new insights and transfer data-provided added value to clinical practice in real time. What is the role of the health care professional in collaboration with the data scientist in the changing landscape of modern care? We discuss how health care professionals should provide expert knowledge in each of the stages of clinical decision support design: data level, algorithm level, and decision support level. Including various ethical considerations, we advocate for health care professionals to responsibly initiate and guide interprofessional teams, including patients, and embrace novel analytic technologies to translate big data into patient benefit driven by human(e) values.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e04b8d2e2490db7bab3349bcf5667e873472adef,True
Challenges in Using Big Data to Develop Decision Support Systems for Social Work in Germany,"Abstract Nowadays, big data analytics are increasingly replacing human decision-making processes in practice fields. In the welfare context, however, they are still being explored only marginally. The following theoretical discussion draws on the example of the MAEWIN project to explore the challenges of using big data when developing decision support systems in the context of social work. The project reveals some similarities with the well-known challenges of big data research (e.g., with regard to data protection, bias, and handling probabilities). However, it also has to face further challenges such as the different knowledge approaches within social work.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1cae2b9d38cb0a59953613174c971e41fa506257,True
Prescriptive Maintenance of Railway Infrastructure: From Data Analytics to Decision Support,"One of the main benefits of the railways digital transformation is the possibility of increasing the efficiency of the Asset Management process through the combination of data-driven models and decision support systems, paving the road towards an Intelligent Asset Management System (IAMS). The paper describes the whole IAMS decisional process based on a real railway signaling use case: from field data acquisition to decision support. The process includes data collection, preparation and analytics to extract knowledge on current and future assets’ status. Then, the extracted knowledge is used within the decision support system to prioritize asset management interventions in a fully-automated way, by applying optimization logics and operational constraints.The target is to optimize the scheduling of maintenance activities, to maximize the service reliability and optimize both usage of resources and possession times, avoiding (or minimizing) contractual penalties and delays.In this context, a real use case related to signaling system and, in particular, to track circuits, is presented, applying the proposed methodology to an Italian urban rail network and showing the usefulness of the approach and its possible further developments.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b98a5d0188fb0e4936102cd02d39f58ca5a1513d,True
Decision Support Systems in Fisheries and Aquaculture: A systematic review,Decision support systems help decision makers make better decisions in the face of complex decision problems (e.g. investment or policy decisions). Fisheries and Aquaculture is a domain where decision makers face such decisions since they involve factors from many different scientific fields. No systematic overview of literature describing decision support systems and their application in fisheries and aquaculture has been conducted. This paper summarizes scientific literature that describes decision support systems applied to the domain of Fisheries and Aquaculture. We use an established systematic mapping survey method to conduct our literature mapping. Our research questions are: What decision support systems for fisheries and aquaculture exists? What are the most investigated fishery and aquaculture decision support systems topics and how have these changed over time? Do any current DSS for fisheries provide real- time analytics? Do DSSes in Fisheries and Aquaculture build their models using machine learning done on captured and grounded data? The paper then detail how we employ the systematic mapping method in answering these questions. This results in 27 papers being identified as relevant and gives an exposition on the primary methods concluded in the study for designing a decision support system. We provide an analysis of the research done in the studies collected. We discovered that most literature does not consider multiple aspects for multiple stakeholders in their work. In addition we observed that little or no work has been done with real-time analysis in these decision support systems.,DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b098909b4e545d7ff217bcaecb910cf12c0e3083,True

Intelligent Learning Analytics Dashboards: Automated Drill-Down Recommendations to Support Teacher Data Exploration,"Learning analytics dashboards commonly visualize data about students with the aim of helping students and educators understand and make informed decisions about the learning process. To assist with making sense of complex and multidimensional data, many learning analytics systems and dashboards have relied strongly on AI algorithms based on predictive analytics. While predictive models have been successful in many domains, there is an increasing realization of the inadequacies of using predictive models in decision-making tasks that affect individuals without human oversight. In this paper, we employ a suite of state-of-the-art algorithms, from the online analytics processing, data mining, and process mining domains, to present an alternative human-in-the-loop AI method to enable educators to identify, explore, and use appropriate interventions for subpopulations of students with the highest deviation in performance or learning process compared to the rest of the class. We demonstrate an application of our proposed approach in an existing learning analytics dashboard (LAD) and explore the recommended drill-downs in a course with 875 students. The demonstration provides an example of the recommendations from real course data and shows how recommendations can lead the user to interesting insights. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our approach can be employed to develop intelligent LADs.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80e4fa527553ef299911ae704f7e16aee654a78a,True
A Malaria Analytics Framework to Support Evolution and Interoperability of Global Health Surveillance Systems,"Malaria is a leading cause of death in Africa. Many organizations, NGO’s, and government agencies are collaborating to prevent, control, and eliminate malaria. In order to succeed in these shared goals, an integrated, consistent knowledge source to empower informed decision-making is required. Malaria surveillance is currently performed using dynamic, interconnected, systems which require rapid data exchange between different platforms. An important challenge these systems must overcome is the occurrence of dynamic changes in one or more interacting components, which can lead to inconsistencies and mismatches between components of the infrastructure. In this paper, we present our efforts toward the design and development of the semantic interoperability and evolution for malaria analytics platform, with the goal of improving data and semantic interoperability for dynamic malaria surveillance and to support the integration of data across multiple scales. The long term target is to deliver transparent and scalable tools for decision making for malaria elimination.

Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to further revolutionise the integration of human and artificial learning and will impact human and machine collaboration during team work (Seeber et al., 2020).,Complex problem-solving has been identified as one of the key skills for the future workforce (Hager and Beckett, 2019). Problems faced by today's workforce emerge in situ and everyday workplace learning is seen as an effective way to develop the skills and experience workers need to embrace these problems (Campbell, 2005; Jonassen et al., 2006).,In this commentary the authors argue that the increased digitization of work and social interaction, combined with recent research on workplace learning analytics and AI opens up the possibility for designing automated real-time feedback systems capable of just-in-time, just-in-place support during complex problem-solving at work. As such, these systems can support augmented learning and professional development in situ.,The commentary reflects on the benefits of automated real-time feedback systems and argues for the need of shared research agenda to cohere research in the direction of AI-enabled workplace analytics and real-time feedback to support learning and development in the workplace.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7e1c9cf4ee809fbc170db4f5b791e1ec2f727850,True
Adapted Visual Analytics Process for Intelligent Decision-Making: Application in a Medical Context,"The theoretical and practical researches on Visual Analytics for intelligent decision-making tasks have remarkably advanced in the past few years. Intelligent Decision Support Systems (IDSS) introduce effective and efficient paths from raw data to decision by involving visualization and data mining technologies. Data mining-based DSS produces potentially interesting patterns from data. The transition from extracted patterns to knowledge is a delicate task. In this context, we propose to adapt a common visual analytics process for creating a path that enables the user (decision-maker) to automatically explore and visually extract insights by interacting with the patterns. This proposal is inspired from integrating traditional visual analytics concepts with the mental model of knowledge visualization. The idea is to combine an automatic and visual analysis of patterns to generate knowledge for the purpose of decision-making. To validate our proposal, we have applied it to a medical case study for the fight against Nosocomial Infections in Intensive Care Units.

Prospects and challenges for clinical decision support in the era of big data.,"Recently, there has been burgeoning interest in developing more effective and robust clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) for oncology. This has been primarily driven by the demands for more personalized and precise medical practice in oncology in the era of so-called Big Data (BD); an era that promises to harness the power of large-scale data flow to revolutionize cancer treatment. This interest in BD analytics has created new opportunities as well as new unmet challenges. These include: routine aggregation and standardization of clinical data; patient privacy; transformation of current analytical approaches to handle such noisy and heterogeneous data; and expanded use of advanced statistical learning methods based on confluence of modern statistical methods and machine learning algorithms. In this review, we present the current status of CDSSs in oncology, the prospects and current challenges of BD analytics, and the promising role of integrated modern statistics and machine learning algorithms in predicting complex clinical endpoints, individualizing treatment rules, and optimizing dynamic personalized treatment regimens. We discuss issues pertaining to these topics and present application examples from an aggregate of experiences. We also discuss the role of human factors in improving the utilization and acceptance of such enhanced CDSSs and how to mitigate possible sources of human error to achieve optimal performance and wider acceptance.",DSA,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80c96915b6d40ec84843ca575b54355ee1c9c76c,True

Predictive Risk Analytics for Weather-Resilient Operation of Electric Power Systems,"Day-to-day operation of the electricity grid generation, transmission, and distribution is environmentally driven and closely dependent on evolving weather patterns. This paper introduces several new weather-driven analytics for accurate spatial–temporal electricity generation forecasts, asset health and reliability assessment, probabilistic load forecasts, and electricity market simulations. A new risk metric is suggested, which accounts for the weather hazards, grid vulnerability, and financial consequences in the face of changing weather patterns and associated meteorological predictions over time. New mitigation formulations for power system topology control through transmission line switching for fast and timely recovery of the weather-caused electricity outages are suggested. The proposed decision support tool enables the operators to predictively evaluate the high-risk weather threats and consequently plan on how to safeguard the grid when exposed to forecasted weather-driven incidents.

An integrated framework of enterprise information systems in smart manufacturing system via business process reengineering,"Enterprise information systems play a significant role in the Industry 4.0 era and are the crucial component to realize smart manufacturing systems. However, traditional enterprise information systems have some limits: (1) lack of complete information, (2) only satisfy limited business needs, and (3) lack of seamless integration, business intelligence, value-driven processes, and dynamic optimization. Clearly, the existing enterprise information systems are unable to satisfy the requirements for smart manufacturing systems: (1) autonomous operation, (2) sustainable values, and (3) self-optimization. In addition, smart manufacturing systems have become more efficient and effective, demanding for seamless information flow in enterprise information systems, knowledge, and data-driven accurately decision. Therefore, a new enterprise information systems framework is needed to bridge gaps between the requirements for traditional manufacturing system and smart manufacturing system. In this article, the integrative framework is proposed based on the business process reengineering, lean thinking, and intelligent management methods, with inclusion of six enterprise information systems aspects to provide upgrading guidelines from traditional manufacturing to smart manufacturing. The procedure of this method contains three steps: (1) it identifies requirements and acquires best practices using AS-IS model, (2) it redesigns six aspects of enterprise information systems using TO-BE model, and (3) it proposes a new enterprise information systems framework.

The Effect of Enterprise Systems Implementation on the Firm Information Environment,"This study uses an archival research design to assess the impact of enterprise systems on a firm's internal information environment as reflected in the production of management earnings forecasts. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that, if enterprise systems improve management's access to decision-relevant internal information, higher quality management earnings forecasts should ensue. Consistent with disclosure theory and the purported technical characteristics of enterprise systems, the authors find a positive association between enterprise system implementations and subsequent increases in the likelihood of management forecast issuance and the accuracy of the forecasts. Additional robustness tests support the argument that improvements in management forecasts are due to improvements in the firm's internal information environment rather than to enhancements in management's ability to manage earnings. Beyond accumulating financial reporting information, the authors note that such systems provide management with information to make day-to-day operational decisions. Moreover, the paper provides a basis for considering management forecast qualities as a measurable proxy for improvements in the firm's internal information environment that result from information technology investments.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6917d9b416cd431387f9c8c4d5f942b158b3172a,True

Future Work and Enterprise Systems,"From its earliest days, research in business and information systems engineering (BISE) has been dedicated to envisioning how information technology will change the way we work and live. Today, technological innovation happens at a faster pace and reaches users more quickly than ever before. For example, while it took 75 years for the telephone to reach 100 million users, it was 16 years for mobile phones, 7 years for the World Wide Web, four and a half years for Facebook (Dreischmeier et al. 2015), and only a few weeks for Pokemon GO (Moon 2016). The rapid acceleration of technological diffusion confronts BISE researchers, who usually study technological innovations from the perspective of socio-technical systems (Bostrom and Heinen 1977). Work systems are conceptualized as an interplay of tasks, technologies, and people (vom Brocke and Rosemann 2014), systems “in which human participants and/or machines perform work (processes and activities) using information, technology, and other resources to produce specific products/services for specific internal and/or external customers” (Alter 2013, p. 75).",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1e888131d7848790c05b672b0827abc1f2766189,True
Integrated design and operation management for enterprise systems,"Enterprise is a mini social-technical-ecological system in that it consists of humans, equipment and machines, and it has a location or site. Its structure follows the substanceinfrastructure (S-I) framework (Zhang and Wang 2016; Zhang and van Luttervelt 2011). There are two types of the S-I framework: the substance drives the infrastructure (Type I) and the infrastructure drives the substance (Type II). The enterprise system belongs to Type II. For instance, to a manufacturing system, the substance refers to goods made of materials, and the infrastructure refers to humans and machines, which produce and deliver goods to customers in response to their demands. To a service system (Wang et al. 2014), the substance refers to data (knowledge and information) (Zhang 1994) or signals or humans, and the infrastructure refers to humans and machines, which generate data, produce signals, or offer services to customers in accordance with their demands. Enterprise is a dynamic system, and it changes in its state and/or structure with respect to time, location, and/or event, and both the substance and infrastructure may change. A change on the part of the structure and/or state, say A, always has a reason or reasons, and this change is further associated with the change of another part of the structure and/or state of the system, say B; B is an independent variable and A is a dependent variable in this case (Zhang et al. 2005). The knowledge that governs the relation of A and B is called principle (Zhang et al. 2005; Zhang and Wang 2016). For instance, B is the force (F) applied on a block and A is the acceleration (a) of the block system, and the knowledge that governs the relation of A and B, in this case, is the Newton’s second law, that is, F = ma, where m is the mass of the block system. A care must be taken that the principle (knowledge) may be hidden or unfolded in data or big data but a correspondence relation of A and B can be built using various machine learning methods, e.g., Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (Zhao and Zhang 2017), various deep learning methods (Zhang et al. 2018), etc. The independent variable is a function of time, location, and/or event, so is the dependable variable, and thus the whole system changes with respect to time, location, and/or event. Design of an enterprise system means to determine its structure (infrastructure and substance) in response to a need or demand in a context (Zhang and Wang 2016). For instance, in response to the need of charging to electric vehicles, a new enterprise idea, the electric charge station enterprise, emerges. To this new enterprise, one needs to determine the charging equipment, number of workers, and so on, which makes sense to the design of an enterprise (Zhang and Wang 2016). Construction of an enterprise follows its design. Design and construction are processes, so it makes sense to say about their management. A good practice of the management of design and construction thus results in a good structure.

Risk management framework for information systems and organizations:,"This publication provides guidelines for applying the Risk Management Framework (RMF) to information systems and organizations. The RMF includes a disciplined, structured, and flexible process for organizational asset valuation; security and privacy control selection, implementation, and assessment; system and control authorizations; and continuous monitoring. It also includes enterprise-level activities to help better prepare organizations to execute the RMF at the system level. The RMF promotes the concept of near real-time risk management and ongoing system authorization through the implementation of continuous monitoring processes; provides senior leaders and executives with the necessary information to make cost-effective, risk management decisions about the systems supporting their missions and business functions; and integrates security and privacy controls into the system development life cycle. Applying the RMF tasks enterprise-wide helps to link essential risk management processes at the system level to risk management processes at the organization level. In addition, it establishes responsibility and accountability for the security and privacy controls deployed within organizational systems and inherited by those systems. The RMF incorporates concepts from the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity that complement the currently established risk management processes mandated by the Office of Management and Budget and the Federal Information Security Modernization Act.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5271f1c433d538d901a17602aa777c9666163188,True
Are business users social? A design experiment exploring information sharing in enterprise social systems,"In recent years, social technology has changed the ways people collaborate and communicate. With the blurring boundaries between work and personal life, business software vendors have begun to deliberate on the possibilities for enhancing the rather rigid and impersonal structures in enterprise systems (ES) by integrating social features. In doing so, they frequently assume that business users share the same interaction patterns as private users. In this paper, we challenge this belief and explore the factors that stimulate business users to share information in ES environments. By means of a design experiment, we show different use scenarios and explore business users’ attitudes toward open and unconditional information sharing in ES. Our results demonstrate that business users are less ‘social’ and that applying social features in ES is highly context dependent. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations for software vendors and researchers who are interested in the social enhancements of ES.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d183e53d5832a45c016d33658ce043486246ed82,True

Differing Strategies to Meet Information-Sharing Needs: Publicly Supported Community Health Information Exchanges Versus Health Systems' Enterprise Health Information Exchanges.,"POLICY POINTS Community health information exchanges have the characteristics of a public good, and they support population health initiatives at the state and national levels. However, current policy equally incentivizes health systems to create their own information exchanges covering more narrowly defined populations. Noninteroperable electronic health records and vendors' expensive custom interfaces are hindering health information exchanges. Moreover, vendors are imposing the costs of interoperability on health systems and community health information exchanges. Health systems are creating networks of targeted physicians and facilities by funding connections to their own enterprise health information exchanges. These private networks may change referral patterns and foster more integration with outpatient providers. CONTEXT The United States has invested billions of dollars to encourage the adoption of and implement the information technologies necessary for health information exchange (HIE), enabling providers to efficiently and effectively share patient information with other providers. Health care providers now have multiple options for obtaining and sharing patient information. Community HIEs facilitate information sharing for a broad group of providers within a region. Enterprise HIEs are operated by health systems and share information among affiliated hospitals and providers. We sought to identify why hospitals and health systems choose either to participate in community HIEs or to establish enterprise HIEs. METHODS We conducted semistructured interviews with 40 policymakers, community and enterprise HIE leaders, and health care executives from 19 different organizations. Our qualitative analysis used a general inductive and comparative approach to identify factors influencing participation in, and the success of, each approach to HIE. FINDINGS Enterprise HIEs support health systems' strategic goals through the control of an information technology network consisting of desired trading partners. Community HIEs support obtaining patient information from the broadest set of providers, but with more dispersed benefits to all participants, the community, and patients. Although not an either/or decision, community and enterprise HIEs compete for finite organizational resources like time, skilled staff, and money. Both approaches face challenges due to vendor costs and less-than-interoperable technology. CONCLUSIONS Both community and enterprise HIEs support aggregating clinical data and following patients across settings. Although they can be complementary, community and enterprise HIEs nonetheless compete for providers' attention and organizational resources. Health policymakers might try to encourage the type of widespread information exchange pursued by community HIEs, but the business case for enterprise HIEs clearly is stronger. The sustainability of a community HIE, potentially a public good, may necessitate ongoing public funding and supportive regulation.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d00415c5d031d986bb15a5aa589944c653dd2337,True

Information Systems Control: A Review and Framework for Emerging Information Systems Processes,"A major stream of information systems (IS) research examines the topic of control, which focuses on attempts to affect employee behavior as a means to achieve organizational objectives. Despite a rich history of IS control research, approximately 90 percent of the publications focus on only three IS processes: managing information systems development, managing IS outsourcing, and managing security. However, the emergence of new IS processes and technologies with distinct control challenges, such as managing enterprise architecture and managing innovation, highlights a need to consider the wider applicability of past control insights. In this paper, we first integrate existing IS control constructs and relationships into a comprehensive IS control model. Second, we apply this model to emerging IS processes to guide future research and practice. We review 65 influential IS control-related journal papers and identify five control dimensions. We then consolidate these dimensions into a single, integrated model to apply past IS control findings to the challenges of emerging information systems by posing a series of related propositions. With this paper, we position current IS control research to be increasingly applicable and relevant to tomorrow’s emerging IS opportunities and challenges.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/51cbc6f6b3ed2b68b7ecd9b1bf97c31b8abc70e5,True
Optimization of Enterprise Financial Management and Decision-Making Systems Based on Big Data,"Based on information asymmetry theory, principal-agent theory, and risk management theory, this paper analyzes the mechanism of the impact of big data on financial decision-making, analyzing four dimensions: how big data enhances the information base for forecasting, how big data improves the relevance of decision-making, how big data builds new competitive advantages, and how big data promotes dynamic decision-making. Secondly, through the analysis of specific implementation cases of enterprise big data in financial decision-making, we focus on the real problems faced in management and the effect of solving problems through big data platform. The enterprise realizing the integration of business and finance not only can better lead business expansion, but also can improve the management level within the enterprise, which is conducive to the improvement of core competitiveness. The integration of industry and finance is essentially achieved through the application of various financial management modules to the business operations of enterprises, including budget management, capital management, fixed asset management, and financial accounting. If we want to implement the whole process of financial integration, it is impossible to achieve this manually, and we must first build a powerful information system as a guarantee. Under the guidance of theories of information asymmetry, stakeholders, and management information systems, Internet finance enterprises should build their own integrated business finance system based on the demand for business finance integration in the Internet finance industry, to enhance the matching of business finance data of Internet finance enterprises, improve the efficiency of enterprise management, and realize business finance integration. Finally, through the research of this paper, we hope to provide reference for other similar enterprises to apply big data for financial decision-making. Through the application of big data, higher economic benefits are achieved in procurement management, production control, capital budget, and investment decision compared with the previous ones. It is concluded that in the era of big data, massive data can be used to serve enterprise decision-making in depth, which can break the business and financial barriers, improve the efficiency and quality of decision-making, optimize the organizational structure and personnel, and enhance the prediction and early warning capability. The application of big data tools has become the key to assisting financial decision-making and enhancing enterprise value.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0fc70e56305ec208cad24092f2e23b7d62b802e2,True
A Comparative Analysis of Using the Capability Notion for Congruent Business and Information Systems Engineering,"The notion of capability has been gaining a growing attention in the business and information system (IS) engineering community due to a number of reasons: it facilitates focus on business investments, it can be used as a baseline for business planning, and it directly leads to service specification and design.

The Power of Noise: Redefining Retrieval for RAG Systems,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a method to extend beyond the pre-trained knowledge of Large Language Models by augmenting the original prompt with relevant passages or documents retrieved by an Information Retrieval (IR) system. RAG has become increasingly important for Generative AI solutions, especially in enterprise settings or in any domain in which knowledge is constantly refreshed and cannot be memorized in the LLM. We argue here that the retrieval component of RAG systems, be it dense or sparse, deserves increased attention from the research community, and accordingly, we conduct the first comprehensive and systematic examination of the retrieval strategy of RAG systems. We focus, in particular, on the type of passages IR systems within a RAG solution should retrieve. Our analysis considers multiple factors, such as the relevance of the passages included in the prompt context, their position, and their number. One counter-intuitive finding of this work is that the retriever's highest-scoring documents that are not directly relevant to the query (e.g., do not contain the answer) negatively impact the effectiveness of the LLM. Even more surprising, we discovered that adding random documents in the prompt improves the LLM accuracy by up to 35%. These results highlight the need to investigate the appropriate strategies when integrating retrieval with LLMs, thereby laying the groundwork for future research in this area.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/77179e5ff669452b9bea479a4236a6e2009ee422,True

Influential Characteristics of Enterprise Information System User Interfaces,"ABSTRACT End-user acceptance is considered as a significant factor influencing the success of enterprise information system (EIS) implementations and operations. This study conceptualizes three aspects of EIS user interfaces (UIs), namely information overload, control familiarity, and UI fit, and proposes a model to understand their effect on two major factors that are considered to influence the end-user acceptance of these systems: EIS end user’s performance expectancy and effort expectancy. We developed a theoretical model and multiitem scales for the proposed EIS UI characteristics and tested the model empirically with data from a survey performed with a sample 98 EIS end users. The results from our test provide evidence for the key role that EIS UI design plays in the end user’s performance and effort expectancy.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8a4c121c8c083a5ce07b7221b406319f4bbf588e,True
Policy-Level Specifications in REA Enterprise Information Systems,"The Resource‐Event‐Agent (REA) enterprise model is a widely accepted framework for the design of the accountability infrastructure of enterprise information systems.

We first explore two distinctive semantic abstractions essential to policy‐level specifications: typification and grouping. The typification abstraction links instances of an object class to concepts for which they are concrete realizations, while the grouping abstraction aggregates objects into collections. We next present a number of patterns for the semantic modeling of policies.

ANALYSIS OF CABLE NETWORK READINESS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING INFORMATION SYSTEMS AT THE FACULTY OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING,"With the rapid advancement of information and communication technology, organizations increasingly adopt integrated systems to enhance efficiency and productivity. One widely adopted technology is Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), a comprehensive management system that integrates various business functions, including finance, manufacturing, inventory, and human resources. Implementing an ERP system requires a robust network infrastructure, particularly in terms of quality of service (quality of service). This study aims to evaluate the readiness of the cable network infrastructure across three buildings at the Faculty of Industrial Engineering, Telkom University, to implement an Odoo-based ERP system. The research employs the Network Development Life Cycle (NDLC) methodology, focusing on crucial quality of service parameters such as throughput, delay, jitter, and packet loss. Data were collected through observations, interviews, and network analysis using Wireshark, with tests conducted at different times (low, peak, and intermediate). The results show that the TULT Building, Mangudu Building, and Building B Cacuk networks are generally prepared for ERP implementation. For instance, in the TULT Building, the average throughput without filters at low, peak, and intermediate times was 45.296 Kbps, 50.923 Kbps, and 61.399 Kbps, respectively. Packet loss averaged 0.56%, 0.50%, and 0.65% without filters. Despite jitter values ranging from 103.73 ms to 582.40 ms, below the TIPHON standard, the ERP system remains functional as it is not highly sensitive. The study concludes that the existing network infrastructure is sufficient mainly for the Odoo-based ERP implementation, with recommendations for further improvements to address jitter issues.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f214ad2db2884e15ab2e49e6c9b783f960e669b9,True
A Decision-Making Model With Intuitionistic Fuzzy Information for Selection of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems,"Involvement of small and medium-scale enterprises is important for developing countries like India. Henceforth, enhancing their competency with the adoption of a suitable enterprise resource planning system (ERPS) is a vital way to enhance their competitiveness. The choice of an appropriate ERPS can be considered as a complex multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem where several alternatives (ERPS packages) are assessed based on certain types of characteristics, namely domain knowledge of the supplier, system reliability, service and support, functionality, compatibility, information security, cross-module integration, etc. One critical issue associated with the evaluation of ERPSs is the handling of uncertain information. In this article, we first develop a new methodology to resolve the issue of MCDM problems. In this methodology, the weights of decision experts are systematically calculated with the extended variance approach on intuitionistic fuzzy sets. For calculating the criteria weights, an optimization model based on cross-entropy is proposed, and for the aggregation of the criteria values, a new model called intuitionistic fuzzy improved measurement alternatives and ranking based on the compromise solution is developed, which allows both the vector and linear normalizations and having the advantages of comprising two kinds of aggregation models. Next, an ERPS cloud vendor assessment problem is deliberated with three alternatives (A1: Systems, Applications, and Products (SAP), A2: Oracle Corporation, A3: Microsoft Corporation) and 16 criteria to interpret the reasonableness of the introduced framework. According to the outcomes, SAP is the most suitable alternative. Next, a sensitivity analysis is exhibited with diverse parameter values to inspect the permanence of the presented approach. The advantage of the presented approach is discussed with the comparative investigation.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/988d0a0d581ad903897ef85f4d26ab9b13d67a40,True

Mechanisms for successful management of enterprise resource planning from user information processing and system quality perspective,"Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are now ubiquitous in modern organizations. A number of previous studies have focused only on system factors and perceptions, there is a noticeable shortfall in research that concurrently addresses technological factors and human roles in explaining user satisfaction. This study aimed to identify these variables from the perspectives of information systems, technology, and human participation, thereby addressing this knowledge gap. The focus of the study was a large shipbuilding and marine company utilizing an ERP system. The participants, a sample of 234 ERP users, were carefully selected by the company’s executives and practitioners, and data was collected through online questionnaires. They were selected through purposive sampling from among employees who use ERP systems in large-scale shipbuilding and marine engineering companies. The study aimed to clarify the relationships between user satisfaction and perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, system quality, service quality, participation, and information quality. A partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the collected data. The results indicated that perceived ease of use, system quality, service quality, and participation positively influenced user satisfaction, whereas perceived usefulness did not have a significant impact. Interestingly, participation was found to lessen the effects of perceived usefulness on satisfaction. The findings of this study suggest that to enhance ERP user satisfaction, managers should strive to make the ERP system easy-to-use and stable, encourage employee participation in the decision-making process, and bolster the role of the support team. It should be noted, however, that the study has limitations as it did not consider all possible factors, such as training and support. Future research should take a broader view of the variables involved in the operation of an enterprise-wide information system.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d54ee6c7d8fbef532a1cdb557ffe1d52f70e1be5,True
Enhancing PLS-SEM-Enabled Research with ANN and IPMA: Research Study of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems’ Acceptance Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM),"PLS-SEM has been used recently more and more often in studies researching critical factors influencing the acceptance and use of information systems, especially when the technology acceptance model (TAM) is implemented. TAM has proved to be the most promising model for researching different viewpoints regarding information technologies, tools/applications, and the acceptance and use of information systems by the employees who act as the end-users in companies. However, the use of advanced PLS-SEM techniques for testing the extended TAM research models for the acceptance of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems is scarce. The present research aims to fill this gap and aims to show how PLS-SEM results can be enhanced by advanced techniques: artificial neural network analysis (ANN) and Importance–Performance Matrix Analysis (IPMA). ANN was used in this research study to overcome the limitations of PLS-SEM regarding the linear relationships in the model. IPMA was used in evaluating the importance and performance of factors/drivers in the SEM. From the methodological point of view, results show that the research approach with ANN artificial intelligence complements the results of PLS-SEM while allowing the capture of nonlinear relationships between the variables of the model and the determination of the relative importance of each factor studied. On other hand, IPMA enables the identification of factors with relatively low performance but relatively high importance in shaping dependent variables.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cfb5781b02682bdd49bd367d6e2fc633a95ba128,True
The Adoption of Enterprise Resource Planning and Business Intelligence Systems in Small and Medium Enterprises: A Conceptual Framework,"The widespread globalism of services and the fast technological progress brought about by IT have made organizations today competitive in offering new products and services. One of the highlighted innovations is the enterprise resource planning and business intelligence system (ERPB), which has captivated the interest of industry analysts and policymakers due to its potential to provide more intellectual information for decision making and ensure its continuity. Firms must use ERPBI appropriately to flourish, as its misuse leads to failure. Even though research has focused on the factors influencing ERPBI adoption, most studies have ignored many factors that influenced the behavioral intention to adopt variable that significantly affects the adoption and use of technology. Ensuring the proper adoption of ERPBI is critical to corporate success. If ERPBI is misused, this will not serve its objective. Although a few studies have studied factors affecting the success of ERPBI adoption, the majority have failed to discover drivers of continuity and sustainability. This article proposed a conceptual framework for ERPBI adoption using the TOE and UTAUT models. Four main hypotheses were formulated for the three dimensions of technology, organization, and environment. The proposed framework is vital in adopting the ERPBI and could shape the direction in successfully adopting new technologies in SMEs. This study could fill in the gap in ERPBI research because previous studies have not focused on ERPBI adoption factors, ERPBI adoption, and business continuity.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e73cd143d4e818d622b11f9fa2158f36bc7ddddb,True

Moving enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to the cloud: the challenge of infrastructural embeddedness,"Cloud enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions allow organizations to support and coordinate key business processes by leveraging virtualization. Nevertheless, moving ERPs to the cloud is not straightforward, and organizational cloud ERP initiatives raise multiple concerns. We conducted an in-depth systematic review of relevant research literature and identified six key concerns related to cloud ERP implementation: a) the introduction of new ERP work arrangements, b) the migration of legacy data, c) the assurance of compliance with extant rules and regulations for security, d) the continuous alignment between ERP functionality and business processes, e) the ongoing integration between ERPs and the rest of the organization’s application portfolio, and f) the establishment of adequate reliability levels. The identified concerns are associated with both transition management and operations supported by cloud ERPs. All the identified concerns are also related to the need to achieve infrastructural embeddedness. This need sets ERPs apart from other types of cloud-based applications, such as office automation solutions that do not have as many dependencies and exchanges with other systems and repositories within an organization’s information infrastructure. We argue that the challenge of embeddedness has different implications for organizations of different sizes, and we call for further empirical research.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/506c24c87e086c1c9aa19b07e114e76512fc3a37,True

User Acceptance of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems in Higher Education Institutions: A Conceptual Model,"It has become common practice for higher education institutions (HEIs) to replace existing computer systems, called legacy administrative information systems, with new ones to cope with the continuously changing demands in the context of education. At the top of these systems is enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems that integrate HEIs' business processes, functions, and data to improve their overall productivity and effectiveness. However, many studies on ERP adoption have shown that organizations frequently face several barriers, and the failure rate is high. In addition, various research projects have concluded that, quite often, HEIs do not obtain the expected advantages from the adoption of the ERP system. This research aims to explore the factors that affect the behavioral adoption and acceptance of an ERP system in the context of HEIs. Based on works from literature and authors' observations of the PeopleSoft system (ERP system) implementation at Yanbu University College (YUC) in Yanbu City, Saudi Arabia (SA), a conceptual model of users' acceptance of ERP systems has been proposed. The framework is based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model and is extended with additional constructs.

Enterprise Resource Planning Systems and XBRL Reporting Quality,"Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are indispensable for a majority of larger and midsize firms, and have changed the way accounting information is collected, stored, processed, and disseminated. Although most ERP systems integrate an eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) component in their core modules, little research has examined how ERP systems affect the quality of XBRL filings. Using unique data from branch-level ERP implementation, we find that the degree of ERP adoption among a firm’s branches is negatively associated with the firm’s XBRL filing errors and positively associated with XBRL reporting comparability, which in turn facilitates external users’ access to the firm’s XBRL filings in the SEC’s EDGAR. These results suggest that ERP systems improve XBRL reporting quality.

Developing an ARIS-House-Based Method from Existing Information Systems to Project-Based Enterprise Resource Planning for General Contractor,"In recent years, general contractors in the construction industry have gradually begun to implement a system called enterprise resource planning (ERP). During the ERP implementation process, contractors performed required analyses on daily operation functions demanded by the enterprise. The analyses focused on function mapping to ensure that ERP satisfies all the requirements, including the functions of existing information systems, and meets future requirements. The process of function mapping in the construction industry typically involves a series of lengthy and time-consuming meetings, and face-to-face discussions; systematic analysis procedure was lacking. This research will propose a novel function mapping approach, the Architecture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS)-house-based (AHB) method, to enhance the effectiveness of meetings and improve the efficiency of discussions. In addition, AHB method will use the structure of ARIS-house diagram to guide the function mapping process, streamline existing information systems, meet future requirements, and successfully implement ERP.

Findings of the study depict that all the hypothesized relationships were significant (p<.001) at the 1 % level of significance, implying that there exists a positive effect of the ERP systems on firm performance.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12f6dfcba6462ce45a763092db6ecd9d301dac3f,True
A decision-making framework for evaluating enterprise resource planning systems in a high-tech industry,"ABSTRACT In recent years, the adoption of enterprise resource planning (ERP) is becoming essential for achieving fast and transparent information exchange, avoiding unnecessary waste and maintaining coordination within a firm and among partners in a supply chain. However, the implementation of an ERP system often fails, and one major reason is that the selected ERP system is not suitable for the firm. Therefore, a good evaluation framework for selecting the most appropriate ERP system is necessary. This study proposes a framework, which integrates decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), analytic network process (ANP), VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje in Serbian (VIKOR) and fuzzy set theory, for the evaluation of ERP systems. First, the fuzzy DEMATEL is used to understand the direct and indirect relationships among the criteria. Second, the fuzzy ANP is adopted to calculate the importance weights of the sub-criteria. Finally, the most appropriate ERP system is obtained by the fuzzy VIKOR. The proposed decision-making framework is applied to a firm in the high-tech industry in selecting the most appropriate ERP system. The results show that the proposed framework can help firms evaluate ERP systems effectively by collecting experts’ opinions in an uncertain environment.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a4015f9b23031624ba0dc592bb888aff85ce4ac,True
Enterprise Resource Planning Systems: Digitization of Healthcare Service Quality,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the perception of healthcare professionals in improving the quality of services in healthcare centers by deploying the platform of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). Individual attributes, organizational impression, information, and the system quality of ERP have been used to evaluate the overall influence of integrated planning systems on health care service quality. A mixed methods approach is used to collect and examine data through triangulation. Data for the empirical study was collected from 279 medical professionals of five healthcare organizations operating in the city of Lahore, Pakistan, through a self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics squared multiple correlations and reliability coefficients were used as data analysis tools. Moreover, the goodness of fit test of the structural model was conducted through AMOS 20. All given dimensions of ERP are postulated to have a positive effect on healthcare service quality. The results reveal that the use of an enterprise planning system has a positive impact on individuals, organizational information quality, and system quality in healthcare services. The study further concludes that a well implemented ‘Enterprise Resource Planning System’ results in better system output and enables healthcare professionals to provide better healthcare service quality.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b017a61c6f37303e2a4684808c108644ea71b7b,True
Effect of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems and Forms of Management Control on Firm’s Competitive Advantage,"In the brick of digitalization industry revolution era, this study signifies the pertinent role of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERPs) towards assisting the organization towards attaining the firm’s mission and goal. This study extends the knowledge by exploring the relationship between ERPs and management control (MC), which in turn enhances firm’s competitive advantage. Realizing the limited empirical work on ERPs from management accounting and control perspective, the discussion would be drawn from business stakeholder’s perspective, instead of from information technology standpoint. The study views ERPs as an important resource in creating the capability to control the business operations and combination of both factors creates the firm’s competitive advantage. Survey questionnaires were administered via email to 972 randomly selected manufacturing firms listed in Federation of Malaysian Manufacturer Directory. Based on the 114 usable responses, the data was analyzed using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach through partial least square (PLS) software. The findings provide empirical evidence on the significance of ERPs in determining firm’s MC approaches, both technocratic and socio-ideological forms of control. Evidently, these variables do associate positively with competitive advantage. Additionally, the analysis demonstrates that only technocratic form of MC mediates the relationship between ERPs and competitive advantage, but not for socio-ideological control. These findings provide an insight on the relationship among ERPs, form of MC and firm’s competitive advantage, which may be an input for businesses in facing the industrial digitalization era.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc64add806952d12ccae223aa233c31bd5d545b4,True

Conceptual model of enterprise resource planning and business intelligence systems usage,"Businesses have invested considerable resources in the usage of enterprise resource planning ERP and business intelligence BI systems. These systems were heavily studied in developed countries while there are a few and narrowly focused studies in developing ones. However, studies on the integration of ERP and BI have not been given enough attention hereafter ERPBI. There are many challenges facing the ERPBI usage in term of the steadily increasing speed with which new technologies are evolving. In addition, there are a number of factors that affecting this usage. Based on the finding of the literature, a model from a critical success factors CSFs perspective that examine the relationship between ERPBI usage and organisational performance is proposed. The conceptual model provides a foundation for more research in the future. The expected results of the study will improve the business outcome and help design strategies based on an investigation between ERPBI usage and organisational performance.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f5051cadf136ab08953ef987c83c17019b99343,True
Do Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERPs) Constrain Real Earnings Management?,"ABSTRACT The examination of the beneficial impact of enterprise resource planning systems (ERPs) on firm performance appears in extensive literature. Prior studies also examine how ERP implementations impact the timeliness of financial information. Few studies, however, address the question of whether the increase in managers' access to accounting data differentially influences managerial behavior. We investigate the association of ERP implementation with managers' flexibility to deviate from normal operating practices to present better financial results. Our findings suggest that after the implementation of an ERP, earnings management through real activities declines. These results particularly indicate that ERP implementations enhance the quality of financial reporting by constraining opportunistic managerial behavior.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d3e2a7111dffa8acd907a03f69ec4d46a5cddceb,True
Information System Assurance for Enterprise Resource Planning Systems: Unique Risk Considerations,"Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems inherently present unique risks due to tightly linked interdependencies of business processes, relational databases, and process reengineering. Knowledge of such risks is important in planning and conducting assurance engagements of the reliability of these complex computer systems. Yet, there is little empirical evidence on this issue. To examine this topic, a semi‐structured interview study was conducted with 30 experienced information systems auditors (from 3 of the Big 5 firms) who specialize in assessing risks for ERP systems. This approach allowed us to obtain detailed information about participants' views and client experiences. The results indicate that the implementation process of ERP systems has an important impact on system reliability. Further, interviewees identified a number of common implementation problems (e.g., improperly trained personnel and inadequate process reengineering efforts) that result in heightened risks. Interviewees also reported ...",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d249e627cc7938671864ca2a5b49031e3b8f5701,True
Measuring Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems Effectiveness in Indonesia,"Refining DeLone and McLean’s (D&M) information system model and technology-organisation-environment (TOE) framework, this research identifies the prominent factors that determine ERP system success. Hypotheses are also drawn based on supporting theories to evaluate the causal relationship between the success determinants. The level of achievement is measured by system quality, information quality, service quality, external quality and top management support, which intermediated by perceived usefulness and user satisfaction towards business benefits. To provide empirical evidence, 86 valid samples out of 156 were collected using a web survey that targeted ERP users in Indonesia. Furthermore, Partial Least Squares–Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) algorithm were applied to check the proposed hypotheses. The results suggest system quality, information quality and service quality significantly affect user satisfaction, whereas they moderately impact on perceived usefulness. Interestingly, external pressures were reported as being the biggest influence on user satisfaction and positively impacted on perceived usefulness. Despite being fairly predictive to perceived usefulness, top management support along with general perceptual factors ultimately promote system success by elevating business benefits.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7ffc23ac15fb6e8199403e756097d226c26e973a,True

Acceptance of homegrown enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in Ethiopia,"In the current competitive global market, organizations are implementing information and communication technology (ICT) that could add value to their products, processes, and satisfaction of their users. The adoption, implementation and use of homegrown enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems is one of these mechanisms being globally used for recording, processing, storing, and exchanging organizational information anytime anywhere. Although organizations have been utilizing ERP systems, the acceptance of homegrown ERP systems is given less attention as compared to commercial off-the shelf (COTS) software. Hence, this research studied factors that determine acceptance of homegrown ERP through the extension of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model. The finding revealed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, competitive advantage, cost effectiveness, and facilitations functions are determinants of homegrown ERP system acceptance in Ethiopia. Moreover, experience and voluntariness are found to be significant moderators of the study.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2c5ec2fd82aa3f2390011945c21f67aacb2b6efb,True
Developing business advantages from the technological possibilities of enterprise information systems,"Organizations are increasingly implementing Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems in particular. Despite the notable studies on the advantages of an EIS, many organizations are not satisfied with the benefits or advantages gained. At the same time, it is assumed that such systems with increasing innovations and technological enhancements would generate abundant business advantages, if organizations exploited these opportunities. The investigation in this work drew on the sociomateriality perspective, using imbrication notion, and focused on a telecomm case study to examine how organizations can exploit the technological possibilities of an EIS to create business benefits. The study findings suggest that business benefits can be achieved when the EIS as a technical system is interwoven with the organizational work in which both dynamically change in practice (not from the technical features of the system), when the system provides interesting and beneficial technological possibilities that attract organizations, and when the firm has the organizational capabilities to translate these possibilities into real business benefits.",ENT,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1ebea3892fe4de5831efc0830b93899449ec765a,True

Determinants of user satisfaction with financial information systems in the digital transformation era: insights from emerging markets,"Purpose Most of the previous studies agree about the significance of user satisfaction in ensuring the endurance of information systems (ISs). Accordingly, it is crucial to investigate the effect of e-Government systems on individual end-user satisfaction as more and more countries adopt and deploy such Government Financial Management Information Systems (GFMIS) in the era of digital transformation. Because of this, the purpose of this study is to investigate the factors that contribute to the success of GFMIS in Jordan and ultimately the satisfaction of its users. Design/methodology/approach The IS success model developed by DeLone and McLean (2003) serves as the theoretical underpinning for the current research. Adding training quality as a new variable to the proposed model has been found to further increase the satisfaction of GFMIS users. A total of 104 GFMIS users in Jordan provided the data used to verify the model. The partial least squares-structural equation modelling was used to test the hypotheses. Findings The empirical findings indicated that GFMIS user satisfaction is significantly affected by information quality, service quality and perceived usefulness; meanwhile, system quality is only partially supported. The research also showed that the level of satisfaction among Jordanian GFMIS users was related to the quality of training they received. Originality/value This study fills a crucial literature gap by developing a research model that can help improve GFMIS usage towards attaining greater performance amongst government agencies in Jordan.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4acba1f7e7bf1732b72c7dc031f0043c6f1cf1a9,True
Legacy Systems Modernisation for Citizen-Centric Digital Government: A Conceptual Model,"Information technology and communication (ICT) plays an important role as a catalyst for organisational development and innovation. However, old information systems that are known as legacy systems often expose organisations to the risk of business failure. These systems are not only impeding the advancement in technology strategy but also hindering the organisations’ business competitiveness. Nevertheless, legacy systems are essential in supporting critical functions in organisations including the public sector and could not be scrapped easily. These systems need to be given a new strength through modernisation to continue providing the best service in line with global trends. Modernisation is a complex task that involves several related aspects. In the context of the public sector, legacy systems involve a complicated information relationship, environment, and culture, while ensuring the citizens are of high priority. The implementation of a digital government represents the transformation of the public service delivery to the citizens that emphasises a citizen-centric design. This study, therefore, aims to address this concern by reviewing the factors involved and suggesting a guideline in the form of a conceptual model to assist in the modernisation of legacy systems for a citizen-centric digital government. Data from the theoretical study were analysed using content analysis. The results show that the legacy systems’ modernisation comprised four main aspects, namely human, process, product, and organisation aspects, with related factors and elements. This model contributes as a reference for the public sector and provides overall guidance in performing legacy systems modernisation.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6220994ce3ae6f4cce833d7f466198784004b564,True

Factors influencing village information systems adoption in Indonesia: A qualitative study,"Like other developing countries, the Indonesian government is pursuing digital transformation to achieve good governance at the central and micro levels. One of the strategies for achieving digital government transformation at the micro level is implementing village information systems (VIS), information systems that village officials manage. Unfortunately, not all villages in Indonesia are thriving in adopting VIS. Therefore, this study aims to answer an overarching puzzle: Why did some village governments successfully adopt VIS while others failed? Using a case‐study approach to VIS adoption in Gunungkidul Regency, Indonesia, this study fills the gap in the literature from the technological‐organizational–environmental perspective that affects e‐government adoption at the village government level. We found four main factors that influence the success or failure of village information systems adoption: (1) VIS interoperability (technology context), (2) the workload of village officers (organizational context), (3) the role of civil society, and (4) the role of a vendor (environmental context). This research enriches the literature by identifying these four factors within the TOE framework, still rarely present in e‐government adoption studies, especially in the context of village governments in developing countries. This research has practical implications for the successful adoption of VIS as a village government effort to gain data sovereignty.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/faaa1b2f60c6799868a0fa0f4d238a00d4ddf680,True
Privacy concerns and digital government: exploring citizen willingness to adopt the COVIDSafe app,"ABSTRACT Contact tracing is a key public health intervention during the coronavirus pandemic. While government contact tracing apps (e.g., COVIDSafe) may enforce personal information protection, privacy concerns remain among citizens. To date, few studies have investigated the adoption of contact tracing technology and corresponding citizen information privacy concerns. To address this gap, we propose a research model to explore the impact of individual privacy concerns, trust, and risk perceptions on citizen’s willingness to download a federal contact tracing app. To test the model, we administer a survey to Australian citizens to assess their perceptions of the government’s “COVIDSafe” app. The results of this study indicate that relative advantage, compatibility and trusting beliefs increase adoption intentions.

Digital Government and the Circular Economy: Towards an Analytical Framework,"Circular economy is high on the political agenda, with governments at all levels setting ambitious goals to move away from traditional linear production models, where goods are used and disposed as waste, towards a future with less use of virgin raw materials, and where valuable materials at a product end-of-life are returned as raw materials or in an environmentally-friendly way to the biosphere. While circular economy is gaining a lot of attention on a policy level, the role that digital government can play to facilitate the circular economy transition is largely unexplored. We carry out a review of existing literature in the fields of digital government and Information Systems (IS) to identify the roles played by digital government in the circular economy. Based on an analysis of 54 empirical research articles, we identify foci and gaps in relation to the different types of roles played by government (nodality, authority, treasure, and organization), to stages of the Product Life Cycle (pre-use, in-use, and post-use), and to types of digital technology focused on. Based on these findings, we present an analytical framework to guide future research on digital government in relation to the circular economy, and exemplify the use of the framework drawing on examples from circular economy initiatives in the automotive industry.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/40c646965c3d15ed5804274c3b8f65614bf20dd5,True
Access to Government Information and Inclusive Stewardship of North America’s Archaeological Heritage,": The Digital Index of North American Archaeology (DINAA) gazetteer works to enrich understanding of the human presence on the landscape of North America since the late Pleistocene by connecting hundreds of thousands of archaeological and historical sites to related tribal and other government bodies, museum, library, archive, and scientific datasets, as well as repositories of scientific literature. This chapter explores how open data, if applied appropriately in partnership with tribal authorities and experts, can help serve the interests of Indigenous peoples. Currently, Native American tribes face daunting obstacles in obtaining data documenting ancestral territories. Relevant data are often siloed within opaque and under-resourced government systems. DINAA makes key descriptive information about North America’s rich cultural heritage available for inspection, evaluation, and use by descendant communities, historically marginalized from administrative and political processes. This “open government” focus helps make cultural heritage management more accountable to wider constituencies. Making these data linked and accessible can be part of larger efforts to enable sovereign tribal nations to effectively manage and protect their ancestral cultural heritage.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9e3b8a2256ce3882c37467e024f91b70914fdc8d,False
"Open government, civic tech and digital platforms in Latin America: A governance study of Montevideo's urban app ‘Por Mi Barrio’","Digital technologies have a recognised potential to build more efficient, credible, and innovative public institutions in Latin America. Despite progress, digital transformation in Latin American governments remains limited. In this work, we explore a peculiar yet largely understudied opportunity in the region: pursuing digital government transformation as a collaborative process between the government and civil society organisations. To do so, we draw from information systems research on digital government and platforms for development, complemented with governance theory from political science and conduct an interpretive in‐depth case study of an urban reporting platform in Montevideo called ‘Por Mi Barrio’. The study reveals three mutually reinforced orders of governance in the trajectory of the project and explain how the collaboration unfolded over time: (i) a technical decision to use open platform architectures; (ii) the negotiation of formal and informal rules to make the project thrive and (iii) a shared, long‐term ideology around the value of open technologies and technical sovereignty grounded in years of political history.

Trustworthiness of digital government services: deriving a comprehensive theory through interpretive structural modelling,"ABSTRACT Having its origin in public administration, trustworthiness is a significant concept in digital government research, influencing the relationships between citizens and governments. However, the interrelationships between the facets of trustworthiness are given inadequate attention. Therefore, the aim of this research was to develop a theory detailing the factors affecting citizens’ perceptions of e-government trustworthiness. A comprehensive review of public administration and information systems literature highlighted 20 pertinent variables. The interrelationships of these variables were identified and categorized according to their driving and dependence power by employing interpretive structural modelling.

Digital government and geographic information systems,"The focus of this chapter is to examine how government agencies are deploying geographic information systems (GIS) to enhance the delivery of digital government. We will explain how critical technological advances are enabling government agencies to use GIS in web-based applications In addition, we will illustrate the approaches that state and local governments in the United States are taking to deploy GIS for e-government applications using examples from Indianapolis, Indiana, Tucson, Arizona, Washington D. C. and the State of Oregon's Department of Environmental Protection. While these examples greatly improve service delivery performance and enhance public decision-making, we raise the issue that e-government GIS applications may be more broadly deployed in organizations that are better adept at dealing with the managerial and technical issues related to using GIS.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/56a290ab8a36d4650993b3d6d63f59a5e1b2d618,True

Technological Revolution in the Field: Green Development of Chinese Agriculture Driven by Digital Information Technology (DIT),"According to the Plan for Rural Development of Digital Agriculture (2019–2025) ,accelerated integration of digital technologies and agriculture is crucial to promoting high-quality agriculture in China. The application of DIT in agricultural activities will not only help improve the efficiency of agricultural production, but also promote the green development of agriculture and the achievement of the Dual Carbon Target (DCT). In order to further clarify the comprehensive effects of the application of DIT in agricultural systems and provide routes for government decision-makers to assist in reducing agricultural emissions by DIT, this paper adopts the logical deductive method and starts with the application status to draw out the specific paths of low-carbon transformation in DIT-driven agriculture, while further discussing the potential issues in the process and corresponding solutions. DIT is a double-edged sword. It can promote the green and low-carbon transformation of agriculture by implementing precision operation, environmental monitoring, optimizing carbon emission accounting, and supervising the carbon market. However, at the same time, it may face problems such as unbalanced rural development and excessive financialization of the carbon market. Therefore, we should be optimistic but cautious about the application of DIT in reducing agricultural emissions. We can address potential problems by strengthening government-led investment, broadening channels for capital investment, strengthening skills training for farmers, and enhancing the regulation of trading in carbon sink markets.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/604b4ad555dbdfa58929580d7fee19f76e1ce847,False
"Interoperability, Trust Based Information Sharing Protocol and Security: Digital Government Key Issues","Improved interoperability between public and private organizations is of key significance to make digital government newest triumphant. Digital Government interoperability, information sharing protocol and security are measured the key issue for achieving a refined stage of digital government. Flawless interoperability is essential to share the information between diverse and merely dispersed organisations in several network environments by using computer based tools. Digital government must ensure security for its information systems, including computers and networks for providing better service to the citizens. Governments around the world are increasingly revolving to information sharing and integration for solving problems in programs and policy areas. Evils of global worry such as syndrome discovery and manage, terror campaign, immigration and border control, prohibited drug trafficking, and more demand information sharing, harmonization and cooperation amid government agencies within a country and across national borders. A number of daunting challenges survive to the progress of an efficient information sharing protocol. A secure and trusted information-sharing protocol is required to enable users to interact and share information easily and perfectly across many diverse networks and databases globally. This article presents (1) literature review of digital government security and interoperability and, (2) key research issue trust based information sharing protocol for seamless interoperability among diverse government organizations or agencies around the world. While trust-based information access is well studied in the literature, presented secure information sharing technologies and protocols cannot offer enough incentives for government agencies to share information amid them without harming their own national interest. To overcome the drawbacks of the exiting technology, an innovative and proficient trust-based security protocol is proposed in this article for sharing of top secret information amid government intelligence agencies globally. The trust protocol intended assures the enhanced interoperability of any modern digital government by sharing secure and updated information among government intelligence agencies to avoid any threatening deeds.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/efc1232f969b3ac46aac00c1d3c7dd31f592af94,True
An attempt to understand complexity in a government digital transformation project,"Digital transformation projects will become one of the dominating tools for mastering digital transformation in governments. Studies show that such projects are complex undertakings and increasingly difficult to manage. The purpose of the paper is to provide a better understanding of the factors that cause complexity in government digital transformation projects. The authors use an in-depth case study approach to investigate factors of complexity in an ongoing digital transformation project. The results indicate that complexity in this project is rooted in dynamic relationships between multiple dimensions of organization, technologies, and innovation.

Ethical Issues and Citizen Rights in the Era of Digital Government Surveillance,"Government information systems are big business (costing over 1 per cent of GDP a year). They are critical to all aspects of public policy and governmental operations. Governments spend billions on them for instance, the UK alone commits £14 billion a year to public sector IT operations. Yet governments do not generally develop or run their own systems, instead relying on private sector computer services providers to run large, long-run contracts to provide IT. Some of the biggest companies in the world (IBM, EDS, Lockheed Martin, etc) have made this a core market. The book shows how governments in some countries (the USA, Canada and Netherlands) have maintained much more effective policies than others (in the UK, Japan and Australia). It shows how public managers need to retain and develop their own IT expertise and to carefully maintain well-contested markets if they are to deliver value for money in their dealings with the very powerful global IT industry. This book describes how a critical aspect of the modern state is managed, or in some cases mismanaged.

How does digital payment transform society as a cashless society? An empirical study in the developing economy,"Purpose After analyzing these uncountable benefits of digital or cashless payment, many European countries like Sweden, Finland and Canada has been trying to convert their payment system into cashless. Following these developed countries, the Bangladesh Government has taken a decision to transfer society as a cashless society by using information technologies for adopting the fourth industrial revolution over the world. Digital payment system is among the various options available for transforming a cashless society. First, this empirical study presents demographic information and digital payment characteristics on the basis of income levels. This study identifies influential factors of adopting digital payment systems. Finally, this study aims to justify how digital payments transform the Bangladeshi economy into a cashless society in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach The study was administered to a sample of 1,000 Bangladeshi customers who had engaged in online banking transactions for the purpose of acquiring items and services through both social media platforms in Google Form format and face-to-face interactions in hard copy format. Among these, 647 questions were deemed usable and were used for data analysis, where the response rate was 68%. The SmartPLS is used to create and validate the structural equation modeling model presented for the research, as well as to evaluate the hypothesized correlations between the different constructs. Findings This cross-sectional study conducted the extended technology acceptance model (TAM) with perceived security (PS) and personal innovation (PI) variables to identify the influencing adoption factors of digital payment systems. This study finds that perceived ease of use, PI and perceived usefulness have a favorable impact on individuals’ attitudes toward adopting digital payment methods (DPMs). The study also indicated that PS did not influence negatively the adoption of digital payment system. Besides this, the adoption of digital payment will help to transform society into a cashless society in the future. Research limitations/implications Increasingly prevalent across the nation. Several variables are required to facilitate the transition toward a cashless society. This study exclusively focuses on DPMs. Additionally, the data has been obtained exclusively from a single urban area. The adoption of DPMs has become increasingly prevalent across the nation. Practical implications This study would help policymakers, marketers and bankers understand which factors affect digital payment infrastructure expansion. So, they can produce digital payment apps that are compatible with different devices, have fast transactions, are user-friendly, easy to use and highly secure to maintain good attitudes toward digital payment systems. Social implications Few studies have examined how DPMs affect cashless societies in developing countries like Bangladesh. According to researchers, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to explore how digital payments affect cashless society in Bangladesh and raise awareness about it.

A strategic framework for digital preservation in the context of e-government in Botswana public service,"The purpose of the study was to assess the digital preservation capability maturity readiness in the context of e-government in Botswana Public Service with a view to developing a strategic framework that ensures digital continuity. The study adopted a pragmatic paradigm and case study which were deployed in each of the six selected ministries as a unit of analysis. The target population was 102 respondents from six key purposively sampled ministries. Seventy-nine questionnaires were distributed, of which 55 were completed and returned. Interviews were conducted with 21 staff being senior managers, managers for human resources and administration, heads of divisions for records management units, archives unit, ICT managers and senior records managers. Formal participatory observations of documents were conducted. The study’s findings showed that the Botswana public service has no unified national information systems to manage public sector records, which led to some ministries adopting their own electronic records management systems. Currently, few ministries have implemented the electronic records management system and most digital records are not preserved due to lack of preservation guidelines and strategies. In that regard, the study developed a strategic framework to safeguard digital continuity and make sure that e-government is sustained for the benefit of an open government and increased participatory citizenry.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1401dd4555c7bf85f6f7554dcec87dde31c8f6fc,True

Information Control and Public Support for Social Credit Systems in China,"Critics see China’s social credit system (SCS) as a tool of surveillance and repression. Yet opinion surveys in China find considerable public support for the SCS. We explain this puzzle by focusing on citizens’ lack of knowledge regarding the repressive nature of digital surveillance in dictatorships, which can be attributed to (1) invisible and targeted repression associated with digital surveillance and (2) government propaganda and censorship further concealing its repressive potential. A field survey experiment on 750 college students in three Chinese regions shows that revealing the SCS’s repressive potential significantly reduces support for the system, but emphasizing its social-order-maintenance function does not increase support. Observational evidence from the field survey and a nationwide survey of 2,028 Chinese netizens show that the support is higher if citizens knew about the SCS through state media.

Meningkatkan Transparansi dan Akuntabilitas Pemerintah Melalui Teknologi Digital dan Partisipasi Publik dalam Upaya Pemberantasan Korupsi,"Corruption is one of the biggest challenges faced by many countries, including Indonesia. Corrupt practices not only harm the state’s finances but also erode public trust in the government. This study aims to explore how digital technology and public participation can be effectively used to enhance government transparency and accountability in efforts to combat corruption. This research employs a descriptive qualitative method with a literature review and document analysis approach. Data is collected from various relevant literature sources and official documents to analyze the use of digital technology and public participation in enhancing government transparency and accountability in anti-corruption efforts. The results show that digital technologies, such as e-government, e-procurement, blockchain, big data analytics, open data, whistleblowing systems, and digital payment systems, can facilitate broader and faster access to information and increase public participation in government oversight. Public participation, through active involvement in reporting and monitoring, can raise public awareness of corruption issues and strengthen anti-corruption efforts. This study concludes that the combination of digital technology and public participation has great potential to create a more transparent and accountable government. Recommendations include the development of better technological infrastructure, increased digital literacy among the public, and the promotion of public participation in oversight processes.

Information Technology/Systems Adoption in the Public Sector: Evidence From the Illinois Department of Transportation,"State government has been moving from manual and paper-based processes to digital services. However, digital divide, declining trust in technology, and low IT/IS adoption rates by public sector employees are important challenges for successful delivery of e-government services to citizens. Previous studies in the area of IT/IS adoption and e-government have mainly focused on citizens. This paper examines IT/IS adoption by employees rather than citizens and the focus is on non-market environment and state government agencies. A research model has been proposed based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and technology acceptance model (TAM) which has been extended to include digital divide related constructs and trust in technology. To test the proposed model, a survey was conducted among early adopters of Office 365 at Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) in Springfield and Chicago.

Open government data: A systematic literature review of empirical research,"Open government data (OGD) holds great potential for firms and the digital economy as a whole and has attracted increasing interest in research and practice in recent years. Governments and organizations worldwide are struggling in exploiting the full potential of OGD and require a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon. Although scientific debates in OGD research are intense and heterogeneous, the field lacks theoretical integration of OGD topics and their systematic consideration in the context of the digital economy. In addition, OGD has been widely neglected by information systems (IS) research, which promises great potential for advancing our knowledge of the OGD concept and its role in the digital economy. To fill in this gap, this study conducts a systematic literature review of 169 empirical OGD studies. In doing so, we develop a theoretical review framework of Antecedents, Decisions, Outcomes (ADO) to unify and grasp the accumulating isolated evidence on OGD in context of the digital economy and provide a theory-informed research agenda to tap the potential of IS research for OGD.

Building a Secure Platform for Digital Governance Interoperability and Data Exchange Using Blockchain and Deep Learning-Based Frameworks,"A secured platform is a critical component of digital governance, as it helps to ensure the privacy, security, and reliability of the electronic platforms and systems used to manage and deliver public services. Interoperability and data exchange are essential for digital governance, as they enable different government agencies and departments to share data, information, and resources seamlessly, regardless of the platforms and technologies they use. In this paper, we build a secure platform to enhance the trustworthiness of digital governance interoperability and data exchange using blockchain and deep learning-based frameworks. Initially, an optimal blockchain leveraging approach is designed using the bonobo optimization algorithm to authenticate data generated from smart city environments. Furthermore, we introduce the integration of a lightweight Feistel structure with optimal operations to enhance privacy preservation. This integration provides two levels of security and ensures interoperability and double-secured data exchange in digital governance systems. In addition, we utilize a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model to detect and prevent intrusions such as fraud/corruption in the smart city data. This approach enhances transparency and accountability in accessing the data and shows its predominance over other cutting-edge techniques on two benchmark datasets, BoT-IoT and ToN-IoT. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the framework in real-time scenarios has been demonstrated through two case studies. Overall, our proposed framework provides a trustworthy platform for digital governance, interoperability, and data exchange, addressing the challenges of privacy, security, and reliability in managing and delivering public services.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/56b13859467958af4d930e6d3e8cf48f9b25fd39,True

Mastering Electronic Government in the Digital Age,"The ultimate goal of electronic government (e-government) is to offer the increased portfolio of public services to citizens in a cost-effective manner. Most governments make tremendous efforts to deliver the online services to citizens (Roy, Chartier, Crete, & Poulin, 2015). The operation of information and communications technology (ICT) has been the major development of e-government in the past decade (Reddick & Anthopoulos, 2014). ICT has altered public administration by transforming the internal processes and external interactions (Meijer & Bekkers, 2015). E-government services must be redesigned to ensure that the benefits of ICT systems are completely employed (Kasemsap, 2016). The most significant role of ICT is to drive the organizational innovation through information systems and solve the crucial problems that the government cannot solve on its own (Sindelar, Mintz, & Hughes, 2010). E-government has emerged as an effective method of delivering government services to citizens (Weerakkody, Dwivedi, & Kurunananda, 2009). The diffusion of e-government is an international phenomenon (Carter & Weerakkody, 2008). As an integral part of administration modernization (Stier, 2015), e-government is one of the most important ways to bridge the digital platform in developing countries (Venkatesh, Sykes, & Venkatraman, 2014), acts as an effective exploration of government innovation (Wu & Guo, 2015), and can improve the government performance and create the new public value for citizens and businesses (Wang, 2014). The success of e-government system lies with its cost savings in implementation, adoption, benefits provided to the recipients of the system, and associated risks in operating the system (Weerakkody, Irani, Lee, Osman, & Hindi, 2015). This article aims to bridge the gap in the literature on the thorough literature consolidation of e-government.

This study investigates how national politics affects IT investment profiles in U.S. federal agencies. Drawing on a range of literature from the political science, public administration, and information systems (IS) disciplines, we hypothesize that a federal agency’s capacity-building IT investments are associated with (i) legislative approval for the chief executive, (ii) government dividedness, and (iii) the agency’s ideological characteristic. With a panel data set from 135 federal agencies and bureaus in 2003–2016, our empirical analyses produce several intriguing findings. For instance, when the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives are controlled by the President’s ruling party, federal agencies are predicted...",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5f6e08f71df7e12151e6e1982fabe3810eb24b01,True
"A Comprehensive, Longitudinal Study of Government DNS Deployment at Global Scale","Within the Domain Name System (DNS), government domains form a particularly valuable part of the names-pace, representing trusted sources of information, vital services, and gateways for government personnel to engage in their duties. As the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded, governments’ digital resources have become increasingly important to provide support to populations largely in isolation. The accessibility of these resources relies largely on the trustworthiness of the domains that represent them. In this paper, we conduct an extensive measurement study focused on the availability and legitimacy of DNS records in the authoritative nameservers of government domains for over 190 countries. Our measurements reveal that thousands of domains do not use replicated authoritative name-servers, as well as a substantial increase in the trend of more domains relying on a single third-party DNS services provider. We also find more than 1,000 domains vulnerable to hijacking due to defective delegations. Our work shows that although robust overall, the deployments of authoritative nameservers in government domains still contain a non-trivial number of configurations that do not meet RFC requirements, leading to poor performance and reduced reliability that may leave domains vulnerable to hijacking.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22d40857bace19f9f2fcc2bdeb1ea9d49ab1352d,False
"Citizens’ Trust in Open Government Data: A Quantitative Study about the Effects of Data Quality, System Quality and Service Quality","Previous research assumes that poor quality of Open Government Data (OGD), OGD portals, and the services provided for OGD may result in reduced trust of citizens in OGD. However, studies that empirically test this assumption are scarce. Using the Information Systems (IS) Success Model as a theoretical basis, this study aims to examine the effects of data quality, system quality, and service quality on citizens’ trust in OGD. We used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the 200 responses to our online questionnaire. We found that trust in OGD can be predicted by citizens’ perceptions of OGD system quality and service quality. Furthermore, citizens’ perception of service quality positively influences their perceptions of data and system quality, whereas citizens’ perception of system quality positively influences their perception of data quality. This study is among the first that quantitatively examines the effects of data quality, service quality, and system quality on citizen's trust in OGD. It contributes to the scientific literature by providing an operationalization of elements of the IS Success Model in the context of OGD and by developing and applying a model of factors influencing citizen's trust in OGD. While previous research finds that perceived data quality is the most crucial driver for trust in OGD, our study finds that citizens’ perception of OGD service quality is a more important driver for trust in OGD. With regard to the practical contributions of this study, open data policymakers should be aware that citizens’ perceptions on data quality can be greatly improved when appropriate human services are provided (e.g., designated civil servants offering support or help to data users) in addition to the provision of OGD portal functionalities (e.g., data visualization and comparison tools).",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a12d772cd319af722f6a096cadbeb5c9cce759b4,False
"The Challenges and Opportunities in Adopting AI, IoT and Blockchain Technology in E-Government: A Systematic Literature Review","Over the past decades, governments around the world are implementing a variety of digital solutions in order to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency, and transparency of public services. By using modern information and communication technologies (ICT), citizens are provided with an easier, faster, and more secure way of accessing different types of data. Previous studies on e-government have given important insights into the differences between traditional government systems and digital, e-government. The research was conducted by the systematic literature review guidelines by Kitchenham for papers published between 2016 and 2021 and aims to identify main technologies that are adequate to be used in the context of e-government, by presenting key challenges, as well as opportunities and possible risks of adopting such solutions in public sector services. The results obtained suggest that pairing governance with modern information systems, such as artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT) and blockchain technology, if used properly, can contribute to achieving a higher level of quality of public services and encouragement of citizens' trust and further political activity. Therefore, the present study concluded that there is a significant dependency between a successful e-government implementation and the country's established legal foundations, available technical infrastructures, perceived public trust, as well as social and economical conditions.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/93df80f28f9d6aff2b8300359b4a87ff9b119e07,True
E-Services: Implementation of Digital-Based Public Services in The 4.0 Era,"Globalization has numerous significant impacts that have an effect on people's lives. One of these impacts is the advancement of information and communication technology, which has many promising benefits, such as time efficiency, speedy delivery of information, transparency, and affordability. Technological advancements have infiltrated various sectors, including the government. In today's era of regional autonomy, it is essential to achieve good governance, which is balanced with the use of information and communication technology, commonly referred to as e-government. The use of technology and information indirectly encourages the adoption of electronic-based service systems (e-Services) in government institutions. The development of e-services is a media innovation that supports the provision of excellent services for the community, particularly in rural areas. Furthermore, the development of more varied service features such as letter submissions, complaint services, village information, and administrative procedures is expected to accelerate and facilitate access for service users more efficiently and transparently. This study aims to 1) create a public service e-service design; 2) fulfill the wishes of the community in efficient and effective village government public services; 3) understand the transparency of the village government, which can be accessed digitally.

A Systematic Literature Study to Unravel Transparency Enabled by Open Government Data: The Window Theory,"Abstract The opening of data has been credited for improving transparency and for providing a window on government functioning. Although this relationship is intuitively apparent, it is in fact complex and the mere opening of data might not actually yield transparency. In this paper, a comprehensive model of determinants that enable or impede transparency enabled by open government data and the expected effects have been derived by surveying public administration and information systems literature. Public administration literature tends to be focused on factors such as participation and trust, whereas information systems literature focuses on factors such as user interface, user experience, and data quality. Digital government literature attempts to bridge these elements. The Window Theory is introduced, in order to unify existing models by integrating a broad range of factors within a single model. The Window Theory can be used to develop context-dependent models that are both comprehensive and parsimonious.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9a7cdd8baf02796e11ecdde3d4bee65795f4c55a,True
Crisis as driver of digital transformation? Scottish local governments’ response to COVID-19,"Abstract The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has, from the outset, been characterized by a strong focus on real-time data intelligence and the use of data-driven technologies. Against this backdrop, this article investigates the impacts of the pandemic on Scottish local government’s data practices and, in turn, whether the crisis acted as a driver for digital transformation. Mobilizing the literatures on digital government transformation, and on the impacts of crises on public administrations, the article provides insights into the dynamics of digital transformation during a heightened period of acute demands on the public sector. The research evidences an intensification of public sector data use and sharing in Scottish local authorities, with focus on health-related data and the integration of existing datasets to gather local intelligence. The research reveals significant changes related to the technical and social systems of local government organizations. These include the repurposing and adoption of information systems, the acceleration of inter and intraorganizational data sharing processes, as well as changes in ways of working and in attitudes toward data sharing and collaborations. Drawing on these findings, the article highlights the importance of identifying and articulating specific data needs in relation to concrete policy questions in order to render digital transformation relevant and effective. The article also points to the need of addressing the persistent systemic challenges underlying public sector data engagement through, on one hand, sustained investment in data capabilities and infrastructures and, on the other, support for cross-organizational collaborative spaces and networks.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01f462fe4812591a52b498c6f5aabb73e8b5c9d2,True

Coproduction of Government Services and the New Information Technology: Investigating the Distributional Biases,"This article investigates how communications advances affect citizens’ ability to participate in coproduction of government services. The authors analyze service requests made to the City of Boston during a one-year period from 2010 to 2011 and, using geospatial analysis and negative binomial regression, investigate possible disparities by race, education, and income in making service requests. The findings reveal little concern that 311 systems (nonemergency call centers) may benefit one racial group over another; however, there is some indication that Hispanics may use these systems less as requests move from call centers to the Internet and smartphones. Consistent with prior research, the findings show that poorer neighborhoods are less likely to take advantage of 311 service, with the notable exception of smartphone utilization.

Prescription Tablets in the Digital Age: A Cross-Sectional Study Exploring Patient and Physician Attitudes Toward the Use of Tablets for Clinic-Based Personalized Health Care Information Exchange,"Background To reduce the cost of health care while increasing efficiency and quality, health systems are seeking innovative means to engage and empower patients. Improved use of information technology and electronic health record (EHR) infrastructure is essential, and required for “meaningful use” as mandated by the federal government. Providing personalized health information using tablets at the point of care could enhance the clinical experience and enable efficient collection of patient reported outcome measures to guide clinical decision making. Objective The aim of this study is to explore patient and provider attitudes and interest in a proposed clinic-based tablet system for personal health information exchange. To provide a context to understand patients’ use of tablets during their clinic visit, we also examine patients’ current activities and time spent in the waiting room, and their use of health information resources. Methods Surveys were administered to 84 patients in the waiting room of a community health center affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, MA. This survey included a vignette and illustration describing a proposed tablet-based system in which the patient, upon sign in at the clinic, receives a tablet loaded with personalized information tailored to their specific medical conditions and preferences. Patients were queried about their interest in such a system in comparison to traditional forms of patient education as well as their current health information seeking behaviors and activities and time spent in the waiting room. Interviews with five MGH-affiliated health care providers were conducted to assess their opinions regarding the proposed tablet system. Results The majority (>60%) of patients were “very” or “extremely” interested in the proposed tablet system and thought it would improve their knowledge about their medical condition (60%), assist them in making healthy choices (57%), and help them to feel more comfortable talking with their provider (55%). Patients thought the system would be more motivating, informative, and engaging than traditional printed health education materials. The tablet system was not considered more effective than face-to-face interaction with providers, though 44% thought it would improve their relationship with their physician. Overall, 91% of respondents were willing to learn how to use a tablet and 75% reported being “very” or “extremely” confident they could use one. Four of the five providers believed that the proposed tablet system would improve clinical workflow and patient education. Patients and providers were concerned about privacy and security of data collected using the tablets. Conclusions Both patients and providers were highly amenable to integrating tablets into the clinical experience, and tablets may be useful in improving patients’ health knowledge, the collection of patient reported outcome measures, and improved patient-provider communication. Further research into operationalizing such systems and their validation is necessary before integration into standard clinical practice.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/78f3da7a1dbd6fdbff63e7d9a788c618a9d0b74f,True

Digital Enterprise Architecture for Green SPBE in Indonesia,"SPBE (Electronic Based Government System) is a legal protection as new breakthroughs in the reform of Indonesian government bureaucracy. The issuance of Presidential Regulation (Perpres) 95/2018 concerning SPBE is expected to be a reference for the transformation from e-Government into i-Government (integrated Government). In the meantime, the government through the Ministry of Administrative and Bureaucratic Reform (PANRB) is drafting an academic paper on the SPBE Bill. Of the 10 elements contained in Presidential Regulation (Perpres) 95/2018, the second element namely SPBE architecture is a concept known in the world of Information Systems as Enterprise Architecture.Enterprise architecture is a conceptual framework that describes how an enterprise is constructed by defining its primary components and the relationships among these components. In SPBE, the main component is defined as domain, consisting of 6 parts, namely: business process architecture domain, data and information, infrastructure, SPBE applications, security, and SPBE services. Unfortunately, the Presidential Regulation (Perpres) 95/2018 has not regulated the concept of Digital Enterprise Architecture, since between Enterprise Architecture (EA) and Digital Enterprise Architecture (DEA) are two things that are significantly different. If EA merely focuses on structuring the company based on the main frame of reference, then DEA focuses on utilizing digital repositories to create living documents as according to the EA framework so that they are easily accessed, modified and managed at any time following the company's development. This study created a DEA model for SPBE in Indonesia. The model created is adapted to the SPBE architecture by carrying out the concept of a digital repository. With digital repositories, time efficiency, paper savings and change management will be easier to achieve. The model created in this study is expected to be utilized to make SPBE much more efficient and green-minded.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cd24e1bde0a9131c3808d4c55b216f5e57a8716e,True

"Digital profile: the concept, regulatory mechanisms and enforcement problems","The subject of the research is the legal nature of the digital profile of a citizen, as well as a set of legal norms regulating digital profiling relations in Russia.The comparative method, the method of system analysis, as well as the method of legal modeling are used in the article.The purpose of the article is to confirm or disprove the hypothesis that legal regulation is not the only mechanism for regulating relations in the field of digital profiling.The main results, scope of application. The article studies the phenomenon of digital profile, the main approaches to the digital profiling as well as the circumstances that have caused the state's interest in digital profiling. The creation and operation of a digital profile should be aimed at achieving the goal set out in the legislation. The digital profile is a set of relevant, reliable information about individuals and legal entities formed in the unified identification and authentication system or other information systems of state and local government authorities. The formation of a digital profile is carried out in order to provide data to authorities, legal entities and persons who have requested access to this information through the digital profile infrastructure. The analysis of the Russian legal regulation of relations in the field of digital profiling is presented, the problems of enforcement practice are identified. The analysis revealed the main differences between the digital profile and related categories, including social scoring, the unified population register and others. The comparison of a digital profile with a digital avatar and a digital character was carried out. It is extremely important to pay close attention to the problems of digital profiling both at the level of fundamental and applied scientific research. At the state level, it is important to strategically determine what a digital profile is, as well as formulate the main directions of the digital profiling development, challenges and risks. The importance of the development of digital profiling for unified system of public authorities in the Russian Federation is outlined.Conclusions. The analysis of the emerging practice of digital profiling in contemporary society shows that legal regulation does not always allow us to keep up with the rapidly developing relations in this area. The possibility of using other mechanisms should be considered. The use of mechanisms of regulatory experiments can also be considered as special mechanisms for regulating relations in the field of digital profiling. The goal of the research has been achieved, the legal nature of the digital profile has been revealed, approaches to regulating this phenomenon in the conditions of digital transformation have been proposed.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7a11d80923193fc3fd9bc57c12e30b74dc15cece,True
E-Government and Foreign Direct Investment: Evidence From Chinese Cities,"Along with the rapid development of digital information technology, e-government is of great potential because it is a new form of conducting public administration and a way of demonstrating governmental innovation.

Public Governance in Digital Transformation: from Electronic Document Exchange to Digital Ecosystems,"This article explores the changes arising from the introduction of information and communication technologies in public administration using an institutional approach. Practical examples are used to consider transformations in the way government institutions interact with citizens and organizations, as well as new emerging opportunities in the provision of public and socially important services. The author analyses both the retrospective formation of centralised government information systems in countries that have reached digital maturity, the formation of electronic, digital and smart governments, and the emerging trends of the next round of digital transformation - the development of interstate digital ecosystems and regional digital environments of megacities and urban agglomerations. In particular, the article examines the steps taken by the US government in the early 21st century to establish electronic interaction between government agencies and to create a system for delivering public services that excludes personal contact by citizens and companies. It then identifies technologies that have subsequently enabled other countries to make the transition to fully digital governmental information. A significant innovation that, in the author's opinion, determined the further vector of transformation of administrative processes was the integration of payment and government information systems. Such a technological solution, implemented through a closer partnership between government and corporate entities, combined with the spread of individual mobile digital devices – smartphones and tablets – has become the basis for the development of unified digital platforms designed to optimize both the provision and receipt of virtually all socially important services. The article also examines the role of government information systems in the development of the data economy and highlights emerging models of government regulation in this area. The following trends of digitalization in the public sector are analysed as relevant: regulators of digital ecosystems acquiring the ability to provide digital services to extraterritorial communities, scaling digital infrastructure in territories with high population concentration when implementing economic development projects and introducing digital technologies in the social sphere.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b82b6ed66e4d1eef776e64d8fe149cfdda6bcddb,True
E-Government Insights to Smart Cities Research: European Union (EU) Study and the Role of Regulations,"The recent evolution of smart cities research has initiated a holistic dialogue for the integration of past initiatives promoting e-government at European Union Level. At the same moment Future Smart Cities research, is justified as a multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research domain. Within this context this research work provides insights for the integration of Economics, E-government, Information Systems, and Social Sciences. The study addresses the e-government process as one of the most important application of smart cities in our current societies. More specifically, we have examined the existence of $\beta $ -convergence between EU member states in terms of e-government services, confirming the hypothesis that low performance countries record higher growth rate than developed countries. In order to move closer to the factors with high impact on e-government development, we have analyzed other variables for testing the differences between countries, in terms of education, digital skills and access to internet for controlling the hypothesis that countries initially have different development conditions and they will not probably converge to the same steady state. We found that the opportunity of using e-services, particularly e-government services, is less accessible to citizens with low overall digital skills and, as is technically normal, to those with low access to internet access. In this context, at EU level it is needed to rethink and design the e-government services in order to be adapted not only to needs of the citizens, but also to their digital skills. The main contribution of this research is two-fold: From one side provides an integrated study with emphasis on the impact of social sciences and economics research to Future Smart Cities Research and from the other side it brings forward several soft factors for the adoption of Smart Cities services in the context of government transformation and provision of ubiquitous e-services to citizens.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6803848fef6400f399e6efb9e7ab50d445da88fc,True

However, in certain types of software, many agencies in the public sector are bound by the laws on competition and financed by governmental budgeting processes. Consequently, the acquiring agencies adapt their processes to what the existing systems allow due to complexities in making changes and modifications. In this paper, we study the relation of public sector software acquisition and delivery, and the continuously changing nature of software. Then, we analyse pain points of evolving software in public sector information systems, and propose technical artefacts to improve the status quo. Finally, to add flexibility to public sector information systems’ acquisition and evolution, we elaborate a novel architectural pattern called Mosaic architecture, based on macroservices, which allows independent subcontracting, development, and deployment.

The impact of public sector scorecard adoption on the effectiveness of accounting information systems towards the sustainable performance in public sector,"Abstract The effectiveness of accounting information system (AIS) in public sector organization (PSO) is well recognized to play an important part in obtaining sustainable performance (SP). Nevertheless, the effectiveness of AIS cannot achieve the SP on its own due to the rapid changing in the global economic world. Accordingly, there is an increasing demand on a framework of evaluation which is considered to be appropriate with the characteristics of PSO to orientate, manage, and assess operations of AIS toward attaining SP. Thus, this study is undertaken with the aim at exploring the relationship between the impact of public sector scorecard (PSS) implementations and effectiveness of AIS toward SP enhancement with evidence gathered from 883 PSOs’ accountants in Mekong Delta region. Data analyzed by the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) highlight that PSS adoption has a significant impact on the effectiveness of AIS. It also provides a reliable basis for the association between the effectiveness of AIS and SP.

This study is an initial attempt to determine whether HRIS has reached these potential benefits. Based on responses from a sample of HR directors of from public universities we found that, while valuable, HRIS has not yet reached its full potential in this environment.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c0fc0185e46672a97384698a2d90250240e3d7d2,True
Public-sector Financial Management and E-government: The Role Played by Accounting Systems,"ABSTRACT The paper investigates the relationship between two central features of public-sector financial management reforms: accounting innovations and e-government. It focuses on the quality and ease of access to information provided by different accounting systems and e-government strategies. Based on a sample of 33 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, the findings underscore the need to adopt a holistic perspective that considers not only technological issues but also the quality and integrity of information, its international comparability, and the socioeconomic context. The results suggest that both technical and social factors should be considered in adopting e-government.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a04b9b4aac97298bb3277492e67e63ec1c9d6f64,False
Value–Based Guiding Principles for Managing Cognitive Computing Systems in the Public Sector,"Abstract Cognitive Computing Systems (CCSs) are increasing in prominence in the public sector. This paper develops a framework drawing on public value and information technology service management literature to guide the management of CCSs in the public sector. We draw on academic literature, gray literature, legislation and government reports, and examples on CCS initiatives in the public sector to develop insights for research and practice. We then outline the themes and present the insights in the form of guiding principles and specific (detailed) recommendations. These include guiding principles and recommendations for establishing legitimacy, understanding the required capabilities, executing capabilities, creating and measuring public value.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d82085d4c4b3c82914c5d0b2084b37a90e79bc8d,True
The role of data and information security governance in protecting public sector data and information assets in national government in South Africa,"Background: The deployment of information and communications technology (ICT) in the public sector, has been exposed to increasing security breaches and cyber-related crimes that have resulted in unauthorised access, theft, fraud and misuse of highly confidential, classified and sensitive public sector data and information (PSDI) assets. The government, as one of the biggest collectors and distributors of PSDI assets, needs to be constantly aware of the risks associated with the collection, classification, storage and dissemination of critical PSDI assets. The lack of sufficient data and information security measures could pose significant security risks that could impact on state security, thus causing national working relationships to be strained, which presents gaps and opportunities for external intruders to capitalise on the mistrust of the government to infiltrate further attacks on critical Information Technology (IT) infrastructure and systems. In order to mitigate and counteract critical and sensitive data and information-related crimes, the government must understand and analyse the importance of data and information security governance (DISG) and how it should be institutionalised through an integrated approach to improve and protect PSDI assets. Aim: The aim of this article is to analyse the institutionalisation of DISG measures government has implemented towards the protection of PSDI assets. Setting: The research setting is in three national government departments, namely the Department of Energy (DoE), the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) and the Department of Science and Technology (DST). This study investigates how the strategic combination of data governance (DG) and information security governance (ISG) practices and principles could be implemented and incorporated as one of the various approaches in public sector institutions to improve the DISG management functions of an organisation’s overall data and information systems and processes. Methods: The research approach is qualitative, and the research methodology includes a multiple case study design. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and was triangulated with literature review. Primary data was analysed using thematic analysis. Results: The research findings are presented according to the McKinsey 7S model, which served as the analytical framework in the study. The research findings indicate that the institutionalisation of DISG management practices and functions in the South African public sector context are very limited, and there is a dominant focus on IT and IT security. It was also identified that DISG policies, practices, and systems have been found to be lacking in public sector management and governance functions. Conclusion: The study concludes that there is currently a lack of sufficient DISG policies, management practices and systems, particularly in the national sphere of government.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0f5b408625d260125b7fbb2d51417ea7a1991bec,True
A Framework for the Adoption of Blockchain-Based e-Procurement Systems in the Public Sector,"Public procurement constitutes a core government function for providing goods and services to citizens. The overall success of a digitized public-procurement function yields progress and economic growth for the nation. In this research, we analyze the potential of blockchain-based systems to enhance effectiveness, ease, and transparency in public procurement in the case of Nigeria and identify the current challenges facing public procurement, i.e., lack of trust and transparency among critical stakeholders in the procurement process, systems that only weakly support transaction recording and documentation, complex process structures, corruption in institutions involved in the procurement process. To address these issues, a blockchain-based framework is developed to enable interoperability of information-systems involved in the procurement process, increase citizen participation in eliciting project requirements and to enable a more transparent project monitoring and auditing. We apply the framework to a case study with respect to identifying on-chain activities that enable system interoperability, e-participation and project auditability.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6a6c50c74125765f68e32f56a771c1188148eb38,True
Critical Success Factors Affecting Information System Satisfaction in Public Sector Organizations: A Perspective on the Mediating Role of Information Quality,"Many studies have investigated technology adoption in western countries and ignored the Arab region. The available Arab studies focused on the technology adoption model (TAM) and its subsequent variations while leaving important factors such as information quality, user involvement, availability of training and top management support on the success of information systems (IS). Despite that these factors were studied scantly in some past studies, this research attempts to fill this gap and develop a more integrative model of IS success. Results indicated the existence of four critical success factors, three organizational factors (management support, training, user involvement), and an information system factor (information quality), that affect IS success (use and satisfaction). Results found that information quality for the first time mediates the effect of the three organizational factors on IS success, while TAM components (perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use) have no effect.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dafc900f1ed0a345772335b7c396b868238ad7ef,True
How is the Use of Performance Information Related to Performance of Public Sector Professionals? Evidence from the Field of Academic Research,"ABSTRACT There is inconclusive evidence as to how performance management is actually related to performance, particularly in subfields of the public sector where professional work prevails. We propose that the association between the use of performance information and performance of public sector professionals varies with the targets of management control. We test our hypotheses in the field of academic research, a prime example of professionalism in the public sector. The overall results of an online survey with 1,976 observations suggest that performance management is positively related to publication performance when performance information is used for the control of input targets. In contrast, we find negative associations of performance information with performance when used to control output targets. Public managers in professional fields should consider these countervailing relationships when they compose and use control systems.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6123a5b7de12704b080a6cc34bb829aed4eb3921,True

Information technology systems in public sector health facilities in developing countries: the case of South Africa,"BackgroundThe public healthcare sector in developing countries faces many challenges including weak healthcare systems and under-resourced facilities that deliver poor outcomes relative to total healthcare expenditure. Global references demonstrate that information technology has the ability to assist in this regard through the automation of processes, thus reducing the inefficiencies of manually driven processes and lowering transaction costs. This study examines the impact of hospital information systems implementation on service delivery, user adoption and organisational culture within two hospital settings in South Africa.MethodsNinety-four interviews with doctors, nurses and hospital administrators were conducted in two public sector tertiary healthcare facilities (in two provinces) to record end-user perceptions. Structured questionnaires were used to conduct the interviews with both qualitative and quantitative information.ResultsNoteworthy differences were observed among the three sample groups of doctors, nurses and administrators as well as between our two hospital groups. The impact of automation in terms of cost and strategic value in public sector hospitals is shown to have yielded positive outcomes with regard to patient experience, hospital staff workflow enhancements, and overall morale in the workplace.ConclusionThe research provides insight into the reasons for investing in system automation, the associated outcomes, and organisational factors that impact the successful adoption of IT systems. In addition, it finds that sustainable success in these initiatives is as much a function of the technology as it is of the change management function that must accompany the system implementation.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/18fe406a435037484cddad04f3a3baaa7af36b50,True

Integrated Financial Management Information Systems: Guidelines for effective implementation by the public sector of South Africa,"Background: Integrated Financial Management Information Systems (IFMIS) can improve public sector management by providing real-time financial information to managers in order to enhance their decision-making capabilities. The South African Public Service is currently busy with the implementation of an IFMIS. However, the implementation of such a project has proved to be a very demanding undertaking and has not been met with resounding success. Objectives: The research was conducted in order to identify the challenges and risks that are involved in the implementation of the IFMIS in South Africa. After identification of the challenges and risks, solutions or guidelines were developed that may make the implementation more successful. Method: The methodology that was used is that of a literature study where theories were explored and used to solve a research problem. Based on the theoretical research, solutions and guidelines were developed to solve challenges and risks experienced. Results: The results indicated that there are a number of challenges involved with the implementation of an IFMIS. A set of best practice guidelines was developed that may make the implementation more successful. Conclusion: The sheer size and complexity of an IFMIS poses significant challenges and a number of risks to the implementation process. There are, however, critical success factors or best practices that can be used for the project to succeed. It is recommended that these best practices be used by the South African Public Service.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/768e47e0f3403a215a4dc6c88c13217a71da1b1f,True
Understanding of blockchain-based identity management system adoption in the public sector,"PurposeThis study aims to understand the benefits and challenges associated with the adoption of a blockchain-based identity management system in public services by conducting an academic literature review, and to explore the design of such a system that can be applied to the Korean government.Design/methodology/approachThis study explores the adoption of a blockchain-based identity management system using a literature review and an actual design case intended for use by the government sector.FindingsBlockchain-based identity management systems can significantly improve transparency, accountability, and reliability in the user control of one's own data while reducing the time and cost needed to deliver public services, as well as increasing administrative efficiency. However, it is not always easy to implement such systems, and introducing new technologies in the government field requires a complicated, time-consuming process. There is currently an appetite for research extending beyond the typical technology-driven approach to elucidate the government adoption of new technologies and explore its implications.Practical implicationsThe idea behind this system is that by storing and managing personal information on the blockchain and providing mobile apps to customers, users can log in or retrieve previously authenticated personal information without having to go through an authentication process. Since users do not need to go through the verification process every time, it is expected that they will be able to access only the necessary personal information more quickly and conveniently without having to deal with unnecessary details. In addition, the blockchain-based operation of a public service effectively increases the transparency and reliability of that service and reduces the social costs caused by personal information leakage.Originality/valueThis study introduces the design of a blockchain-based identity management system that can be used in public services, specifically in the Korean government sector for the first time. Along with a literature review, the implications that this study gleans from these real-world use cases can contribute to this field of research.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/315d1f7b6effbc6edfe35cb1c8072f3b3bed59fe,True
Efficiency creep and shadow innovation: enacting ambidextrous IT Governance in the public sector,"ABSTRACT The current push towards increased innovation within the public sector calls for new approaches to IT Governance. However, recent findings highlight the aim to avoid trade-offs between innovation and efficiency through organisational ambidexterity. This paper reports a case study of ambidextrous IT Governance in two large government agencies. According to the findings, ambidextrous IT Governance is enacted through two separate but interrelated mechanisms that emerge simultaneously. In terms of exploitation, the “efficiency creep” mechanism creates a bias for efficiency – rather than innovation-oriented investments. In terms of exploration, the “shadow innovation” mechanism involves unsanctioned innovation activities. These two mechanisms interplay, in the enactment of ambidextrous IT Governance. The contribution of this study lies in theorising about how ambidextrous IT Governance is enacted in public sector organisations, and how efficiency creep and shadow innovation influence each other. This contribution aids future research and practice on public sector innovation and IT Governance.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/93ed6868c3f484c8b21a45e8f08571f400275f69,True
IT value creation in public sector: how IT-enabled capabilities mitigate tradeoffs in public organisations,"ABSTRACT Governments today are striving to improve services in the public sector through digital transformation programs but face tremendous pressures from multiple fronts (economy, national security, healthcare, education, etc.). Even when worldwide enterprise IT spending for the government and education markets has been increasing and is expected to surpass $652 billion in 2023 to cater to such transformation programs, 80% of the government transformation efforts failed to achieve expected results. A plausible reason for this lacklustre performance could be the presence of tradeoffs or conflicts that is particularly salient in public organisations. To better understand the mechanisms by which IT enables or inhibits capabilities of the public organisations in attaining public value, we adopt a conflict resolution lens to study how information technology (IT) enabled capabilities to mitigate these tradeoffs. Using a dataset collected from public organisations in a European country unreeling from a financial crisis, we examine the processes by which IT enables public organisations to manage the tradeoffs arising from conflicting value-based goals. We identify three mitigation strategies facilitated via IT-enabled organisational capabilities – bias, tunnelling and hybridisation. This paper contributes to the understanding of how IT mitigates value-based tradeoffs in public organisations to achieve public value.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73e3e2c7ed36fe13ac48ae9f5a9a093deeddf9b0,True
Exploring smartness in public sector innovation - creating smart public services with the Internet of Things,"ABSTRACT The use of the term “smartness” in the context of public service delivery indicates an ambition of the public sector to become more agile and resilient through the adoption of emerging technologies. The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that will be key to the realisation of smart public services. The research presented in this paper explored the role of IoT in public sector innovation through a qualitative study of how IoT technology can be leveraged to create and deliver smart winter road maintenance services. We use an existing smartness framework – based on the dimensions of efficiency, effectiveness, transparency and collaboration – to examine the consequences of introducing IoT-based innovation to road maintenance services. The findings suggest that IoT enables public sector innovation and that smartness is created through the combination of technology, people and organisations. The realisation of smartness in public sector innovation requires sufficient management capabilities and robust technology strategies, along with a willingness to explore and adopt new work practices rather than simply implement emerging technologies.",GOV,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/403194e35bbf24ba1e56901d87d42ecba6cde75e,True
Why do eGovernment Projects Fail? Risk Factors of Large Information Systems Projects in the Greek Public Sector: An International Comparison,"This paper presents an empirical study of the risk factors of large governmental information systems IS projects. For this purpose the Official Decisions of the Greek Government Information Technology Projects Advisory Committee ITPAC concerning 80 large IS projects have been analyzed and interviews with its members have been conducted. From this analysis 21 risk factors have been identified, and further elaborated and associated with inherent particular characteristics of the public sector, extending existing approaches in the literature. A categorization of them with respect to origin revealed that they are associated with the management, the processes, and the content of these projects. Results show that behind the identified risk factors there are political factors, which are associated with intra-organizational and inter-organizational politics and competition, and can be regarded as 'second level' risk sources. The risk factors identified in this study are compared with the ones found by similar studies conducted in Hong Kong, Finland, and the United States, and also with the ones mentioned by OECD reports.

"Role of perceived ease of use, usefulness, and financial strength on the adoption of health information systems: the moderating role of hospital size","Adoption of a health information system is always a challenge for hospitals. It is because most of the medical staff do not have enough skills to use the new technology and due to the sensitivity of medical data. These factors pose a challenge for the successful adoption of health information system in hospitals. The aim of this research is to find out the factors which influence the adoption of information systems in hospitals. The study investigated the impact of the Financial status of the Hospital; Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use on the adoption of health information systems through a questionnaire survey. Data was collected from 602 healthcare workers from 20 hospitals through close-ended questionnaire in Pakistan, where the adoption of health information systems is very slow. PLS-SEM was used for the analysis. The findings show that the Financial status of the Hospital; Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use have positive and significant role in the adoption of Health Information Systems. The finding also shows that hospital size moderates the relationship of Perceived ease of use and the adoption of health information systems and interestingly it does not moderate the relationship among perceived usefulness and financial strength toward the adoption of health information systems. The study concludes that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and financial strength are the main factors, necessary for the adoption of health information systems. The findings of the study have useful implications for policy makers, medical professionals to successfully adopt health information systems in hospitals. It also provides new avenues for researchers to explore other factors and test this framework in other countries.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed985cf6c2e0df205355d3c4e338413a20c13160,True
Barriers and facilitators to health technology adoption by older adults with chronic diseases: an integrative systematic review,"Background In recent years, healthcare systems have progressively adopted several technologies enhancing access to healthcare for older adults and support the delivery of efficient and effective care for this specific population. These technologies include both assistive technologies designed to maintain or improve the independence, social participation and functionality of older people at home, as well as health information technology developed to manage long-term conditions. Examples of such technologies include telehealth, wearable devices and mobile health. However, despite the great promise that health technology holds for promoting independent living among older people, its actual implementation remains challenging. Methods This study aimed to conduct an integrative systematic review of the research evidence on the factors that facilitate or hinder the adoption of different types of technology by older individuals with chronic diseases. For this purpose, four electronic databases (PsycArticles, Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed) were queried to search for indexed published studies. The methodological quality of the selected papers has been assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Results Twenty-nine articles were selected, including 6.213 adults aged 60 or older. The studies have been synthesised considering the types of technological interventions and chronic diseases, as well as the main barriers and facilitators in technology acceptance. The results revealed that the majority of the selected articles focused on comorbid conditions and the utilisation of telemedicine tools. With regard to hindering and facilitating factors, five main domains were identified: demographic and socioeconomic, health-related, dispositional, technology-related and social factors. Conclusion The study results have practical implications not only for technology developers but also for all the social actors involved in the design and implementation of healthcare technologies, including formal and informal caregivers and policy stakeholders. These actors could use this work to enhance their understanding of the utilisation of technology by the ageing population. This review emphasises the factors that facilitate technology adoption and identifies barriers that impede it, with the ultimate goal of promoting health and independent living.

Factors that affect health information technology adoption by seniors: A systematic review.,"The number of seniors and prevalence of chronic conditions are increasing worldwide, resulting in more pressure on health systems. Health Information Technologies (HIT) present opportunities to support the healthcare needs of seniors. Although prior studies have investigated HIT and seniors, it remains unclear what factors significantly affect the adoption of different HIT by elderly people in the community. A Systematic Review (SR) was conducted between December 2017 and February 2018 (with a search update in 2018-2019) to critically appraise and synthesise existing evidence on HIT adoption factors among seniors. Following the PRISMA guidelines, five major databases were consulted (PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science). The inclusion criteria consisted of empirical studies, published in English, and reporting impacts of specific factors on HIT adoption among seniors in the community. A total of 41 studies were included in this review, mostly published between 2014 and 2017 in Europe and the US; the level of evidence in these studies was low to moderate. The factors that affect HIT adoption did not differ across types of technologies or age groups. The findings reveal that seniors adopt HIT that are perceived as useful and requiring low effort commitment; price/cost value were reported as adoption barriers. Social influence, facilitating conditions, senior-friendly product design, self-efficacy, Intrinsic Technology Quality, experience/training and technology anxiety may affect HIT adoption by seniors, although the evidence on these impacts remains weak and limited. Mixed and inconclusive evidence was observed on the impacts of socio-demographic variables, health condition, habit and privacy/security. Given the reported low level of HIT adoption among seniors, we call for more rigorous research in this area using a 'senior-centred' approach, which takes into account the discourse/interaction between seniors and their collective environment to better understand the factors that affect their technology adoption and address their needs.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d98898e7f6ab0240f428f478504aab7fd6798f5e,True
Implementing Vertical Integration in the Industry 4.0 Journey: Which Factors Influence the Process of Information Systems Adoption?,"One of the key principles of Industry 4.0 is the implementation of vertical integration, which considers the integration of information systems from different hierarchical levels in a company to support decision-making with real-time data flows. Companies face challenges when they want to implement vertical integration, which is not trivial due to the risks inherent to the decision stages of adoption. We investigate the main factors influencing the different stages of adoption of vertical integration to provide a clearer view of what managers should consider at each stage. We adopt a multi-case study approach based on the investigation of ten companies that followed this adoption process. We develop a framework with 22 factors deployed in the three stages of decision (knowledge, persuasion, and final decision) and three main dimensions of analysis: technology, organization, and environment.

Information Technology/Systems Adoption in the Public Sector: Evidence From the Illinois Department of Transportation,"State government has been moving from manual and paper-based processes to digital services. However, digital divide, declining trust in technology, and low IT/IS adoption rates by public sector employees are important challenges for successful delivery of e-government services to citizens. Previous studies in the area of IT/IS adoption and e-government have mainly focused on citizens. This paper examines IT/IS adoption by employees rather than citizens and the focus is on non-market environment and state government agencies. A research model has been proposed based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and technology acceptance model (TAM) which has been extended to include digital divide related constructs and trust in technology. To test the proposed model, a survey was conducted among early adopters of Office 365 at Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) in Springfield and Chicago. The paper contributes to research on IT/IS adoption in public sector. The findings also provide insightful design and practical implications for successful IT/IS deployment in public sector.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bf52137f037861c0dbdec596a8d67b3426c5e5fb,True
Adoption of health information systems: Health professionals perspective,"ABSTRACT The healthcare industry has embraced Information and Communication Technology in the performance of its duties to provide quality healthcare services. Though this system provides numerous benefits, research has shown that adoption and use of such systems are limited in the developing world. This study examines factors that will motivate healthcare personnel to adopt and use Health Information Systems using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model. One hundred and ten (110) respondents were selected for the study. The data collected was analysed using Partial Least Square (PLS) with a standard error of 0.10. The findings indicate that Performance Expectancy, Habit and Hedonic Motivation are the main factors users considered to influence their behavioural intention to adopt and use health information system. The results show that when users perceive Health Information systems to improve their performance, they are more likely to adopt and use the system. Stakeholders should consider system quality issues, such as response time and interface design, when developing a new system as these serve as motivational factors towards adoption and use of health information system. This study is among the first few attempts to understand adoption and use of health information systems in Sub-Saharan Africa.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b774caa51b42858dda86bd8208ddba7fc71f9f2,True
Health Information Technology Adoption in the Emergency Department.,"OBJECTIVE To describe the trend in health information technology (IT) systems adoption in hospital emergency departments (EDs) and its effect on ED efficiency and resource use. DATA SOURCES 2007-2010 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey - ED Component. STUDY DESIGN We assessed changes in the percent of visits to EDs with health IT capability and the estimated effect on waiting time to see a provider, visit length, and resource use. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS The percent of ED visits that took place in an ED with at least a basic health IT or an advanced IT system increased from 25.2 and 3.1 percent in 2007 to 69.1 and 30.6 percent in 2010, respectively (p < .05). Controlling for ED fixed effects, waiting times were reduced by 6.0 minutes in advanced IT-equipped EDs (p < .05), and the number of tests ordered increased by 9 percent (p < .01). In models using a 1-year lag, advanced systems also showed an increase in the number of medications and images ordered per visit. CONCLUSIONS Almost a third of visits now occur in EDs with advanced IT capability. While advanced IT adoption may decrease wait times, resource use during ED visits may also increase depending on how long the system has been in place. We were not able to determine if these changes indicated more appropriate care.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/725e8f5770de01998103397255a5cbfac8dc7082,True

A framework development for the adoption of information and communication technology web technologies in higher education systems,"Background: The adoption of information and communication technology (ICT) tools into educational systems has been at the forefront of the educational sector for decades. The integration of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 technologies is progressively being encouraged worldwide across several universities to support teaching and learning processes and to offer students the possibility of learning experiences and engagements to suit their digital needs. Objectives: This article probes a framework development for the adoption of ICT web technologies in higher education systems (HES) and further suggests a framework for adoption with the aim of enhancing the mode of education delivery and improving business processes. An understanding of the benefits associated with Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 tools adoption is gained to support collaboration between students and educators and to build social presence through interactive learning. South African universities continue to experience circumstances in which many learners who enrol are novice users of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 tools and require optimal support to bridge the gaps and the knowledge and skills exposure required. The problem with educators’ inability to incorporate Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 tools in their teaching and learning practices exists. Method: A mixed-method approach was applied in this study. The researchers conducted 15 separate interviews with educators coupled with randomly distributed questionnaires to students across three universities (North-West University [NWU], University of South Africa [UNISA] and University of Pretoria [UP]), a total of 969 was recoverable and analysed using analytical tool ATLAS.ti and SPSS. The researchers further validated the data consolidating both techniques used to generate a holistic assessment of the data analysed from the quantitative to support the qualitative findings. Results: Findings revealed that these tools are useful and will have a positive effect on the pedagogical environment, although there are challenges that may be considered during the adoption. These challenges relate to human factors (e.g. technophobia and cultural beliefs), security issues (e.g. privacy and intellectual property rights [IPRs]), ethical and legal issues, ICT infrastructures (e.g. cost implication, risk and ICT teaching facilities); and university policy frameworks. Conclusion: Despite these challenges, Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 technologies in HES offer varieties of teaching and learning platforms and an improved business administration process.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5eddd8aaaa9118a54e336d28f406b7a400899d5d,True
The Success of Information Systems and Sustainable Information Society: Measuring the Implementation of a Village Financial System,"The purpose of this study is to advance the information society literature research by examining and developing the adoption of information systems within the Village Financial System (SISKEUDES) to improve the sustainable information society (SIS). The models include the DeLone and McLean model and trust theory, which involves eight variables: system information quality, information quality, service quality, trust in government organizations, trust in technology, usage, user satisfaction, net benefits, and sustainable information society. A survey questionnaire was used, and data was collected from SISKEUDES users in Bali, Indonesia, which were statistically analyzed using Partial Least Square (PLS) to understand the phenomena of Information System (IS) adoption and sustainable information society. The research findings reveal that system information quality, information quality, and trust in technology have a significant impact on usage and user satisfaction, whereas service quality and trust in government organizations do not have such an effect. The usage and user satisfaction variables have a significant effect on net benefits, and they have a significant effect on the sustainability of the SIS. This study’s findings can provide e-government practitioners with deeper insights into how to overcome problems with user satisfaction and increase trust in mandatory e-government services in realizing SIS and the “smart village”.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/31af64f9b331409fbb5753739ab18cc56376c128,True
A Systematic Review of Digital Technology Adoption in Off-Site Construction: Current Status and Future Direction towards Industry 4.0,"Off-site construction (OSC) is known as an efficient construction method that could save time and cost, reduce waste of resources, and improve the overall productivity of projects. Coupled with digital technologies associated with the Industry 4.0 concept, OSC can offer a higher rate of productivity and safety. While there is a rich literature focusing on both OSC and Industry 4.0, the implementation of associated digital technologies in the OSC context has not been fully evaluated. This paper intends to evaluate the current literature of digital technology applications in OSC. Scientometric analyses and a systematic review were carried out evaluating fifteen typical digital technologies adopted by OSC projects, including building information modelling (BIM), radio frequency identification devices (RFID), global positioning systems (GPS), the Internet of Things (IoT), geographic information systems (GIS), sensors, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), photogrammetry, laser scanning, artificial intelligence (AI), 3D printing, robotics, big data, and blockchain. This review formulates a clear picture of the current practice of these digital technologies and summarizes the main area of application and limitations of each technology when utilized in OSC. The review also points out their potential and how they can be better adopted to improve OSC practice in the future.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22a15985ac8eb2ee4ba92f17d2a76039a603d482,True
Investigating the Key Factors Influencing on Management Information Systems Adoption among Telecommunication Companies in Yemen: The Conceptual Framework Development,"Organizations invest in information technology and systems because they provide economic value to the business. While recognizing the importance of the management information systems in the organization, the majority of Arab countries in Middle East and underdeveloped countries are still dealing with issues in adopting the technologies. Research in technology adoption among the Middle East countries more focused on internet banking, e-government and e-commerce area. Notwithstanding that individuals in the Middle East are known as late adopter, organizations in Middle East are unable to infuse management system into their business processes. To fully adopt the management information systems, organization must understand the three dimensions of information system; organization, people and technology itself. Thus, this study aims to shed some light on the management information systems adoption among the employees at telecommunication companies in Yemen. The study of the country is still inadequate and less exposure. Hence, the purpose of this study is to provide a conceptual framework for analyzing the factors affecting management information systems adoption. As the organization responsible for providing internet and mobile phones, telecommunication companies should be the first to adopt the latest technology in the market to better provide good infrastructures. In accordance, this study may help managers and policy makers identify the factors in their effort to attract more employees and to adopt the management information systems in the organization.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a2b734002c10320d1a9d51cb866afbab3699268f,True
Cloud computing technology adoption: an evaluation of key factors in local governments,"PurposeThe significance of cloud services in information technology (IT) is increasing as a means of achieving enhanced productivity, efficiency and cost reduction. Through cloud-based service, the reliability and scalability of an organization’s systems can be enhanced since organizations such as local governments are able to concentrate on their main business strategies. This research seeks to identify critical factors that may have an impact on the acceptance of cloud-based services, where the organizational context is based on local governments in Australia.Design/methodology/approachTo formulate a more comprehensive IT innovation adoption model for cloud technology, factors from the technology-organizational-environment framework, desires framework and diffusion of innovation model were integrated. Data was obtained from 480 IT staff working in 47 local government organizations.FindingsThe research results show that the factors which had a statistically significant and positive impact on the adoption of cloud-based services in local governments were compatibility, complexity, cost, security concerns, expected benefits and organization size. It is likely that the outcomes from this research will provide insights to any organization seeking to make investment decisions on the adoption of cloud-based services.Research limitations/implicationsLimitations include generalizability of the findings since the data is restricted to local government areas in Queensland, Australia. Further, the sample mostly included individuals with managerial positions and may not completely capture the cloud adoption factors relevant for front line IT employees. Another limitation is the possible omission of factors that may be relevant but not considered due to the selected theories. Lastly, this research did not differentiate between different types of cloud adoption such as private, public, community and hybrid models that are possible in this context.Originality/valueThe paper provides a combination framework of cloud-based service adoption based on a literature review on cloud adoption from an IS perspective. It adapts integrated model to establish a more comprehensive innovation adoption framework for cloud technology.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab5161f3290f8947e3aff28e77263cb86eb84092,True
An Empirical Study of Factors Influencing Accounting Information Systems Adoption,"This study investigates the factors that influence accounting information systems (AIS) adoption among accountants. Drawing on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), the task–technology fit (TTF) model and the institutional theory, we developed a research model for AIS adoption by accountants. Data was collected from 216 accountants and multiple linear regression was employed to test the research model. The results showed that five key factors, namely effort expectancy, perceived technology fit, facilitating conditions, self-efficacy and coercive pressure are able to influence the likelihood that accountants would adopt the AIS. This research confirms the need to integrate UTAUT, TTF and institutional theory when studying AIS adoption factors. The findings from this study are useful for senior management, technology consultants, software vendors and accounting professional bodies in promoting the adoption of AIS.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9e460b41f2c4be77d6fdd632cb271cac4145181e,True
The Supply Chain Has No Clothes: Technology Adoption of Blockchain for Supply Chain Transparency,"Blockchain technology, popularized by Bitcoin cryptocurrency, is characterized as an open-source, decentralized, distributed database for storing transaction information. Rather than relying on centralized intermediaries (e.g., banks) this technology allows two parties to transact directly using duplicate, linked ledgers called blockchains. This makes transactions considerably more transparent than those provided by centralized systems. As a result, transactions are executed without relying on explicit trust [of a third party], but on the distributed trust based on the consensus of the network (i.e., other blockchain users). Applying this technology to improve supply chain transparency has many possibilities. Every product has a long and storied history. However, much of this history is presently obscured. Often, when negative practices are exposed, they quickly escalate to scandalous, and financially crippling proportions. There are many recent examples, such as the exposure of child labor upstream in the manufacturing process and the unethical use of rainforest resources. Blockchain may bring supply chain transparency to a new level, but presently academic and managerial adoption of blockchain technologies is limited by our understanding. To address this issue, this research uses the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the concept of technology innovation adoption as a foundational framework for supply chain traceability. A conceptual model is developed and the research culminates with supply chain implications of blockchain that are inspired by theory and literature review.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0058dba99b5f1a02d8ed29e2922b376d005f3b0,True
A Model for Examining Challenges and Opportunities in Use of Cloud Computing for Health Information Systems,"Health Information Systems (HIS) are becoming crucial for health providers, not only for keeping Electronic Health Records (EHR) but also because of the features they provide that can be lifesaving, thanks to the advances in Information Technology (IT). These advancements have led to increasing demands for additional features to these systems to improve their intelligence, reliability, and availability. All these features may be provisioned through the use of cloud computing in HIS. This study arrives at three dimensions pertinent to adoption of cloud computing in HIS through extensive interviews with experts, professional expertise and knowledge of one of the authors working in this area, and review of academic and practitioner literature. These dimensions are financial performance and cost; IT operational excellence and DevOps; and security, governance, and compliance. Challenges and drivers in each of these dimensions are detailed and operationalized to arrive at a model for HIS adoption. This proposed model detailed in this study can be employed by executive management of health organizations, especially senior clinical management positions like Chief Technology Officers (CTOs), Chief Information Officers (CIOs), and IT managers to make an informed decision on adoption of cloud computing for HIS. Use of cloud computing to support operational and financial excellence of healthcare organizations has already made some headway in the industry, and its use in HIS would be a natural next step. However, due to the mission′s critical nature and sensitivity of information stored in HIS, the move may need to be evaluated in a holistic fashion that can be aided by the proposed dimensions and the model. The study also identifies some issues and directions for future research for cloud computing adoption in the context of HIS.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c4ba7e6a068d333da5aa26a03aff1edb644e817e,True
Mobile health technology adoption across generations: Narrowing the digital divide,"Mobile health (m‐health) technologies offer many benefits to individuals, organizations, and health professionals alike. Indeed, the utilization of m‐health by older adults can foster the development of proactive patients, while also reducing financial burden and resource pressures on health systems. However, the potentially transformative influence of m‐health is limited, as many older adults resist adoption leading to the emergence of an age‐based digital divide. This study leverages protection motivation theory and social cognitive theory to explore the factors driving resistance among older adults. This mixed methods study integrates survey findings with insights from qualitative interviews to highlight that the m‐health digital divide is deepening due to older adults' perceived inability to adopt and their unwillingness to adopt stemming from mistrust, high risk perceptions, and strong desire for privacy. The paper contributes to the privacy and social inclusion literature by demonstrating that while many older adults have access to m‐health, they are currently excluded and require careful consideration by technology organizations and researchers. The study provides recommendations for narrowing the m‐health digital divide through inclusive design and educational efforts to improve self‐efficacy, develop privacy literacy, and build trust, thereby ensuring that older citizens are both capable and willing to adopt.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07837996855116c8bed75ade523934d8e3737ed1,True
Review of Technology Adoption Models and Theories to Measure Readiness and Acceptable Use of Technology in a Business Organization,"It has been evident that innovative technologies have evolved in the past few decades, notably, in the computing discipline. As a result, technology adoption models and theories are deemed vital to business organizations to assess if end users are ready and accept new technologies. Therefore, requirements to review prevailing technology adoption models and theories which seek to assist business organizations to assess the readiness and acceptance of these new technologies, otherwise, such initiatives become obsolete and do not support core business processes, as it was originally intended. This paper reviews three technology adoption models relevant to information systems and information technology studies on the latest technologies such as ERP, cloud computing, and other systems implemented in business organizations. The study could assist to analyse the acceptance and utilization of new technologies. It can also be used to improve such models and theories in the adoption of new technologies.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/62f355eda2cc000644d775a8e93b56c7250b7d50,True

"Information Systems, Technology Adoption and Innovation Translation","A new Information System must be adopted before it can be used. New Information Systems can be seen as innovations and viewed through the lens of innovations theory. In this article I will argue that much Information Systems research falls into this category, and that its explanation could benefit from application of innovation theory. One of the difficulties facing any such investigation, however, is that not all of these innovations are adopted in the form in which they were proposed – not all are adopted without change, and many approaches to technological innovation have trouble in explaining this. I will propose that Innovation Translation, informed by Actor-Network Theory, can offer a useful way of examining technological innovations, and particularly in explaining adoptions involving only some parts of the innovation. In this article I give several examples of how I have used Innovation Translation to shed light onto various technological innovations.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d343ca5fe818d873ea4d7e0b31cc5299569ba95f,True
What Drives the Adoption of the Blockchain Technology? A Fit-Viability Perspective,"ABSTRACT Blockchain technology has the promise of transforming security and trust in digital transactions. However, concerns about technical complexity and the benefits of deployment have blunted its adoption. We examine factors that influence managerial intention to adopt blockchain technology. We extend the fit-viability model (FVM) and develop a value-based technology adoption model through an empirical study of 242 managers mostly in medical and financial industries. Managers in such organizations are likely to consider fit and viability in adopting blockchain technology to store and protect data. Drawing upon Fit-Viability and Task-Technology Fit models, and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), we test a model with Partial Least Squares (PLS) to assess managers’ intention to adopt blockchain technology. Our findings indicate that functional and symbolic benefits have positive impact on managers’ assessment of task-technology fit. Furthermore, viability is an important criterion in adopting blockchain technology.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/96437dc7b390fc9ed1bfae39062fc58e8298273d,True

Exploring the motivators of technology adoption in healthcare,"ABSTRACT This paper seeks to determine the motivators that affect the adoption of information technology (IT), specifically in modern healthcare systems, based on a case study in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The aim is to identify, examine, and place in a hierarchical structure, based on a two-step exploratory methodology, the motivators for IT adoption of four main categories of healthcare stakeholders (employees, patients, UAE citizens and residents, and accredited foresight experts) via an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model. AHP revealed the relative importance weights of the seven IT adoption motivators and their 41 sub-motivators. Government support was found to be the most important group of motivators, followed by knowledge sharing, infrastructure, green management, lean management, internal/external environment, and social sustainability. The paper facilitates improving technology adoption generally, specifically in the UAE’s healthcare system. A Pareto chart visually presents the ranking of all sub-factors to help supply-chain practitioners better allocate resources for IT implementation. Little research has examined the combined perspectives of various stakeholders and no study has hitherto investigated the significant motivators of IT adoption in the UAEs’ healthcare industry. Including foresight experts is new in this domain.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8cc75050d8007242b897bdd4d3f21770e5f5c1c7,True
A Systematic Review of Social Media Acceptance From the Perspective of Educational and Information Systems Theories and Models,"The study of social media acceptance and adoption is not a new research topic. However, the analysis of the educational and information systems (IS) theories/models that are used to examine the social media acceptance and adoption is considered an important research direction. To examine these theories/models and provide researchers with a clear vision of this research topic, we should be aware of the leading educational and IS theories/models used in this line of research. To this end, this systematic review retrieved and analyzed 2,382 articles. The retrieved articles were then critically examined to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, in which 122 articles published between 2009 and 2018 were eventually selected for further critical analysis. The main findings indicated that the uses and gratifications theory (U&G) and the social constructivism theory were considered the most widely used educational theories in social media. Besides, the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) were considered the most extensively used IS models in studying the social media acceptance and adoption.

The impact of information technology and communication systems on the agility of supply chain management systems,"PurposeThe impact of information technology (IT) on the agility of supply chain management (SCM) systems is very noticeable in the business world nowadays. Competition and constant changes, including product/technological innovations, decreasing product lifestyles and product proliferation, create pressure that affects the business environment. Organizations are required for answering the changes in the market to gain a competitive advantage and business success. The organizations are able to answer to unexpected market changes through supply chain market, and these changes are converted to business opportunities. Using IT to achieve the agility of SCM is one of the important factors to help the organizations. Therefore, the adoption of IT and its efficient implementation can improve the cooperation between supply chain agility through the rapid transfer, the distribution of accurate information and the use of information. This paper aims to investigate the impact of IT on the agility of SCM.Design/methodology/approachA total of 120 employees of the Golasal firm are involved in collecting data using a questionnaire.

Ontology Middleware for Integration of IoT Healthcare Information Systems in EHR Systems,"Healthcare sectors have been at the forefront of the adoption and use of IoT technologies for efficient healthcare diagnosis and treatment. Because healthcare IoT sensor technology obtains health-related data from patients, it needs to be integrated with the electronic healthcare records (EHR) system. Most EHR systems have not been designed for integration with IoT technology; they have been designed to be more patient-centric management systems. The use of the IoT in EHR remains a long-term goal. Configuring IoT in EHR can enhance patient healthcare, enabling health providers to monitor their patients outside of the clinic. To assist physicians to access data resources efficiently, a data model that is semantic and flexible is needed to connect EHR data and IoT data that may help to provide true interoperability and integration. This research proposes a semantic middleware that exploits ontology to support the semantic integration and functional collaborations between IoT healthcare Information Systems and EHR systems.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e7023c730e3346974963efdfc1e4f35fc2837c7a,True
Specialized Information Systems for the Digitally Disadvantaged,"A number of specialized information systems for the digitally disadvantaged (SISD) have been developed to offset the limitations of people less able to participate in the information society. However, contributions from social identity theory and social markedness theory indicate that SISD can activate a stigmatized identity and thus be perceived unfavorably by their target audience. We identify two mechanisms by which functional limitations affect a digitally disadvantaged person’s adoption decision: (1) adoption decision as shaped through technology perceptions (i.e., perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived access barriers), and (2) adoption decision as shaped through marked status awareness (i.e., stigma consciousness). We test our contextualized research model on digitally disadvantaged users with physical and/or sensory disabilities. Results of our mediation analysis show that the individuals who have the most to gain from SISD use (i.e., those with greater perceived functional limitations) are doubly disadvantaged: as a group, they find it more challenging to use SISD and are also more sensitive to the fear of being marked as disadvantaged or vulnerable.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba17d6a207a20061463d3a06f309c19733b12b0b,True

"Smart Farming Technology Trends: Economic and Environmental Effects, Labor Impact, and Adoption Readiness","Farming faces challenges that increase the adverse effects on farms’ economics, labor, and the environment. Smart farming technologies (SFTs) are expected to assist in reverting this situation. In this work, 1064 SFTs were derived from scientific papers, research projects, and industrial products. They were classified by technology readiness level (TRL), typology, and field operation, and they were assessed for their economic, environmental, and labor impact, as well as their adoption readiness from end-users. It was shown that scientific articles dealt with SFTs of lower TRL than research projects. In scientific articles, researchers investigated mostly recording technologies, while, in research projects, they focused primarily on farm management information systems and robotic/automation systems. Scouting technologies were the main SFT type in scientific papers and research projects, but variable rate application technologies were mostly located in commercial products. In scientific papers, there was limited analysis of economic, environmental, and labor impact of the SFTs under investigation, while, in research projects, these impacts were studied thoroughly. Further, in commercial SFTs, the focus was on economic impact and less on labor and environmental issues. With respect to adoption readiness, it was found that all of the factors to facilitate SFT adoption became more positive moving from SFTs in scientific papers to fully functional commercial SFTs, indicating that SFTs reach the market when most of these factors are addressed for the benefit of the farmers. This SFT analysis is expected to inform researchers on adapting their research, as well as help policy-makers adjust their strategy toward digitized agriculture adoption and farmers with the current situation and future trends of SFTs.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b8f61a669624608d361e8539de2e85a84bad1cf,True
Determinants of information technology adoption: an extension of existing models to firms in a developing country,"Advances in new information technology and changes in the global environment have made it increasingly difficult for organizations to make decisions regarding information technology adoption. Moreover, information systems in a global environment are influenced by different cultures, laws, information technology infrastructure, and the availability and role of skilled personnel. Information systems research has traditionally focused on organizations in US and UK without considering how these frameworks and models can be applied and extended to developing countries. In this study of 46 firms we examine the determinants of process-based information technology adoption in the Indian manufacturing sector. Although there are many differences like the type of organizations, and the technology available, between developing and developed countries, we found that factors that influence information technology adoption are similar. Our results showed that organizational factors like a firmâ€™s culture and size, and environmental factors like competition faced by firms, government policies, and market forces like exchange rates and computer prices, have a significant impact on information technology adoption decisions made by firms. We also found that the role of management information systems personnel has a negative impact on adoption.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07318a16f8d7011eea98860934aa15e2c424f5f1,True
"Technology Acceptance Model' Concepts, Contribution, Limitation, and Adoption in Education","Numerous models have been provided by researchers in the past to determine and assess the success of Information Systems.

Here we are studying the Technology acceptance Models (TAM) and debating their features, contributions, and the limits of the earlier version of this theory. The TAM model, created by Davis (1989), is applied to determine the acceptance, adoption, and utilization of information technology. It is prevalent two constructs are used in TAM, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The TAM model gained extensive popularity between the researchers, and it is among the most effective models. TAM is dissimilar to other models as it does not measure success. However, it is employed to investigate and predict the users' intention to use Information technology. Since technology acceptance in an academic environment is becoming well-known, what had resulted in hubs of learning describes as an online learning community. Therefore, this paper gives a review of the present state of research on the Technology Acceptance Model. It offers a concise entry point to the theory's background and its adoption in education, which might be purposely advantageous for novice readers. The knowing of these models allows us to know the factors that impact the adoption of IS in the education environment to take advantage of this tool.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1e15e1ce9be7b7087ab857374fac09f80204f0fd,True
Information technology adoption in health care: when organisations and technology collide.,"The implementation of advanced information systems is enabling great social and organisational changes. However, health care has been one of the slowest sectors to adopt and implement information technology (IT). This paper investigates why this is so, reviewing innovation diffusion theory and its application to both health organisations and information technology. Innovation diffusion theory identifies variables that influence the 'innovativeness' of organisations and the rate at which a technology diffuses. When analysed, these variables show why IT implementation has progressed at a slower rate in health compared with other industry sectors. The complexity of health organisations and their fragmented internal structure constrain their ability to adopt organisation wide IT. This is further impacted upon by the relative immaturity of strategic health IT which is complicated and unable to show quantifiable benefits. Both organisational and technological factors lead to the slow adoption of strategic IT. On the other hand, localised IT solutions and those providing measurable cost reductions have diffused well.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1e3dbb083f75dafc5ffeeb0c9bd07136b4b0c4d4,True
A Temporal Model of Institutional Interventions for Information Technology Adoption in Less-Developed Countries,"This empirical study of Internet adoption in four Latin American countries delineates a gradual but progressive course of institutional actions and suggests a temporal ordering of the actions--including knowledge building, subsidy, knowledge deployment, innovation directive, and standard setting. The temporal model reveals how each country sustained the momentum of its evolving strategy, grew in competence to forge technological solutions, and gained access to the Internet. The four countries' original goals changed, but through experience they perceived new opportunities and established evolving Internet strategies that form the bases of new technological services provided at the national level.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d05bc7d43cd69b8e7ca85873c8ed8aa4b88fc879,True
Organic pest management decisions: a systems approach to technology adoption,"Organic farmers make system‐level crop protection decisions that combine complementary insect, disease, nematode, and weed management strategies. Data from a 1997 national survey of U.S. organic farmers were used in a multivariate count data model to identify the farm and regional factors influencing the adoption of practices across the linked pest management categories. The results show that weed management requires the greatest management effort by organic farmers. More intensive information‐seeking and on‐farm experimentation, higher educational attainment, and intensity of commitment to organic farming are positively related to the number of weed control strategies adopted. Predictions of adoption based on this model and customized to farm and region specifications will give information providers lead time to develop technical support for reduced chemical pest management systems.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e239f58ff99e8fd6d15550a3fed9d5075fb2c412,True
Transfer and adoption of advanced information technology solutions in resource-poor environments: the case of telemedicine systems adoption in Ethiopia.,"The study of the adoption of information technology (IT) by individuals has taken two approaches, one emphasizing rationalistic goal-oriented behavior and the other focusing on poignant forces that influence an individual's reaction to a new IT. These approaches are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Individuals' acceptance and subsequent usage of a new IT is predicated on both. Additionally, the tendency in past studies has been to examine either the rational or the poignant factors in the context of a ""resource-rich"" environment-one in which there is an abundance of IT, adequate infrastructure, and a high level of acculturation to technology solutions. Consequently, there is a clear need for the examination of these factors in resource-poor environments, where assumptions on technology abundance and technology culturation do not hold. We empirically test a model that explains the intention of physicians in a resource-poor environment (epitomized by rural Ethiopia) to adopt telemedicine systems. This model integrates the rational factors driving goal-oriented behavior with the poignant/emotive factors that are an innate part of each adopter's reaction to the new technology. We use the model to expose salient contextual factors that explain the acceptance behavior of individuals toward complex information and communications technology (ICT) solutions and implications of these on the management of technology transfer initiatives in a resource-poor environment. The model is parsimonious, yet explains 28% of the variance in the intention to adopt telemedicine systems and 58% in perceived ease of use. The theoretical and practical implications of this model are discussed. Namely, Sub-Saharan African, in general, and Ethiopian culture, in particular, plays an integral role in the adoption of ICT solutions. Organizational positions and roles among physicians, clinical professionals, and superiors stand to impact the adoption of telemedicine and other healthcare applications. Last, the degree to which users perceive that ICT is easy to use (i.e., ease of use) can be a function of technology experience and can influence perceived usefulness on behalf of users and healthcare organizations.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/871db8149188a7a439699e76931bcda5e52b9a48,True
Enhancing the Effectiveness of Consumer-Focused Health Information Technology Systems Through eHealth Literacy: A Framework for Understanding Users' Needs,"Background eHealth systems and applications are increasingly focused on supporting consumers to directly engage with and use health care services. Involving end users in the design of these systems is critical to ensure a generation of usable and effective eHealth products and systems. Often the end users engaged for these participatory design processes are not actual representatives of the general population, and developers may have limited understanding about how well they might represent the full range of intended users of the eHealth products. As a consequence, resulting information technology (IT) designs may not accommodate the needs, skills, cognitive capacities, and/or contexts of use of the intended broader population of health consumers. This may result in challenges for consumers who use the health IT systems, and could lead to limitations in adoption if the diversity of user attributes has not been adequately considered by health IT designers. Objective The objective of this paper is to propose how users’ needs and competences can be taken into account when designing new information and communications technology solutions in health care by expanding the user-task-context matrix model with the domains of a new concept of eHealth literacy. Methods This approach expands an existing method for supporting health IT system development, which advocates use of a three-dimensional user-task-context matrix to comprehensively identify the users of health IT systems, and what their needs and requirements are under differing contexts of use. The extension of this model involved including knowledge about users’ competences within the seven domains of eHealth literacy, which had been identified based on systematic engagement with computer scientists, academics, health professionals, and patients recruited from various patient organizations and primary care. A concept map was constructed based on a structured brainstorm procedure, card sorting, and computational analysis. Results The new eHealth literacy concept (based on 7 domains) was incorporated as a key factor in expanding the user-task-context matrix to describe and qualify user requirements and understanding related to eHealth literacy. This resulted in an expanded framework and a five-step process, which can support health IT designers in understanding and more accurately addressing end-users’ needs, capabilities, and contexts to improve effectiveness and broader applicability of consumer-focused health IT systems. It is anticipated that the framework will also be useful for policy makers involved in the planning, procuring, and funding of eHealth infrastructure, applications, and services. Conclusions Developing effective eHealth products requires complete understanding of the end-users’ needs from multiple perspectives. In this paper, we have proposed and detailed a framework for modeling users’ needs for designing eHealth systems that merges prior work in development of a user-task-context matrix with the emerging area of eHealth literacy. This framework is intended to be used to guide design of eHealth technologies and to make requirements explicitly related to eHealth literacy, enabling a generation of well-targeted, fit-for-purpose, equitable, and effective products and systems.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3f1f51c288121ad91a0a13d04f292af1afd36c8f,True
The Social Component of Information Systems - How Sociability Contributes to Technology Acceptance,"Research Article Iris Junglas Florida State University iris.junglas@gmail.com Lakshmi Goel University of North Florida l.goel@unf.edu Chon Abraham College of William and Mary chon.abraham@mason.wm.edu Blake Ives University of Houston bives@mac.com The adoption of information systems is often explained in terms of usefulness and ease of use. Lately, researchers have begun to recognize that a hedonic streak in human beings provides a further contributing factor in the adoption and acceptance of information systems. Embedded in this streak is a broader social aspect that incorporates not only the solitary, individual pleasure one gets from using the system, but also a pleasure that one gets from interacting and socializing with others through the system. This becomes particularly evident in virtual environments that support high levels of interaction with others and with artifacts embedded in an immersive context. By drawing on IS theories of technology acceptance and IS success, and on theories of social interaction from evolutionary psychology, activity theory, situated action, and distributed cognition, we test the construct of sociability and its antecedents in Second Life—a popular virtual environment. Our results support that, in addition to an information and system component, a social component contributes to IS usage.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4661a950dac92a031c4c31a8b63f67f6e3d57f8f,True

An extension of the technology acceptance model for understanding travelers’ adoption of variable message signs,"Understanding travelers’ acceptance of Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) is crucial to the implementation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) capable of mitigating traffic congestion and improving network performance. This paper adopted an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to predict and explain road users’ intention to use Variable Message Sign (VMS) information. In addition to the traditional parsimonious TAM constructs (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and behavioral intention), the model examined the effects of attitude towards route diversion, familiarity with road network and information quality on road users’ acceptance of VMS. 762 drivers were interviewed and the obtained data were processed using Structural Equation Modeling. The results showed that travelers’ attitude towards route diversion had a positive effect on perceived usefulness and intention to use VMS. Information quality had a positive direct effect on perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and attitude towards route diversion. Familiarity with the network had a positive effect on attitude towards route diversion and a negative effect on the perceived usefulness of VMS information. Perceived ease of use significantly and positively affected perceived usefulness and intention to use VMS. Perceived usefulness also had a positive effect on intention. Several academic and practical implications were also discussed.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/40ac3240b9791d50ce33109411a3e3a0e983f955,True
Development of an Instrument to Measure the Perceptions of Adopting an Information Technology Innovation,"This paper reports on the development of an instrument designed to measure the various perceptions that an individual may have of adopting an information technology IT innovation. This instrument is intended to be a tool for the study of the initial adoption and eventual diffusion of IT innovations within organizations. While the adoption of information technologies by individuals and organizations has been an area of substantial research interest since the early days of computerization, research efforts to date have led to mixed and inconclusive outcomes. The lack of a theoretical foundation for such research and inadequate definition and measurement of constructs have been identified as major causes for such outcomes. In a recent study examining the diffusion of new end-user IT, we decided to focus on measuring the potential adopters' perceptions of the technology. Measuring such perceptions has been termed a ""classic issue"" in the innovation diffusion literature, and a key to integrating the various findings of diffusion research. The perceptions of adopting were initially based on the five characteristics of innovations derived by Rogers 1983 from the diffusion of innovations literature, plus two developed specifically within this study. Of the existing scales for measuring these characteristics, very few had the requisite levels of validity and reliability. For this study, both newly created and existing items were placed in a common pool and subjected to four rounds of sorting by judges to establish which items should be in the various scales. The objective was to verify the convergent and discriminant validity of the scales by examining how the items were sorted into various construct categories. Analysis of inter-judge agreement about item placement identified both bad items as well as weaknesses in some of the constructs' original definitions. These were subsequently redefined. Scales for the resulting constructs were subjected to three separate field tests. Following the final test, the scales all demonstrated acceptable levels of reliability. Their validity was further checked using factor analysis, as well as conducting discriminant analysis comparing responses between adopters and nonadopters of the innovation. The result is a parsimonious, 38-item instrument comprising eight scales which provides a useful tool for the study of the initial adoption and diffusion of innovations. A short, 25 item, version of the instrument is also suggested.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed6d9295d9fedb35701ee548deeb13edd29b8829,True
Towards a systemic model on information systems' adoption using critical systems thinking,"Purpose – This paper aims to propose an extended version of systems development life cycle (SDLC) based on critical systems thinking for information system (IS) adoption in an organizational context from a management perspective.Design/methodology/approach – The model integrates traditional SDLC with the ongoing process of “phase‐stakeholders‐identification” or “pha‐stak‐ification”. The emerging systemic stakeholder networks is proposed to be applied with network mechanisms to influence stakeholders' attitudes towards IS adoption. The authors, considering IS adoption as a multi‐phase innovation project, argue that boundary considerations using a multiple stakeholder perspective (boundary critique) provides an alternative focus for IS adoption.Findings – The study suggests that the proposed model has the capacity to serve as a roadmap for a smooth IS adoption by facilitating organizational learning and change.Research limitations/implications – The study has not been tested empirically.Originality/value – ...",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/39de989b8e8a8d66617d4e35e8c7d310aab2a852,True
Information Systems and Healthcare XXXIII: An Institutional Theory Perspective on Physician Adoption of Electronic Health Records,"With the recent legislation providing financial incentives to physicians who acquire electronic health record systems, we will be afforded an opportunity to study incentivized adoption of technology coupled with the threat of future penalties for non-adoption. This research uses institutional theory to propose factors that are expected to influence the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) by independent physician practices in the coming years. The study presents a model describing the role of coercive, mimetic, and normative forces on adoption intent. Payer incentives/penalties as well as dominant healthcare delivery partners will exert coercive pressures on physician practices. Additionally, since physicians identify with their own specialties, it is expected that they will also be subject to mimetic forces resulting from successful adoption by similar specialists, particularly given their concerns about expected benefits from these systems. Finally, normative forces resulting from the successful interoperation of electronic health records among regional providers should influence physician adoption. The ability to partner with other physicians and healthcare providers or vendors adopting the same system should increase individual practice adoption intent in the presence of coercive, mimetic, and/or normative forces.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/53c8dcdebc2f52021f3667e828544c304cfb9c94,True

"The role of UTAUT, DOI, perceived technology security and game elements in internet banking adoption","Purpose The increasing innovation and urgent need of up-to-date and convenient information systems have gained high importance in financial sector. Several banks have deployed internet banking in order to reduce cost while improving customer services. Therefore, the growth of internet banking is limited and in many cases fallen short of expectations. The purpose of this paper is to develop an integrated model that combines technology, innovative and environmental factors altogether in order to understand customer’s intention to adopt, and intention to recommend internet banking in social networks. Design/methodology/approach In all, 398 valid responses were collected from customers of commercial banks, using convenience sampling approach. Data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling. Findings The findings show that integrated model has good explanatory power (78.3 percent) to predict customer’s intention to adopt internet banking. Findings also revealed that the interaction effect of gamification between user’s intention to adopt and user’s intention to recommend internet banking will be stronger when gamification effect is higher. Importance performance matrix analysis (IPMA) revealed that innovativeness and perceived technology security were the most important factors in order to determine user’s intention with regard to adoption of internet banking. Practical implications For policy-makers, it is suggested that they should focus on innovative characteristics and must ensure the possible environment for carrying out internet banking transaction. Advertising about new technology with adequate information may produce positive influence on user’s intention. Enjoyable internet banking website with reward system will help to improve user’s intention to adopt and intention to recommend internet banking with others, thus developers should introduce game features on internet banking website.

Metaverse system adoption in education: a systematic literature review,"The evaluation of information systems (IS) models, which are employed to research the adoption or acceptance of metaverse systems, is thought to be a subject of major significance. Studying the adoption or acceptability of the metaverse system is not a recent study area, and many academics have taken on the task. We should be acquainted with the leading IS models used in this study trend to assess these models and give academics a comprehensive understanding of this study trend. The primary goal of this research, in contrast to previous reviews, is to systematically evaluate the metaverse research in education from the viewpoint of IS theories/models to offer a thorough pointer that might help the scholars to carry out additional research in metaverse acceptance. A total of 41 research that was published between 2011 and 2022 were examined in the present systematic review. The main study results showed that the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is recognized as the most widely used model in forecasting people’s intentions to uphold the metaverse system. Furthermore, it was discovered that SmartPLS (PLS-SEM) is a typical tool for validating metaverse models. In addition, the key research purpose covered in the bulk of the reviewed research is to study how students adopt or accept the metaverse system and the technology that supports it. Additionally, most of the research that was gathered was done in China, Taiwan, and the USA, accordingly. Additionally, in most of the evaluated research, it was discovered that university students were the primary respondents concerning data acquisition.

User Acceptance of Hedonic Information Systems,"This paper studies the differences in user acceptance models for productivity-oriented (or utilitarian) and pleasure-oriented (or hedonic) information systems. Hedonic information systems aim to provide self-fulfilling rather than instrumental value to the user, are strongly connected to home and leisure activities, focus on the fun-aspect of using information systems, and encourage prolonged rather than productive use. The paper reports a cross-sectional survey on the usage intentions for one hedonic information system. Analysis of this sample supports the hypotheses that perceived enjoyment and perceived ease of use are stronger determinants of intentions to use than perceived usefulness. The paper concludes that the hedonic nature of an information system is an important boundary condition to the validity of the technology acceptance model. Specifically, perceived usefulness loses its dominant predictive value in favor of ease of use and enjoyment.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fe7789110de0535f0bcfb3755a737e4b779975b1,True
Enhancing PLS-SEM-Enabled Research with ANN and IPMA: Research Study of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems’ Acceptance Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM),"PLS-SEM has been used recently more and more often in studies researching critical factors influencing the acceptance and use of information systems, especially when the technology acceptance model (TAM) is implemented. TAM has proved to be the most promising model for researching different viewpoints regarding information technologies, tools/applications, and the acceptance and use of information systems by the employees who act as the end-users in companies. However, the use of advanced PLS-SEM techniques for testing the extended TAM research models for the acceptance of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems is scarce. The present research aims to fill this gap and aims to show how PLS-SEM results can be enhanced by advanced techniques: artificial neural network analysis (ANN) and Importance–Performance Matrix Analysis (IPMA). ANN was used in this research study to overcome the limitations of PLS-SEM regarding the linear relationships in the model. IPMA was used in evaluating the importance and performance of factors/drivers in the SEM. From the methodological point of view, results show that the research approach with ANN artificial intelligence complements the results of PLS-SEM while allowing the capture of nonlinear relationships between the variables of the model and the determination of the relative importance of each factor studied. On other hand, IPMA enables the identification of factors with relatively low performance but relatively high importance in shaping dependent variables.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cfb5781b02682bdd49bd367d6e2fc633a95ba128,True
Understanding Technology Acceptance of Government Information Systems from Employees' Perspective,"The purpose of this paper is to test the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) in the government-to-government environment and determine the influence of different moderating factors of technology acceptance by government employees.

Information Technology to the Rescue? Explaining the Acceptance of Emergency Response Information Systems by Firefighters,"Improving the efficacy of emergency responses with digital means is receiving increasing attention. Currently, several innovative information technologies and systems are being developed to raise the situation awareness of first responders like firefighters. Among them, emergency response information systems (ERIS) appear to provide a particularly promising platform, which helps to gather, analyze, and share relevant information during emergencies. However, the conditions under which firefighters accept or reject such systems remain unclear. Existing theories explain the acceptance of information technologies only on a general level that does not consider the specific usage constraints existing in the firefighter domain. To fill this literature gap, we propose a detailed, domain-specific acceptance model with factors that explain the acceptance of ERIS by firefighters. It combines findings of the user satisfaction and the technology acceptance literature and was developed based on the input of 82 domain experts. An evaluation of the acceptance model in a survey with 212 firefighters from Germany indicates that it is effective in predicting a firefighter's intention to use an ERIS. The identified acceptance factors provide guidance for the design and evaluation of ERIS, enabling the so far mostly theoretical benefits of ERIS to be transferred into practical applications more effectively.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c7d5016695adff4fba96dd32f8b698a37d5d7fa3,True
"The Use of a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to Predict Patients’ Usage of a Personal Health Record System: The Role of Security, Privacy, and Usability","Personal health records (PHR) systems are designed to ensure that individuals have access and control over their health information and to support them in being active participants rather than passive ones in their healthcare process. Yet, PHR systems have not yet been widely adopted or used by consumers despite their benefits. For these advantages to be realized, adoption of the system is necessary. In this study, we examined how self-determination of health management influences individuals’ intention to implement a PHR system, i.e., their ability to actively manage their health. Using an extended technology acceptance model (TAM), the researchers developed and empirically tested a model explaining public adoption of PHRs. In total, 389 Saudi Arabian respondents were surveyed in a quantitative cross-sectional design. The hypotheses were analysed using structural equation modelling–partial least squares (SEM-PLS4). Results indicate that PHR system usage was influenced by three major factors: perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived usefulness (PU), and security towards intention to use. PHR PEOU and PHR intention to use were also found to be moderated by privacy, whereas usability positively moderated PHR PEOU and PHR intention to use and negatively moderated PHR PU and PHR intention to use. For the first time, this study examined the use of personal health records in Saudi Arabia, including the extension of the TAM model as well as development of a context-driven model that examines the relationship between privacy, security, usability, and the use of PHRs. Furthermore, this study fills a gap in the literature regarding the moderating effects of privacy influence on PEOU and intention to use. Further, the moderating effects of usability on the relationship between PEOU, PU, and intention to use.

The Application of Acceptance Models to Human Resource Information Systems: A Literature Review,"Technology acceptance by users has been extensively studied in recent years in various fields such as technologies for learning, e-commerce, and business technologies. This review focuses specifically on Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS) and its acceptance by users. Given their widespread use in organisations, HRIS acceptance has been researched but not synthesised in any way. This article aims to review the effectiveness of the classical TAM and UTAUT models commonly used for new technologies and to identify the variables added to these models to better predict HRIS acceptance by employees. It also highlights the importance of the human-machine-organisation relationship to contribute to the understanding of HRIS acceptance in professional environments. This review confirms the effectiveness of the TAM and UTAUT models and proposes to develop them by (a) variables reffering to technological characteristics (security, system response time, and the data quality implemented in the system), (b) user satisfaction with the system, and (c) organisational variables (expected role of the HR department). The discussion focuses on the retroaction possibilities between the different Human-Machine-Organisation relation levels.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3b588b8c87dba4ec87628c30c90957c88440242b,True
Trends on Using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for Online Learning: A Bibliometric and Content Analysis,"The technology acceptance model (TAM) is an information systems model that models how consumers use and accept technology. Scholars have implemented TAM widely to examine the effectiveness and ease of use of online learning. Therefore, this analysis comprehensively analyses TAM’s role in accepting online learning platforms by conducting bibliometric and content analysis based on the PRISMA framework. Insights into technology acceptance models were determined by bibliometrics analysis with VosViewer and content analysis. Methods: This study expanded all research from 2002 to 2020. A sum of 120 publications was analysed in January 2022 as documented in the Scopus database after applying the including and excluding criteria in addition to the manual evaluation. Results: This review’s findings identified the most compelling subjects covered by the journal. Most prolific countries, educational institutions, Journals, and authors were identified. Additionally, the results demonstrate several significant models for technology acceptance; several online learning environments were outlined (MOOC, Moodle, E-learning, flipped learning, and blended learning). Conclusion: The research presents a roadmap for potential researchers, concentrating on critical areas where success is possible. However, more research is required to utilize the TAM model and incorporate different online learning environments.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10150ee05e073ba07905644a421e1df615ca577a,True
Machines that feel: behavioral determinants of attitude towards affect recognition technology—upgrading technology acceptance theory with the mindsponge model,"The rise of emotional AI signals a new era in human-machine relations where intelligent machines not only feel but also feed on human emotions as statistical fodder with the goal of reshaping our behavior. Unlike many smart technologies, emotion-recognition systems sense, monitor, harvest and analyze data extracted from a person’s non-conscious or psycho-physical state, often without their knowledge or consent. As a far more invasive manner of surveillance capitalism, the technological adoption of emotional AI is problematized by a myriad of legal, ethical, cultural, and scientific issues. To better understand the behavioral factors determining an individual’s attitude towards this emerging technology, we first identify five major tensions that may impinge on adoption. Second, we extend the Technological Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989 ) model with insights from the mindsponge model of information filtering (Vuong and Napier, 2015 ) along with quantitative affordances offered by the Bayesian computational approach. Our analysis was conducted based on a multi-national dataset surveying perceptions of 1015 young adults (age 18–27) regarding emotional AI applications and their socio-cultural characteristics such as income, region, religiosity, and home country politics. These characteristics are fed into our Bayesian multi-level models as varying intercepts so that we can systematically measure and compare the effects of various behavioral determinants on the attitudes of respondents towards non-conscious data harvesting by government and private sector actors. Critically, this study finds respondents who feel more familiar with, and perceive more utilities in AI technologies, as well as rate themselves as more restrained from heated arguments on social media, feel less threatened by the practice of non-conscious data harvesting by both government and private sector actors. Our findings offer a fertile platform for further exploration of the intersection between psychology, culture, and emotion-recognition technologies as well as important insights for policymakers wishing to ensure design and regulation of the technology serve the best interests of society.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b5cc844c579179c30db30a95104e5d2aa3c7e711,True
"User Acceptance of Information Technology: System Characteristics, User Perceptions and Behavioral Impacts","Abstract Lack of user acceptance has long been an impediment to the success of new information systems. The present research addresses why users accept or reject information systems and how user acceptance is affected by system design features. The technology acceptance model (TAM) specifies the causal relationships between system design features, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude toward using, and actual usage behavior. Attitude theory from psychology provides the rationale for hypothesized model relationships, and validated measures were used to operationalize model variables. A field study of 112 users regarding two end-user systems was conducted to test the hypothesized model. TAM fully mediated the effects of system characteristics on usage behavior, accounting for 36% of the variance in usage. Perhaps the most striking finding was that perceived usefulness was 50% more influential than ease of use in determining usage, underscoring the importance of incorporating the appropriate functional capabilities in new systems. Overall, TAM provides an informative representation of the mechanisms by which design choices influence user acceptance, and should therefore be helpful in applied contexts for forecasting and evaluating user acceptance of information technology. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/89662b1305051451a9ab3ece083961921092a063,True

“Assessment of the social influence and facilitating conditions that support nurses’ adoption of hospital electronic information management systems (HEIMS) in Ghana using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model”,"BackgroundHospital electronic information management systems (HEIMS) are widely used in Ghana, and hence its performance must be carefully assessed. Nurses as clinical health personnel are the largest cluster of hospital staff and are the pillar of healthcare delivery. Therefore, they play a crucial role in the adoption and assessment of HEIMSs in Ghana. This report sought to assess the “Social Influence” (SI) and “Facilitating Conditions” (FC) that support Nurses’ Acceptance of HEIMS in Ghana using the “Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology” (UTAUT) model.MethodsThis study applied a non-experimental survey design. An electronic platform questionnaire on smartphones was used to collect data on 660 nurses. Statistically, AMOS Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) version 22.0 was employed to examine the research model.Results“Behavioral Intention” (BI) to HEIMS use was significantly predicted by SI and FC (p < 0.001). Notably, both SI and FC had an influence on nurses’ use behavior (UB) with behavioral intention (BI) as the mediator, which explains a total of 42.1% variance in the intention of nurses to use HEIMS. Likewise, UB of HEIMS was also significantly predicted by SI (R2 = 43.2) and BI (R2 = 0.39.6) with both constructs explaining a total of 51.7% of the variance in nurses’ acceptance to use HEIMS.ConclusionNurses’ adoption of HEIMS in terms of the UB was influenced by SI and BI, whiles SI and FC had the strongest influence on BI (serving as mediator) of UB to adopt and use HEIMS among the nurses in Ghanaian hospitals.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f993f5b2c794ba8caf2bf1a532b4d6f00b8727e,True
Factors that affect acceptance and use of information systems within the Maritime industry in developing countries,"Purpose Although information and communication technology has become a significant driver for organizational efficiency and effectiveness, there is inadequate empirical research on technology acceptance in the maritime industry especially in developing countries. Literature on how behavior and attitude influence technology acceptance is non-existent. This study therefore aims to augment existing literature on technology acceptance in developing countries with particular emphasis on the maritime industry. Design/methodology/approach The study extended the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model to investigate the factors that affect the acceptance and use of INTTRA: a multi-carrier booking and shipping system designed to facilitate ocean trade worldwide. Responses from 198 subjects, collected through a questionnaire, were analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling. Findings The research model confirmed significant influences of performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, anxiety and attitude towards use on users’ intention to use INTTRA. In contrast, social influence, effort expectancy and self-efficacy did not significantly influence intention to use. Although these findings confirm some proposed relationships in the UTAUT model, it contradicted the cultural dimension argument that developing countries with higher degrees of femininity pay less attention to performance and high attention to social influence. Research limitations/implications The study contributes to knowledge in the area of information systems and technology acceptance in developing countries. Particularly, it seeks to expand literature on adoption within the maritime industry. The study is limited to the sample used for the study, as it used participants from only one country. However, the findings are not generalized for the entire maritime industry but rather Ghana. Originality/value The originality of the study is derived from the provision of literature on adoption within the maritime industry in developing countries. It also provided evidence that challenges existing knowledge on characteristics of countries that exhibits high level of femininity culture as proposed by Hofstede.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aa80c0f8b2a4d226ee7b52df9e69437bd9e87643,True
Cloud-based accounting information systems usage and its impact on Jordanian SMEs’ performance: the post-COVID-19 perspective,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the factors influencing the usage of cloud-based accounting information systems (AIS) in the crisis era (i.e. the COVID-19 pandemic) by expanding the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) with new related critical factors. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research approach based on a cross-sectional online questionnaire was used for collecting empirical data from 438 potential and current users of cloud-based AIS. Structural equation modeling based on analysis of a moment structures 25.0 was applied in the data analysis. Findings The outcome of the structural path revealed that performance expectancy, social motivation, COVID-19 risk (COV-19 PR) and trust (TR) were significantly influencing users’ behavioral intention (BI) toward using cloud-based AIS and explained 71% of its variance. While, contrary to what is expected, the impact of effort expectancy and perceived security risk (SEC) on BI was insignificant. In addition, BI was revealed to influence the actual usage behaviors and explained 74% of its variance. The outcome factors: communication quality (CQ) and decision quality (DQ) were significantly influenced by the usage of cloud-based AIS. Practical implications The current research would be valuable for small- and medium-sized enterprises officials and policymakers to illustrate the relatively low rates of cloud-based AIS and formulate strategies to boost the acceptance and use of cloud-based AIS by Jordanian users, where cloud-based services are still deemed as an innovation. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the current study is the first academic paper that extends the UTAUT by integrating additional factors: TR, SEC and COV-19 PR. In addition to two outcome variables: CQ and DQ, to study the cloud-based AIS in the Jordanian setting beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The current research contributes to the academic knowledge on information technology information system adoption by considering cloud accounting acceptance and use and integration into the work practices of users through the BIs and actual use of cloud-based AIS in Jordan.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f52853820e449af4699231480979e0e38e1cbbe8,True
An overview of patient acceptance of Health Information Technology in developing countries: a review and conceptual model,"The potential to improve the quality, efficiency, outcomes, patient safety and reduce cost of healthcare by Health Information Technology (HIT) has been established by researchers. But unfortunately HIT systems are not properly utilized or are not widely available. This problem is even more glaring in developing countries. This article presents a review of some available HIT systems in order to assess the level of their presence and the technology used in developing them. Works related to acceptance of HIT systems were also reviewed so as to study the gaps in this area and propose a solution in order to fill the gaps identified. The problems discovered from this review include lack of availability of these systems especially in developing countries, low rate of HIT systems acceptance and insufficient works on patient acceptance of HIT systems. Studying the factors that affect the acceptance of HIT systems by patients and considering the factors while developing the systems will play a significant role in getting over the aforementioned limitations. As Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is one of the most popular models for studying users' perception and acceptance of Information System (IS)/Information Technology (IT), we proposed a conceptual model of HIT acceptance in developing countries based on TAM.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/64bf3ec3a40e756cd7194a25cab442726840210d,True
"Determinants of Perceived Ease of Use: Integrating Control, Intrinsic Motivation, and Emotion into the Technology Acceptance Model","Much previous research has established that perceived ease of use is an important factor influencing user acceptance and usage behavior of information technologies. However, very little research has been conducted to understand how that perception forms and changes over time. The current work presents and tests an anchoring and adjustment-based theoretical model of the determinants of system-specific perceived ease of use. The model proposes control (internal and external--conceptualized as computer self-efficacy and facilitating conditions, respectively), intrinsic motivation (conceptualized as computer playfulness), and emotion (conceptualized as computer anxiety) as anchors that determine early perceptions about the ease of use of a new system. With increasing experience, it is expected that system-specific perceived ease of use, while still anchored to the general beliefs regarding computers and computer use, will adjust to reflect objective usability, perceptions of external control specific to the new system environment, and system-specific perceived enjoyment. The proposed model was tested in three different organizations among 246 employees using three measurements taken over a three-month period. The proposed model was strongly supported at all points of measurement, and explained up to 60% of the variance in system-specific perceived ease of use, which is twice as much as our current understanding. Important theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5837c48dc665b0de393e1de3a9bc1994d5dc3f12,True
Predicting User Intentions: Comparing the Technology Acceptance Model with the Theory of Planned Behavior,"Information systems IS cannot be effective unless they are used. However, people sometimes do not use systems that could potentially increase their performance. This study compares two models that predict an individual's intention to use an IS: the technology acceptance model TAM and the theory of planned behavior TPB. The comparison was designed to be as fair as possible, not favoring one model over the other. Both TAM and TPB predicted intention to use an IS quite well, with TAM having a slight empirical advantage. TAM is easier to apply, but only supplies very general information on users' opinions about a system. TPB provides more specific information that can better guide development.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a3c3c084d4c30cf40e134314a5dcaf66b4019171,True
Applying the Technology Acceptance Model and Flow Theory to Online Consumer Behavior,"In this study, we consider the online consumer as both a shopper and a computer user. We test constructs from information systems (Technology Acceptance Model), marketing (Consumer Behavior), and psychology (Flow and Environmental Psychology) in an integrated theoretical framework of online consumer behavior. Specifically, we examine how emotional and cognitive responses to visiting a Web-based store for the first time can influence online consumers' intention to return and their likelihood to make unplanned purchases. The instrumentation shows reasonably good measurement properties and the constructs are validated as a nomological network.A questionnaire-based empirical study is used to test this nomological network. Results confirm the double identity of the online consumer as a shopper and a computer user because both shopping enjoyment and perceived usefulness of the site strongly predict intention to return. Our results on unplanned purchases are not conclusive. We also test some individual and Web site factors that can affect the consumer's emotional and cognitive responses. Product involvement, Web skills, challenges, and use of value-added search mechanisms all have a significant impact on the Web consumer. The study provides a more rounded, albeit partial, view of the online consumer and is a significant steptowards a better understanding of consumer behavior on the Web. The validated metrics should be of use to researchers and practitioners alike.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a0edefd3f11d8295c986723824684c81a8782c27,True
Investigating a theoretical framework for e-learning technology acceptance,"E-learning has gained recognition and fame in delivering and distributing educational resources, and the same has become possible with the occurrence of Internet and Web technologies. The research seeks to determine the factors that influence students' acceptance of E-learning and to find out the way these factors determine the students' intention to employ E-learning. A theoretical framework was developed based on the technology acceptance model (TAM). To obtain information from the 270 university students who utilized the E-learning system, a questionnaire was formulated. The results revealed that “social influence, perceived enjoyment, self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use” are the strongest and most important predictors in the intention of and students towards E-learning systems. The outcomes offer practical implications for practitioners, lawmakers, and developers in effective E-learning systems implementation to improve ongoing interests and activities of university students in a virtual E-learning atmosphere, valuable recommendations for E-learning practices are given by the research findings, and these may turn out to be as guidelines for the efficient design of E-learning systems.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/333b318fbb81f6730661ea2e9e28cd928fb9bdcd,True
The Acceptance of Using Information Technology for Disaster Risk Management: A Systematic Review,". The numbers of natural disaster events are continuously affecting human and the world economics. For coping with disaster, several sectors try to develop the frameworks, systems, technologies and so on. However, there are little researches focusing on the usage behavior of Information Technology (IT) for disaster risk management (DRM). Therefore, this study investigates the affecting factors on the intention to use IT for mitigating disaster’s impacts. This study conducted a systematic review with the academic researches during 2011-2018. Two important factors from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and others are used in describing individual behavior. In order to investigate the potential factors, the technology platforms are divided into nine types. According to the findings, computer software such as GIS applications are frequently used for simulation and spatial data analysis. Social media is preferred among the first choices during disaster events in order to communicate about situations and damages. Finally, we found five major potential factors which are Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU), information accessibility, social influence, and disaster knowledge. Among them, the most essential one of using IT for disaster management is PU, while PEOU and information accessibility are more important in the web platforms.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/165a82e2791c0c0b9998708e2a9c4284a586f19f,True
Theories Integrated With Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in Online Learning Acceptance and Continuance Intention: A Systematic Review,"Since its inception, Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has been a commonly adopted theory for understanding users’ acceptance of various types of information systems (e.g., online learning systems). Over the years, different information systems theories have been integrated into TAM to further the understanding of users’ intention to accept online learning. To examine the literature, four databases were utilized to discover research articles examining the online learning acceptance and continuance intention of users (e.g., students and teachers). The findings of the systematic review revealed that Task Technology Fit and Theory of Planned Behavior are the most integrated and educationally successful theories into TAM. Meanwhile, course information, satisfaction, perceived usefulness, attitude, system quality, perceived ease of use, and academic performance are the essential drivers for the acceptance or continuance usage of online learning systems. These findings serve as an evidence and reference for educational institutions in developing policies and strategies for the implementation of an online education.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7da468674f85c3cc647de17010ad780292f4f38d,True
A Systematic Review of the Technology Acceptance Model in Health Informatics,"Abstract Background One common model utilized to understand clinical staff and patients' technology adoption is the technology acceptance model (TAM). Objective This article reviews published research on TAM use in health information systems development and implementation with regard to application areas and model extensions after its initial introduction. Method An electronic literature search supplemented by citation searching was conducted on February 2017 of the Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases, yielding a total of 492 references. Upon eliminating duplicates and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 134 articles were retained. These articles were appraised and divided into three categories according to research topic: studies using the original TAM, studies using an extended TAM, and acceptance model comparisons including the TAM. Results The review identified three main information and communication technology (ICT) application areas for the TAM in health services: telemedicine, electronic health records, and mobile applications. The original TAM was found to have been extended to fit dynamic health service environments by integration of components from theoretical frameworks such as the theory of planned behavior and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, as well as by adding variables in specific contextual settings. These variables frequently reflected the concepts subjective norm and self-efficacy, but also compatibility, experience, training, anxiety, habit, and facilitators were considered. Conclusion Telemedicine applications were between 1999 and 2017, the ICT application area most frequently studied using the TAM, implying that acceptance of this technology was a major challenge when exploiting ICT to develop health service organizations during this period. A majority of the reviewed articles reported extensions of the original TAM, suggesting that no optimal TAM version for use in health services has been established. Although the review results indicate a continuous progress, there are still areas that can be expanded and improved to increase the predictive performance of the TAM.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/43630ab6dd1efc3d998de561a1d096abb685c0ab,True
Direct and Indirect Associations of Personality With Audiovisual Technology Acceptance Through General Self-Efficacy,"Increasing consensus among information systems researchers suggests that personality accounts for the effective use of several technologies, yet less is known about the process through which personality affects user perceptions of technology acceptance. This study, therefore, examined whether personality is associated with student perceptions of audiovisual technology acceptance, and whether general self-efficacy mediates this association. In total, 244 students completed an online survey including measures of personality, general self-efficacy, and perceptions of audiovisual technology acceptance. Canonical correlation uncovered significant associations between personality and student beliefs about technology use. Results further revealed that general self-efficacy fully mediated the effects of openness to experience and neuroticism on Perceived Ease of Use, whereas the association between agreeableness and Perceived Usefulness was partially mediated by self-efficacy beliefs. The fact that personality influences students’ perceptions of technology acceptance both directly and indirectly should not remain unnoticed, especially when designing intervention programs to enhance their academic performance.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/749e48cb06c3fd550a22a281fecf23c8a62ae654,True
A Theoretical Integration of User Satisfaction and Technology Acceptance,"In general, perceptions of information systems (IS) success have been investigated within two primary research streams--the user satisfaction literature and the technology acceptance literature. These two approaches have been developed in parallel and have not been reconciled or integrated. This paper develops an integrated research model that distinguishes beliefs and attitudes about the system (i.e., object-based beliefs and attitudes) from beliefs and attitudes about using the system (i.e., behavioral beliefs and attitudes) to build the theoretical logic that links the user satisfaction and technology acceptance literature. The model is then tested using a sample of 465 users from seven different organizations who completed a survey regarding their use of data warehousing software. The proposed model was supported, providing preliminary evidence that the two perspectives can and should be integrated. The integrated model helps build the bridge from design and implementation decisions to system characteristics (a core strength of the user satisfaction literature) to the prediction of usage (a core strength of the technology acceptance literature).",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/37d79ff18f78e29146d89834614d4d64807f4ba6,True
How nostalgic feelings impact Pokémon Go players – integrating childhood brand nostalgia into the technology acceptance theory,"ABSTRACT The augmented reality smartphone game Pokémon Go is one of the biggest commercial successes in the last years, posing the question concerning the factors contributing to the game’s success. An apparent distinction to other games is the strong brand Pokémon. We derive a research model based on the established theory of technology acceptance, which includes an established construct for nostalgic feelings – childhood brand nostalgia – and theorise on how it is related to beliefs about technology characteristics and the intention to play the game. For this purpose, we adapt one of the most prominent technology acceptance models for the consumer context and for hedonic information systems, the UTAUT2 model. Based on our model, we conduct a study with 418 active German players aged between 18 and 35. Our results indicate that the effect of childhood brand nostalgia on behavioural intention is fully mediated by the belief constructs. Thus, nostalgic feelings about Pokémon influence the intention of users through altering beliefs concerning Pokémon. We include nostalgic feelings in a technology acceptance model for the first time, therefore contributing to the theoretical advance in the IS domain. The results can be used to enhance the technology acceptance of newly designed products.",IMP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2988f3c9994f078791c71d68c847d0e69fa63f12,True
