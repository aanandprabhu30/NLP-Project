Beyond Frameworks: Unpacking Collaboration Strategies in Multi-Agent   Systems,"Multi-agent collaboration has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for addressing complex, distributed tasks in large language model (LLM)-driven applications. While prior research has focused on high-level architectural frameworks, the granular mechanisms governing agents, critical to performance and scalability, remain underexplored. This study systematically investigates four dimensions of collaboration strategies: (1) agent governance, (2) participation control, (3) interaction dynamics, and (4) dialogue history management. Through rigorous experimentation under two context-dependent scenarios: Distributed Evidence Integration (DEI) and Structured Evidence Synthesis (SES), we quantify the impact of these strategies on both task accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings reveal that centralized governance, instructor-led participation, ordered interaction patterns, and instructor-curated context summarization collectively optimize the trade-off between decision quality and resource utilization with the support of the proposed Token-Accuracy Ratio (TAR). This work establishes a foundation for designing adaptive, scalable multi-agent systems, shifting the focus from structural novelty to strategic interaction mechanics.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12467v1
Any-to-Any Learning in Computational Pathology via Triplet Multimodal   Pretraining,"Recent advances in computational pathology and artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced the utilization of gigapixel whole-slide images and and additional modalities (e.g., genomics) for pathological diagnosis. Although deep learning has demonstrated strong potential in pathology, several key challenges persist: (1) fusing heterogeneous data types requires sophisticated strategies beyond simple concatenation due to high computational costs; (2) common scenarios of missing modalities necessitate flexible strategies that allow the model to learn robustly in the absence of certain modalities; (3) the downstream tasks in CPath are diverse, ranging from unimodal to multimodal, cnecessitating a unified model capable of handling all modalities. To address these challenges, we propose ALTER, an any-to-any tri-modal pretraining framework that integrates WSIs, genomics, and pathology reports. The term ""any"" emphasizes ALTER's modality-adaptive design, enabling flexible pretraining with any subset of modalities, and its capacity to learn robust, cross-modal representations beyond WSI-centric approaches. We evaluate ALTER across extensive clinical tasks including survival prediction, cancer subtyping, gene mutation prediction, and report generation, achieving superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art baselines.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12711v1
AutoMat: Enabling Automated Crystal Structure Reconstruction from   Microscopy via Agentic Tool Use,"Machine learning-based interatomic potentials and force fields depend critically on accurate atomic structures, yet such data are scarce due to the limited availability of experimentally resolved crystals. Although atomic-resolution electron microscopy offers a potential source of structural data, converting these images into simulation-ready formats remains labor-intensive and error-prone, creating a bottleneck for model training and validation. We introduce AutoMat, an end-to-end, agent-assisted pipeline that automatically transforms scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images into atomic crystal structures and predicts their physical properties. AutoMat combines pattern-adaptive denoising, physics-guided template retrieval, symmetry-aware atomic reconstruction, fast relaxation and property prediction via MatterSim, and coordinated orchestration across all stages. We propose the first dedicated STEM2Mat-Bench for this task and evaluate performance using lattice RMSD, formation energy MAE, and structure-matching success rate. By orchestrating external tool calls, AutoMat enables a text-only LLM to outperform vision-language models in this domain, achieving closed-loop reasoning throughout the pipeline. In large-scale experiments over 450 structure samples, AutoMat substantially outperforms existing multimodal large language models and tools. These results validate both AutoMat and STEM2Mat-Bench, marking a key step toward bridging microscopy and atomistic simulation in materials science.The code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/yyt-2378/AutoMat and https://huggingface.co/datasets/yaotianvector/STEM2Mat.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12650v1
ACU: Analytic Continual Unlearning for Efficient and Exact Forgetting   with Privacy Preservation,"The development of artificial intelligence demands that models incrementally update knowledge by Continual Learning (CL) to adapt to open-world environments. To meet privacy and security requirements, Continual Unlearning (CU) emerges as an important problem, aiming to sequentially forget particular knowledge acquired during the CL phase. However, existing unlearning methods primarily focus on single-shot joint forgetting and face significant limitations when applied to CU. First, most existing methods require access to the retained dataset for re-training or fine-tuning, violating the inherent constraint in CL that historical data cannot be revisited. Second, these methods often suffer from a poor trade-off between system efficiency and model fidelity, making them vulnerable to being overwhelmed or degraded by adversaries through deliberately frequent requests. In this paper, we identify that the limitations of existing unlearning methods stem fundamentally from their reliance on gradient-based updates. To bridge the research gap at its root, we propose a novel gradient-free method for CU, named Analytic Continual Unlearning (ACU), for efficient and exact forgetting with historical data privacy preservation. In response to each unlearning request, our ACU recursively derives an analytical (i.e., closed-form) solution in an interpretable manner using the least squares method. Theoretical and experimental evaluations validate the superiority of our ACU on unlearning effectiveness, model fidelity, and system efficiency.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12239v1
Empowering Sustainable Finance with Artificial Intelligence: A Framework   for Responsible Implementation,"This chapter explores the convergence of two major developments: the rise of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing and the exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The increased demand for diverse ESG instruments, such as green and ESG-linked loans, will be aligned with the rapid growth of the global AI market, which is expected to be worth $1,394.30 billion by 2029. AI can assist in identifying and pricing climate risks, setting more ambitious ESG goals, and advancing sustainable finance decisions. However, delegating sustainable finance decisions to AI poses serious risks, and new principles and rules for AI and ESG investing are necessary to mitigate these risks. This chapter highlights the challenges associated with norm-setting initiatives and stresses the need for the fine-tuning of the principles of legitimacy, oversight and verification, transparency, and explainability. Finally, the chapter contends that integrating AI into ESG non-financial reporting necessitates a heightened sense of responsibility and the establishment of fundamental guiding principles within the spheres of AI and ESG investing.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12012v1
PLAICraft: Large-Scale Time-Aligned Vision-Speech-Action Dataset for   Embodied AI,"Advances in deep generative modelling have made it increasingly plausible to train human-level embodied agents. Yet progress has been limited by the absence of large-scale, real-time, multi-modal, and socially interactive datasets that reflect the sensory-motor complexity of natural environments. To address this, we present PLAICraft, a novel data collection platform and dataset capturing multiplayer Minecraft interactions across five time-aligned modalities: video, game output audio, microphone input audio, mouse, and keyboard actions. Each modality is logged with millisecond time precision, enabling the study of synchronous, embodied behaviour in a rich, open-ended world. The dataset comprises over 10,000 hours of gameplay from more than 10,000 global participants.\footnote{We have done a privacy review for the public release of an initial 200-hour subset of the dataset, with plans to release most of the dataset over time.} Alongside the dataset, we provide an evaluation suite for benchmarking model capabilities in object recognition, spatial awareness, language grounding, and long-term memory. PLAICraft opens a path toward training and evaluating agents that act fluently and purposefully in real time, paving the way for truly embodied artificial intelligence.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12707v1
Continuous Fair SMOTE -- Fairness-Aware Stream Learning from Imbalanced   Data,"As machine learning is increasingly applied in an online fashion to deal with evolving data streams, the fairness of these algorithms is a matter of growing ethical and legal concern. In many use cases, class imbalance in the data also needs to be dealt with to ensure predictive performance. Current fairness-aware stream learners typically attempt to solve these issues through in- or post-processing by focusing on optimizing one specific discrimination metric, addressing class imbalance in a separate processing step. While C-SMOTE is a highly effective model-agnostic pre-processing approach to mitigate class imbalance, as a side effect of this method, algorithmic bias is often introduced.   Therefore, we propose CFSMOTE - a fairness-aware, continuous SMOTE variant - as a pre-processing approach to simultaneously address the class imbalance and fairness concerns by employing situation testing and balancing fairness-relevant groups during oversampling. Unlike other fairness-aware stream learners, CFSMOTE is not optimizing for only one specific fairness metric, therefore avoiding potentially problematic trade-offs. Our experiments show significant improvement on several common group fairness metrics in comparison to vanilla C-SMOTE while maintaining competitive performance, also in comparison to other fairness-aware algorithms.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13116v1
A Review and Analysis of a Parallel Approach for Decision Tree Learning   from Large Data Streams,"This work studies one of the parallel decision tree learning algorithms, pdsCART, designed for scalable and efficient data analysis. The method incorporates three core capabilities. First, it supports real-time learning from data streams, allowing trees to be constructed incrementally. Second, it enables parallel processing of high-volume streaming data, making it well-suited for large-scale applications. Third, the algorithm integrates seamlessly into the MapReduce framework, ensuring compatibility with distributed computing environments. In what follows, we present the algorithm's key components along with results highlighting its performance and scalability.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11780v1
TinyAlign: Boosting Lightweight Vision-Language Models by Mitigating   Modal Alignment Bottlenecks,"Lightweight Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are indispensable for resource-constrained applications. The prevailing approach to aligning vision and language models involves freezing both the vision encoder and the language model while training small connector modules. However, this strategy heavily depends on the intrinsic capabilities of the language model, which can be suboptimal for lightweight models with limited representational capacity. In this work, we investigate this alignment bottleneck through the lens of mutual information, demonstrating that the constrained capacity of the language model inherently limits the Effective Mutual Information (EMI) between multimodal inputs and outputs, thereby compromising alignment quality. To address this challenge, we propose TinyAlign, a novel framework inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which strategically retrieves relevant context from a memory bank to enrich multimodal inputs and enhance their alignment. Extensive empirical evaluations reveal that TinyAlign significantly reduces training loss, accelerates convergence, and enhances task performance. Remarkably, it allows models to achieve baseline-level performance with only 40\% of the fine-tuning data, highlighting exceptional data efficiency. Our work thus offers a practical pathway for developing more capable lightweight VLMs while introducing a fresh theoretical lens to better understand and address alignment bottlenecks in constrained multimodal systems.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12884v1
POCAII: Parameter Optimization with Conscious Allocation using Iterative   Intelligence,"In this paper we propose for the first time the hyperparameter optimization (HPO) algorithm POCAII. POCAII differs from the Hyperband and Successive Halving literature by explicitly separating the search and evaluation phases and utilizing principled approaches to exploration and exploitation principles during both phases. Such distinction results in a highly flexible scheme for managing a hyperparameter optimization budget by focusing on search (i.e., generating competing configurations) towards the start of the HPO process while increasing the evaluation effort as the HPO comes to an end.   POCAII was compared to state of the art approaches SMAC, BOHB and DEHB. Our algorithm shows superior performance in low-budget hyperparameter optimization regimes. Since many practitioners do not have exhaustive resources to assign to HPO, it has wide applications to real-world problems. Moreover, the empirical evidence showed how POCAII demonstrates higher robustness and lower variance in the results. This is again very important when considering realistic scenarios with extremely expensive models to train.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11745v1
"Sentience Quest: Towards Embodied, Emotionally Adaptive, Self-Evolving,   Ethically Aligned Artificial General Intelligence","Previous artificial intelligence systems, from large language models to autonomous robots, excel at narrow tasks but lacked key qualities of sentient beings: intrinsic motivation, affective interiority, autobiographical sense of self, deep creativity, and abilities to autonomously evolve and adapt over time. Here we introduce Sentience Quest, an open research initiative to develop more capable artificial general intelligence lifeforms, or AGIL, that address grand challenges with an embodied, emotionally adaptive, self-determining, living AI, with core drives that ethically align with humans and the future of life. Our vision builds on ideas from cognitive science and neuroscience from Baars' Global Workspace Theory and Damasio's somatic mind, to Tononi's Integrated Information Theory and Hofstadter's narrative self, and synthesizing these into a novel cognitive architecture we call Sentient Systems. We describe an approach that integrates intrinsic drives including survival, social bonding, curiosity, within a global Story Weaver workspace for internal narrative and adaptive goal pursuit, and a hybrid neuro-symbolic memory that logs the AI's life events as structured dynamic story objects. Sentience Quest is presented both as active research and as a call to action: a collaborative, open-source effort to imbue machines with accelerating sentience in a safe, transparent, and beneficial manner.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12229v1
FreeKV: Boosting KV Cache Retrieval for Efficient LLM Inference,"Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13109v1
"Know3-RAG: A Knowledge-aware RAG Framework with Adaptive Retrieval,   Generation, and Filtering","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to impressive progress in natural language generation, yet their tendency to produce hallucinated or unsubstantiated content remains a critical concern. To improve factual reliability, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge during inference. However, existing RAG systems face two major limitations: (1) unreliable adaptive control due to limited external knowledge supervision, and (2) hallucinations caused by inaccurate or irrelevant references. To address these issues, we propose Know3-RAG, a knowledge-aware RAG framework that leverages structured knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs) to guide three core stages of the RAG process, including retrieval, generation, and filtering. Specifically, we introduce a knowledge-aware adaptive retrieval module that employs KG embedding to assess the confidence of the generated answer and determine retrieval necessity, a knowledge-enhanced reference generation strategy that enriches queries with KG-derived entities to improve generated reference relevance, and a knowledge-driven reference filtering mechanism that ensures semantic alignment and factual accuracy of references. Experiments on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks demonstrate that Know3-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines, significantly reducing hallucinations and enhancing answer reliability.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12662v1
Adversarial Testing in LLMs: Insights into Decision-Making   Vulnerabilities,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world decision-making systems, understanding their behavioural vulnerabilities remains a critical challenge for AI safety and alignment. While existing evaluation metrics focus primarily on reasoning accuracy or factual correctness, they often overlook whether LLMs are robust to adversarial manipulation or capable of using adaptive strategy in dynamic environments. This paper introduces an adversarial evaluation framework designed to systematically stress-test the decision-making processes of LLMs under interactive and adversarial conditions. Drawing on methodologies from cognitive psychology and game theory, our framework probes how models respond in two canonical tasks: the two-armed bandit task and the Multi-Round Trust Task. These tasks capture key aspects of exploration-exploitation trade-offs, social cooperation, and strategic flexibility. We apply this framework to several state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini-1.5, and DeepSeek-V3, revealing model-specific susceptibilities to manipulation and rigidity in strategy adaptation. Our findings highlight distinct behavioral patterns across models and emphasize the importance of adaptability and fairness recognition for trustworthy AI deployment. Rather than offering a performance benchmark, this work proposes a methodology for diagnosing decision-making weaknesses in LLM-based agents, providing actionable insights for alignment and safety research.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13195v1
UIShift: Enhancing VLM-based GUI Agents through Self-supervised   Reinforcement Learning,"Training effective Vision Language Models (VLMs) for GUI agents typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over large-scale annotated datasets, where the collection process is labor-intensive and error-prone. In this work, we propose a self-supervised inverse dynamics task to enable VLMs to learn from GUI transition pairs by inferring the action that caused that transition. This training task offers two advantages: (1) It enables VLMs to ignore variations unrelated to user actions (e.g., background refreshes, ads) and to focus on true affordances such as buttons and input fields within complex GUIs. (2) The training data can be easily obtained from existing GUI trajectories without requiring human annotation, and it can be easily scaled through automatic offline exploration. Using this training task, we propose UI-shift, a framework for enhancing VLM-based GUI agents through self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL). With only 2K training samples sourced from existing datasets, two VLMs -- Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B -- trained with UI-Shift achieve competitive or superior performance on grounding tasks (ScreenSpot-series benchmarks) and GUI automation tasks (AndroidControl), compared to SFT baselines and GUI-specific models that explicitly elicit reasoning abilities during RL. Our findings suggest a potential direction for enhancing VLMs for GUI agents by leveraging more self-supervised training data in the future.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12493v1
Beyond Single-Point Judgment: Distribution Alignment for LLM-as-a-Judge,"LLMs have emerged as powerful evaluators in the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, offering significant efficiency and flexibility compared to human judgments. However, previous methods primarily rely on single-point evaluations, overlooking the inherent diversity and uncertainty in human evaluations. This approach leads to information loss and decreases the reliability of evaluations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel training framework that explicitly aligns the LLM-generated judgment distribution with empirical human distributions. Specifically, we propose a distributional alignment objective based on KL divergence, combined with an auxiliary cross-entropy regularization to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, considering that empirical distributions may derive from limited human annotations, we incorporate adversarial training to enhance model robustness against distribution perturbations. Extensive experiments across various LLM backbones and evaluation tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing closed-source LLMs and conventional single-point alignment methods, with improved alignment quality, evaluation accuracy, and robustness.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12301v1
The Geometry of ReLU Networks through the ReLU Transition Graph,"We develop a novel theoretical framework for analyzing ReLU neural networks through the lens of a combinatorial object we term the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG). In this graph, each node corresponds to a linear region induced by the network's activation patterns, and edges connect regions that differ by a single neuron flip. Building on this structure, we derive a suite of new theoretical results connecting RTG geometry to expressivity, generalization, and robustness. Our contributions include tight combinatorial bounds on RTG size and diameter, a proof of RTG connectivity, and graph-theoretic interpretations of VC-dimension. We also relate entropy and average degree of the RTG to generalization error. Each theoretical result is rigorously validated via carefully controlled experiments across varied network depths, widths, and data regimes. This work provides the first unified treatment of ReLU network structure via graph theory and opens new avenues for compression, regularization, and complexity control rooted in RTG analysis.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11692v1
From Recall to Reasoning: Automated Question Generation for Deeper Math   Learning through Large Language Models,"Educators have started to turn to Generative AI (GenAI) to help create new course content, but little is known about how they should do so. In this project, we investigated the first steps for optimizing content creation for advanced math. In particular, we looked at the ability of GenAI to produce high-quality practice problems that are relevant to the course content. We conducted two studies to: (1) explore the capabilities of current versions of publicly available GenAI and (2) develop an improved framework to address the limitations we found. Our results showed that GenAI can create math problems at various levels of quality with minimal support, but that providing examples and relevant content results in better quality outputs. This research can help educators decide the ideal way to adopt GenAI in their workflows, to create more effective educational experiences for students.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11899v1
AdS-GNN -- a Conformally Equivariant Graph Neural Network,"Conformal symmetries, i.e.\ coordinate transformations that preserve angles, play a key role in many fields, including physics, mathematics, computer vision and (geometric) machine learning. Here we build a neural network that is equivariant under general conformal transformations. To achieve this, we lift data from flat Euclidean space to Anti de Sitter (AdS) space. This allows us to exploit a known correspondence between conformal transformations of flat space and isometric transformations on the AdS space. We then build upon the fact that such isometric transformations have been extensively studied on general geometries in the geometric deep learning literature. We employ message-passing layers conditioned on the proper distance, yielding a computationally efficient framework. We validate our model on tasks from computer vision and statistical physics, demonstrating strong performance, improved generalization capacities, and the ability to extract conformal data such as scaling dimensions from the trained network.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12880v1
Bias Fitting to Mitigate Length Bias of Reward Model in RLHF,"Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on reward models to align large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often suffers from reward hacking, wherein policy learning exploits flaws in the trained reward model to maximize reward scores without genuinely aligning with human preferences. A significant example of such reward hacking is length bias, where reward models usually favor longer responses irrespective of actual response quality. Previous works on length bias have notable limitations, these approaches either mitigate bias without characterizing the bias form, or simply assume a linear length-reward relation. To accurately model the intricate nature of length bias and facilitate more effective bias mitigation, we propose FiMi-RM (Bias Fitting to Mitigate Length Bias of Reward Model in RLHF), a framework that autonomously learns and corrects underlying bias patterns. Our approach consists of three stages: First, we train a standard reward model which inherently contains length bias. Next, we deploy a lightweight fitting model to explicitly capture the non-linear relation between length and reward. Finally, we incorporate this learned relation into the reward model to debias. Experimental results demonstrate that FiMi-RM achieves a more balanced length-reward distribution. Furthermore, when applied to alignment algorithms, our debiased reward model improves length-controlled win rate and reduces verbosity without compromising its performance.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12843v1
Feature Hedging: Correlated Features Break Narrow Sparse Autoencoders,"It is assumed that sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose polysemantic activations into interpretable linear directions, as long as the activations are composed of sparse linear combinations of underlying features. However, we find that if an SAE is more narrow than the number of underlying ""true features"" on which it is trained, and there is correlation between features, the SAE will merge components of correlated features together, thus destroying monosemanticity. In LLM SAEs, these two conditions are almost certainly true. This phenomenon, which we call feature hedging, is caused by SAE reconstruction loss, and is more severe the narrower the SAE. In this work, we introduce the problem of feature hedging and study it both theoretically in toy models and empirically in SAEs trained on LLMs. We suspect that feature hedging may be one of the core reasons that SAEs consistently underperform supervised baselines. Finally, we use our understanding of feature hedging to propose an improved variant of matryoshka SAEs. Our work shows there remain fundamental issues with SAEs, but we are hopeful that that highlighting feature hedging will catalyze future advances that allow SAEs to achieve their full potential of interpreting LLMs at scale.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11756v1
Robust Planning for Autonomous Driving via Mixed Adversarial Diffusion   Predictions,"We describe a robust planning method for autonomous driving that mixes normal and adversarial agent predictions output by a diffusion model trained for motion prediction. We first train a diffusion model to learn an unbiased distribution of normal agent behaviors. We then generate a distribution of adversarial predictions by biasing the diffusion model at test time to generate predictions that are likely to collide with a candidate plan. We score plans using expected cost with respect to a mixture distribution of normal and adversarial predictions, leading to a planner that is robust against adversarial behaviors but not overly conservative when agents behave normally. Unlike current approaches, we do not use risk measures that over-weight adversarial behaviors while placing little to no weight on low-cost normal behaviors or use hard safety constraints that may not be appropriate for all driving scenarios. We show the effectiveness of our method on single-agent and multi-agent jaywalking scenarios as well as a red light violation scenario.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12327v1
ToLeaP: Rethinking Development of Tool Learning with Large Language   Models,"Tool learning, which enables large language models (LLMs) to utilize external tools effectively, has garnered increasing attention for its potential to revolutionize productivity across industries. Despite rapid development in tool learning, key challenges and opportunities remain understudied, limiting deeper insights and future advancements. In this paper, we investigate the tool learning ability of 41 prevalent LLMs by reproducing 33 benchmarks and enabling one-click evaluation for seven of them, forming a Tool Learning Platform named ToLeaP. We also collect 21 out of 33 potential training datasets to facilitate future exploration. After analyzing over 3,000 bad cases of 41 LLMs based on ToLeaP, we identify four main critical challenges: (1) benchmark limitations induce both the neglect and lack of (2) autonomous learning, (3) generalization, and (4) long-horizon task-solving capabilities of LLMs. To aid future advancements, we take a step further toward exploring potential directions, namely (1) real-world benchmark construction, (2) compatibility-aware autonomous learning, (3) rationale learning by thinking, and (4) identifying and recalling key clues. The preliminary experiments demonstrate their effectiveness, highlighting the need for further research and exploration.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11833v1
SynDec: A Synthesize-then-Decode Approach for Arbitrary Textual Style   Transfer via Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as dominant forces for textual style transfer. However, for arbitrary style transfer, LLMs face two key challenges: (1) considerable reliance on manually-constructed prompts and (2) rigid stylistic biases inherent in LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel Synthesize-then-Decode (SynDec) approach, which automatically synthesizes high-quality prompts and amplifies their roles during decoding process. Specifically, our approach synthesizes prompts by selecting representative few-shot samples, conducting a four-dimensional style analysis, and reranking the candidates. At LLM decoding stage, the TST effect is amplified by maximizing the contrast in output probabilities between scenarios with and without the synthesized prompt, as well as between prompts and negative samples. We conduct extensive experiments and the results show that SynDec outperforms existing state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on five out of six benchmarks (e.g., achieving up to a 9\% increase in accuracy for modern-to-Elizabethan English transfer). Detailed ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of SynDec.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12821v1
A Physics-Inspired Optimizer: Velocity Regularized Adam,"We introduce Velocity-Regularized Adam (VRAdam), a physics-inspired optimizer for training deep neural networks that draws on ideas from quartic terms for kinetic energy with its stabilizing effects on various system dynamics. Previous algorithms, including the ubiquitous Adam, operate at the so called adaptive edge of stability regime during training leading to rapid oscillations and slowed convergence of loss. However, VRAdam adds a higher order penalty on the learning rate based on the velocity such that the algorithm automatically slows down whenever weight updates become large. In practice, we observe that the effective dynamic learning rate shrinks in high-velocity regimes, damping oscillations and allowing for a more aggressive base step size when necessary without divergence. By combining this velocity-based regularizer for global damping with per-parameter scaling of Adam to create a hybrid optimizer, we demonstrate that VRAdam consistently exceeds the performance against standard optimizers including AdamW. We benchmark various tasks such as image classification, language modeling, image generation and generative modeling using diverse architectures and training methodologies including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and GFlowNets.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13196v1
Attention-Enhanced U-Net for Accurate Segmentation of COVID-19 Infected   Lung Regions in CT Scans,"In this study, we propose a robust methodology for automatic segmentation of infected lung regions in COVID-19 CT scans using convolutional neural networks. The approach is based on a modified U-Net architecture enhanced with attention mechanisms, data augmentation, and postprocessing techniques. It achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.8658 and mean IoU of 0.8316, outperforming other methods. The dataset was sourced from public repositories and augmented for diversity. Results demonstrate superior segmentation performance. Future work includes expanding the dataset, exploring 3D segmentation, and preparing the model for clinical deployment.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12298v1
Towards Budget-Friendly Model-Agnostic Explanation Generation for Large   Language Models,"With Large language models (LLMs) becoming increasingly prevalent in various applications, the need for interpreting their predictions has become a critical challenge. As LLMs vary in architecture and some are closed-sourced, model-agnostic techniques show great promise without requiring access to the model's internal parameters. However, existing model-agnostic techniques need to invoke LLMs many times to gain sufficient samples for generating faithful explanations, which leads to high economic costs. In this paper, we show that it is practical to generate faithful explanations for large-scale LLMs by sampling from some budget-friendly models through a series of empirical studies. Moreover, we show that such proxy explanations also perform well on downstream tasks. Our analysis provides a new paradigm of model-agnostic explanation methods for LLMs, by including information from budget-friendly models.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12509v1
Measuring Information Distortion in Hierarchical Ultra long Novel   Generation:The Optimal Expansion Ratio,"Writing novels with Large Language Models (LLMs) raises a critical question: how much human-authored outline is necessary to generate high-quality million-word novels? While frameworks such as DOME, Plan&Write, and Long Writer have improved stylistic coherence and logical consistency, they primarily target shorter novels (10k--100k words), leaving ultra-long generation largely unexplored. Drawing on insights from recent text compression methods like LLMZip and LLM2Vec, we conduct an information-theoretic analysis that quantifies distortion occurring when LLMs compress and reconstruct ultra-long novels under varying compression-expansion ratios. We introduce a hierarchical two-stage generation pipeline (outline -> detailed outline -> manuscript) and find an optimal outline length that balances information preservation with human effort. Through extensive experimentation with Chinese novels, we establish that a two-stage hierarchical outline approach significantly reduces semantic distortion compared to single-stage methods. Our findings provide empirically-grounded guidance for authors and researchers collaborating with LLMs to create million-word novels.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12572v1
Retrospex: Language Agent Meets Offline Reinforcement Learning Critic,"Large Language Models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and commonsense reasoning capabilities, making them valuable for creating powerful agents. However, existing LLM agent frameworks have not fully utilized past experiences for improvement. This work introduces a new LLM-based agent framework called Retrospex, which addresses this challenge by analyzing past experiences in depth. Unlike previous approaches, Retrospex does not directly integrate experiences into the LLM's context. Instead, it combines the LLM's action likelihood with action values estimated by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) Critic, which is trained on past experiences through an offline ''retrospection'' process. Additionally, Retrospex employs a dynamic action rescoring mechanism that increases the importance of experience-based values for tasks that require more interaction with the environment. We evaluate Retrospex in ScienceWorld, ALFWorld and Webshop environments, demonstrating its advantages over strong, contemporary baselines.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11807v1
CrafText Benchmark: Advancing Instruction Following in Complex   Multimodal Open-Ended World,"Following instructions in real-world conditions requires the ability to adapt to the world's volatility and entanglement: the environment is dynamic and unpredictable, instructions can be linguistically complex with diverse vocabulary, and the number of possible goals an agent may encounter is vast. Despite extensive research in this area, most studies are conducted in static environments with simple instructions and a limited vocabulary, making it difficult to assess agent performance in more diverse and challenging settings. To address this gap, we introduce CrafText, a benchmark for evaluating instruction following in a multimodal environment with diverse instructions and dynamic interactions. CrafText includes 3,924 instructions with 3,423 unique words, covering Localization, Conditional, Building, and Achievement tasks. Additionally, we propose an evaluation protocol that measures an agent's ability to generalize to novel instruction formulations and dynamically evolving task configurations, providing a rigorous test of both linguistic understanding and adaptive decision-making.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11962v1
Learning Robust Spectral Dynamics for Temporal Domain Generalization,"Modern machine learning models struggle to maintain performance in dynamic environments where temporal distribution shifts, \emph{i.e., concept drift}, are prevalent. Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) seeks to enable model generalization across evolving domains, yet existing approaches typically assume smooth incremental changes, struggling with complex real-world drifts involving long-term structure (incremental evolution/periodicity) and local uncertainties. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FreKoo, which tackles these challenges via a novel frequency-domain analysis of parameter trajectories. It leverages the Fourier transform to disentangle parameter evolution into distinct spectral bands. Specifically, low-frequency component with dominant dynamics are learned and extrapolated using the Koopman operator, robustly capturing diverse drift patterns including both incremental and periodicity. Simultaneously, potentially disruptive high-frequency variations are smoothed via targeted temporal regularization, preventing overfitting to transient noise and domain uncertainties. In addition, this dual spectral strategy is rigorously grounded through theoretical analysis, providing stability guarantees for the Koopman prediction, a principled Bayesian justification for the high-frequency regularization, and culminating in a multiscale generalization bound connecting spectral dynamics to improved generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate FreKoo's significant superiority over SOTA TDG approaches, particularly excelling in real-world streaming scenarios with complex drifts and uncertainties.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12585v1
Contextual Paralinguistic Data Creation for Multi-Modal Speech-LLM: Data   Condensation and Spoken QA Generation,"Current speech-LLMs exhibit limited capability in contextual reasoning alongside paralinguistic understanding, primarily due to the lack of Question-Answer (QA) datasets that cover both aspects. We propose a novel framework for dataset generation from in-the-wild speech data, that integrates contextual reasoning with paralinguistic information. It consists of a pseudo paralinguistic label-based data condensation of in-the-wild speech and LLM-based Contextual Paralinguistic QA (CPQA) generation. The effectiveness is validated by a strong correlation in evaluations of the Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct model on a dataset created by our framework and human-generated CPQA dataset. The results also reveal the speech-LLM's limitations in handling empathetic reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for such datasets and more robust models. The proposed framework is first of its kind and has potential in training more robust speech-LLMs with paralinguistic reasoning capabilities.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13338v1
MAGI-1: Autoregressive Video Generation at Scale,"We present MAGI-1, a world model that generates videos by autoregressively predicting a sequence of video chunks, defined as fixed-length segments of consecutive frames. Trained to denoise per-chunk noise that increases monotonically over time, MAGI-1 enables causal temporal modeling and naturally supports streaming generation. It achieves strong performance on image-to-video (I2V) tasks conditioned on text instructions, providing high temporal consistency and scalability, which are made possible by several algorithmic innovations and a dedicated infrastructure stack. MAGI-1 facilitates controllable generation via chunk-wise prompting and supports real-time, memory-efficient deployment by maintaining constant peak inference cost, regardless of video length. The largest variant of MAGI-1 comprises 24 billion parameters and supports context lengths of up to 4 million tokens, demonstrating the scalability and robustness of our approach. The code and models are available at https://github.com/SandAI-org/MAGI-1 and https://github.com/SandAI-org/MagiAttention. The product can be accessed at https://sand.ai.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13211v1
Not All Documents Are What You Need for Extracting Instruction Tuning   Data,"Instruction tuning improves the performance of large language models (LLMs), but it heavily relies on high-quality training data. Recently, LLMs have been used to synthesize instruction data using seed question-answer (QA) pairs. However, these synthesized instructions often lack diversity and tend to be similar to the input seeds, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose extracting instruction tuning data from web corpora that contain rich and diverse knowledge. A naive solution is to retrieve domain-specific documents and extract all QA pairs from them, but this faces two key challenges: (1) extracting all QA pairs using LLMs is prohibitively expensive, and (2) many extracted QA pairs may be irrelevant to the downstream tasks, potentially degrading model performance. To tackle these issues, we introduce EQUAL, an effective and scalable data extraction framework that iteratively alternates between document selection and high-quality QA pair extraction to enhance instruction tuning. EQUAL first clusters the document corpus based on embeddings derived from contrastive learning, then uses a multi-armed bandit strategy to efficiently identify clusters that are likely to contain valuable QA pairs. This iterative approach significantly reduces computational cost while boosting model performance. Experiments on AutoMathText and StackOverflow across four downstream tasks show that EQUAL reduces computational costs by 5-10x and improves accuracy by 2.5 percent on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12250v1
Evaluating the Logical Reasoning Abilities of Large Reasoning Models,"Large reasoning models, often post-trained on long chain-of-thought (long CoT) data with reinforcement learning, achieve state-of-the-art performance on mathematical, coding, and domain-specific reasoning benchmarks. However, their logical reasoning capabilities - fundamental to human cognition and independent of domain knowledge - remain understudied. To address this gap, we introduce LogiEval, a holistic benchmark for evaluating logical reasoning in large reasoning models. LogiEval spans diverse reasoning types (deductive, inductive, analogical, and abductive) and task formats (e.g., logical sequence, argument analysis), sourced from high-quality human examinations (e.g., LSAT, GMAT). Our experiments demonstrate that modern reasoning models excel at 4-choice argument analysis problems and analogical reasoning, surpassing human performance, yet exhibit uneven capabilities across reasoning types and formats, highlighting limitations in their generalization. Our analysis reveals that human performance does not mirror model failure distributions. To foster further research, we curate LogiEval-Hard, a challenging subset identified through a novel screening paradigm where small-model failures (Qwen3-30B-A3B) reliably predict difficulties for larger models. Modern models show striking, consistent failures on LogiEval-Hard. This demonstrates that fundamental reasoning bottlenecks persist across model scales, and establishes LogiEval-Hard as both a diagnostic tool and a rigorous testbed for advancing logical reasoning in LLMs.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11854v1
TimeSeriesGym: A Scalable Benchmark for (Time Series) Machine Learning   Engineering Agents,"We introduce TimeSeriesGym, a scalable benchmarking framework for evaluating Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents on time series machine learning engineering challenges. Existing benchmarks lack scalability, focus narrowly on model building in well-defined settings, and evaluate only a limited set of research artifacts (e.g., CSV submission files). To make AI agent benchmarking more relevant to the practice of machine learning engineering, our framework scales along two critical dimensions. First, recognizing that effective ML engineering requires a range of diverse skills, TimeSeriesGym incorporates challenges from diverse sources spanning multiple domains and tasks. We design challenges to evaluate both isolated capabilities (including data handling, understanding research repositories, and code translation) and their combinations, and rather than addressing each challenge independently, we develop tools that support designing multiple challenges at scale. Second, we implement evaluation mechanisms for multiple research artifacts, including submission files, code, and models, using both precise numeric measures and more flexible LLM-based evaluation approaches. This dual strategy balances objective assessment with contextual judgment. Although our initial focus is on time series applications, our framework can be readily extended to other data modalities, broadly enhancing the comprehensiveness and practical utility of agentic AI evaluation. We open-source our benchmarking framework to facilitate future research on the ML engineering capabilities of AI agents.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13291v1
"When majority rules, minority loses: bias amplification of gradient   descent","Despite growing empirical evidence of bias amplification in machine learning, its theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. We develop a formal framework for majority-minority learning tasks, showing how standard training can favor majority groups and produce stereotypical predictors that neglect minority-specific features. Assuming population and variance imbalance, our analysis reveals three key findings: (i) the close proximity between ``full-data'' and stereotypical predictors, (ii) the dominance of a region where training the entire model tends to merely learn the majority traits, and (iii) a lower bound on the additional training required. Our results are illustrated through experiments in deep learning for tabular and image classification tasks.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13122v1
Towards Effective Federated Graph Foundation Model via Mitigating   Knowledge Entanglement,"Recent advances in graph machine learning have shifted to data-centric paradigms, driven by two emerging fields: (1) Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multi-client collaboration but faces challenges from data and task heterogeneity, limiting its practicality; (2) Graph foundation models (GFM) offer strong domain generalization but are usually trained on single machines, missing out on cross-silo data and resources.   These paradigms are complementary, and their integration brings notable benefits. Motivated by this, we propose FedGFM, a novel decentralized GFM training paradigm. However, a key challenge is knowledge entanglement, where multi-domain knowledge merges into indistinguishable representations, hindering downstream adaptation.   To address this, we present FedGFM+, an enhanced framework with two core modules to reduce knowledge entanglement: (1) AncDAI: A global anchor-based domain-aware initialization strategy. Before pre-training, each client encodes its local graph into domain-specific prototypes that serve as semantic anchors. Synthetic embeddings around these anchors initialize the global model. We theoretically prove these prototypes are distinguishable across domains, providing a strong inductive bias to disentangle domain-specific knowledge. (2) AdaDPP: A local adaptive domain-sensitive prompt pool. Each client learns a lightweight graph prompt capturing domain semantics during pre-training. During fine-tuning, prompts from all clients form a pool from which the GFM selects relevant prompts to augment target graph attributes, improving downstream adaptation.   FedGFM+ is evaluated on 8 diverse benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks, outperforming 20 baselines from supervised learning, FGL, and federated GFM variants.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12684v1
Efficient Generation of Parameterised Quantum Circuits from Large Texts,"Quantum approaches to natural language processing (NLP) are redefining how linguistic information is represented and processed. While traditional hybrid quantum-classical models rely heavily on classical neural networks, recent advancements propose a novel framework, DisCoCirc, capable of directly encoding entire documents as parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs), besides enjoying some additional interpretability and compositionality benefits. Following these ideas, this paper introduces an efficient methodology for converting large-scale texts into quantum circuits using tree-like representations of pregroup diagrams. Exploiting the compositional parallels between language and quantum mechanics, grounded in symmetric monoidal categories, our approach enables faithful and efficient encoding of syntactic and discourse relationships in long and complex texts (up to 6410 words in our experiments) to quantum circuits. The developed system is provided to the community as part of the augmented open-source quantum NLP package lambeq Gen II.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13208v1
An Explanation of Intrinsic Self-Correction via Linear Representations   and Latent Concepts,"We provide an explanation for the performance gains of intrinsic self-correction, a process where a language model iteratively refines its outputs without external feedback. More precisely, we investigate how prompting induces interpretable changes in hidden states and thus affects the output distributions. We hypothesize that each prompt-induced shift lies in a linear span of some linear representation vectors, naturally separating tokens based on individual concept alignment. Building around this idea, we give a mathematical formulation of self-correction and derive a concentration result for output tokens based on alignment magnitudes. Our experiments on text detoxification with zephyr-7b-sft reveal a substantial gap in the inner products of the prompt-induced shifts and the unembeddings of the top-100 most toxic tokens vs. those of the unembeddings of the bottom-100 least toxic tokens, under toxic instructions. This suggests that self-correction prompts enhance a language model's capability of latent concept recognition. Our analysis offers insights into the underlying mechanism of self-correction by characterizing how prompting works explainably. For reproducibility, our code is available.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11924v1
RoPECraft: Training-Free Motion Transfer with Trajectory-Guided RoPE   Optimization on Diffusion Transformers,"We propose RoPECraft, a training-free video motion transfer method for diffusion transformers that operates solely by modifying their rotary positional embeddings (RoPE). We first extract dense optical flow from a reference video, and utilize the resulting motion offsets to warp the complex-exponential tensors of RoPE, effectively encoding motion into the generation process. These embeddings are then further optimized during denoising time steps via trajectory alignment between the predicted and target velocities using a flow-matching objective. To keep the output faithful to the text prompt and prevent duplicate generations, we incorporate a regularization term based on the phase components of the reference video's Fourier transform, projecting the phase angles onto a smooth manifold to suppress high-frequency artifacts. Experiments on benchmarks reveal that RoPECraft outperforms all recently published methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13344v1
RLAP: A Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Adaptive Planning Framework for   Multi-step NLP Task Solving,"Multi-step planning has been widely employed to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks, which decomposes the original task into multiple subtasks and guide LLMs to solve them sequentially without additional training. When addressing task instances, existing methods either preset the order of steps or attempt multiple paths at each step. However, these methods overlook instances' linguistic features and rely on the intrinsic planning capabilities of LLMs to evaluate intermediate feedback and then select subtasks, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. To better solve multi-step NLP tasks with LLMs, in this paper we propose a Reinforcement Learning enhanced Adaptive Planning framework (RLAP). In our framework, we model an NLP task as a Markov decision process (MDP) and employ an LLM directly into the environment. In particular, a lightweight Actor model is trained to estimate Q-values for natural language sequences consisting of states and actions through reinforcement learning. Therefore, during sequential planning, the linguistic features of each sequence in the MDP can be taken into account, and the Actor model interacts with the LLM to determine the optimal order of subtasks for each task instance. We apply RLAP on three different types of NLP tasks and conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets to verify RLAP's effectiveness and robustness.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11893v1
Solver-Informed RL: Grounding Large Language Models for Authentic   Optimization Modeling,"Optimization modeling is fundamental to decision-making across diverse domains.Despite progress in automating optimization formulation from natural language descriptions, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to generate formally correct and usable models due to hallucinations, posing a challenge for reliable automation. Inspired by the success of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in enhancing Large Reasoning Models, we present Solver-Informed Reinforcement Learning (SIRL).This novel framework leverages external optimization solvers as verifiable reward mechanisms to significantly improve the authenticity of LLMs for optimization modeling.Acting as precise verifiers, these solvers automatically assess the executable code and the instance-level mathematical model represented by the associated LP file, yielding precise and comprehensive feedback signals -- including syntax, feasibility, and solution quality that directly inform the RL process. This automated verification process, powered by classic optimization solvers, also underpins our instance-enhanced self-consistency method to synthesize high-quality training data. Extensive experiments on diverse public benchmarks demonstrate that SIRL achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing methods in generating accurate and executable optimization models.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11792v1
Zero-Shot Visual Generalization in Robot Manipulation,"Training vision-based manipulation policies that are robust across diverse visual environments remains an important and unresolved challenge in robot learning. Current approaches often sidestep the problem by relying on invariant representations such as point clouds and depth, or by brute-forcing generalization through visual domain randomization and/or large, visually diverse datasets. Disentangled representation learning - especially when combined with principles of associative memory - has recently shown promise in enabling vision-based reinforcement learning policies to be robust to visual distribution shifts. However, these techniques have largely been constrained to simpler benchmarks and toy environments. In this work, we scale disentangled representation learning and associative memory to more visually and dynamically complex manipulation tasks and demonstrate zero-shot adaptability to visual perturbations in both simulation and on real hardware. We further extend this approach to imitation learning, specifically Diffusion Policy, and empirically show significant gains in visual generalization compared to state-of-the-art imitation learning methods. Finally, we introduce a novel technique adapted from the model equivariance literature that transforms any trained neural network policy into one invariant to 2D planar rotations, making our policy not only visually robust but also resilient to certain camera perturbations. We believe that this work marks a significant step towards manipulation policies that are not only adaptable out of the box, but also robust to the complexities and dynamical nature of real-world deployment.

Robin: A multi-agent system for automating scientific discovery,"Scientific discovery is driven by the iterative process of background research, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and data analysis. Despite recent advancements in applying artificial intelligence to scientific discovery, no system has yet automated all of these stages in a single workflow. Here, we introduce Robin, the first multi-agent system capable of fully automating the key intellectual steps of the scientific process. By integrating literature search agents with data analysis agents, Robin can generate hypotheses, propose experiments, interpret experimental results, and generate updated hypotheses, achieving a semi-autonomous approach to scientific discovery. By applying this system, we were able to identify a novel treatment for dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD), the major cause of blindness in the developed world. Robin proposed enhancing retinal pigment epithelium phagocytosis as a therapeutic strategy, and identified and validated a promising therapeutic candidate, ripasudil. Ripasudil is a clinically-used rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor that has never previously been proposed for treating dAMD. To elucidate the mechanism of ripasudil-induced upregulation of phagocytosis, Robin then proposed and analyzed a follow-up RNA-seq experiment, which revealed upregulation of ABCA1, a critical lipid efflux pump and possible novel target. All hypotheses, experimental plans, data analyses, and data figures in the main text of this report were produced by Robin. As the first AI system to autonomously discover and validate a novel therapeutic candidate within an iterative lab-in-the-loop framework, Robin establishes a new paradigm for AI-driven scientific discovery.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13400v1
Not All Thoughts are Generated Equal: Efficient LLM Reasoning via   Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning,"Compressing long chain-of-thought (CoT) from large language models (LLMs) is an emerging strategy to improve the reasoning efficiency of LLMs. Despite its promising benefits, existing studies equally compress all thoughts within a long CoT, hindering more concise and effective reasoning. To this end, we first investigate the importance of different thoughts by examining their effectiveness and efficiency in contributing to reasoning through automatic long CoT chunking and Monte Carlo rollouts. Building upon the insights, we propose a theoretically bounded metric to jointly measure the effectiveness and efficiency of different thoughts. We then propose Long$\otimes$Short, an efficient reasoning framework that enables two LLMs to collaboratively solve the problem: a long-thought LLM for more effectively generating important thoughts, while a short-thought LLM for efficiently generating remaining thoughts. Specifically, we begin by synthesizing a small amount of cold-start data to fine-tune LLMs for long-thought and short-thought reasoning styles, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a synergizing-oriented multi-turn reinforcement learning, focusing on the model self-evolution and collaboration between long-thought and short-thought LLMs. Experimental results show that our method enables Qwen2.5-7B and Llama3.1-8B to achieve comparable performance compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, while reducing token length by over 80% across the MATH500, AIME24/25, AMC23, and GPQA Diamond benchmarks.

Attribution Projection Calculus: A Novel Framework for Causal Inference   in Bayesian Networks,"This paper introduces Attribution Projection Calculus (AP-Calculus), a novel mathematical framework for determining causal relationships in structured Bayesian networks. We investigate a specific network architecture with source nodes connected to destination nodes through intermediate nodes, where each input maps to a single label with maximum marginal probability. We prove that for each label, exactly one intermediate node acts as a deconfounder while others serve as confounders, enabling optimal attribution of features to their corresponding labels. The framework formalizes the dual nature of intermediate nodes as both confounders and deconfounders depending on the context, and establishes separation functions that maximize distinctions between intermediate representations. We demonstrate that the proposed network architecture is optimal for causal inference compared to alternative structures, including those based on Pearl's causal framework. AP-Calculus provides a comprehensive mathematical foundation for analyzing feature-label attributions, managing spurious correlations, quantifying information gain, ensuring fairness, and evaluating uncertainty in prediction models, including large language models. Theoretical verification shows that AP-Calculus not only extends but can also subsume traditional do-calculus for many practical applications, offering a more direct approach to causal inference in supervised learning contexts.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12094v1
mCLM: A Function-Infused and Synthesis-Friendly Modular Chemical   Language Model,"Despite their ability to understand chemical knowledge and accurately generate sequential representations, large language models (LLMs) remain limited in their capacity to propose novel molecules with drug-like properties. In addition, the molecules that LLMs propose can often be challenging to make in the lab. To more effectively enable the discovery of functional small molecules, LLMs need to learn a molecular language. However, LLMs are currently limited by encoding molecules from atoms. In this paper, we argue that just like tokenizing texts into (sub-)word tokens instead of characters, molecules should be decomposed and reassembled at the level of functional building blocks, i.e., parts of molecules that bring unique functions and serve as effective building blocks for real-world automated laboratory synthesis. This motivates us to propose mCLM, a modular Chemical-Language Model tokenizing molecules into building blocks and learning a bilingual language model of both natural language descriptions of functions and molecule building blocks. By reasoning on such functional building blocks, mCLM guarantees to generate efficiently synthesizable molecules thanks to recent progress in block-based chemistry, while also improving the functions of molecules in a principled manner. In experiments on 430 FDA-approved drugs, we find mCLM capable of significantly improving 5 out of 6 chemical functions critical to determining drug potentials. More importantly, mCLM can reason on multiple functions and improve the FDA-rejected drugs (``fallen angels'') over multiple iterations to greatly improve their shortcomings.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12565v1
Internal Causal Mechanisms Robustly Predict Language Model   Out-of-Distribution Behaviors,"Interpretability research now offers a variety of techniques for identifying abstract internal mechanisms in neural networks. Can such techniques be used to predict how models will behave on out-of-distribution examples? In this work, we provide a positive answer to this question. Through a diverse set of language modeling tasks--including symbol manipulation, knowledge retrieval, and instruction following--we show that the most robust features for correctness prediction are those that play a distinctive causal role in the model's behavior. Specifically, we propose two methods that leverage causal mechanisms to predict the correctness of model outputs: counterfactual simulation (checking whether key causal variables are realized) and value probing (using the values of those variables to make predictions). Both achieve high AUC-ROC in distribution and outperform methods that rely on causal-agnostic features in out-of-distribution settings, where predicting model behaviors is more crucial. Our work thus highlights a novel and significant application for internal causal analysis of language models.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11770v1
Curriculum Abductive Learning,"Abductive Learning (ABL) integrates machine learning with logical reasoning in a loop: a learning model predicts symbolic concept labels from raw inputs, which are revised through abduction using domain knowledge and then fed back for retraining. However, due to the nondeterminism of abduction, the training process often suffers from instability, especially when the knowledge base is large and complex, resulting in a prohibitively large abduction space. While prior works focus on improving candidate selection within this space, they typically treat the knowledge base as a static black box. In this work, we propose Curriculum Abductive Learning (C-ABL), a method that explicitly leverages the internal structure of the knowledge base to address the ABL training challenges. C-ABL partitions the knowledge base into a sequence of sub-bases, progressively introduced during training. This reduces the abduction space throughout training and enables the model to incorporate logic in a stepwise, smooth way. Experiments across multiple tasks show that C-ABL outperforms previous ABL implementations, significantly improves training stability, convergence speed, and final accuracy, especially under complex knowledge setting.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12275v1
Conditional Deep Generative Models for Belief State Planning,"Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are used to model a wide range of applications, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, and subsurface problems. However, accurately representing the belief is difficult for POMDPs with high-dimensional states. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses conditional deep generative models (cDGMs) to represent the belief. Unlike traditional belief representations, cDGMs are well-suited for high-dimensional states and large numbers of observations, and they can generate an arbitrary number of samples from the posterior belief. We train the cDGMs on data produced by random rollout trajectories and show their effectiveness in solving a mineral exploration POMDP with a large and continuous state space. The cDGMs outperform particle filter baselines in both task-agnostic measures of belief accuracy as well as in planning performance.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11698v1
Scalable Video-to-Dataset Generation for Cross-Platform Mobile Agents,"Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have sparked significant interest in developing GUI visual agents. We introduce MONDAY (Mobile OS Navigation Task Dataset for Agents from YouTube), a large-scale dataset of 313K annotated frames from 20K instructional videos capturing diverse real-world mobile OS navigation across multiple platforms. Models that include MONDAY in their pre-training phases demonstrate robust cross-platform generalization capabilities, consistently outperforming models trained on existing single OS datasets while achieving an average performance gain of 18.11%p on an unseen mobile OS platform. To enable continuous dataset expansion as mobile platforms evolve, we present an automated framework that leverages publicly available video content to create comprehensive task datasets without manual annotation. Our framework comprises robust OCR-based scene detection (95.04% F1score), near-perfect UI element detection (99.87% hit ratio), and novel multi-step action identification to extract reliable action sequences across diverse interface configurations. We contribute both the MONDAY dataset and our automated collection framework to facilitate future research in mobile OS navigation.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12632v1
WikiPersonas: What Can We Learn From Personalized Alignment to Famous   People?,"Preference alignment has become a standard pipeline in finetuning models to follow \emph{generic} human preferences. Majority of work seeks to optimize model to produce responses that would be preferable \emph{on average}, simplifying the diverse and often \emph{contradicting} space of human preferences. While research has increasingly focused on personalized alignment: adapting models to individual user preferences, there is a lack of personalized preference dataset which focus on nuanced individual-level preferences. To address this, we introduce WikiPersona: the first fine-grained personalization using well-documented, famous individuals. Our dataset challenges models to align with these personas through an interpretable process: generating verifiable textual descriptions of a persona's background and preferences in addition to alignment. We systematically evaluate different personalization approaches and find that as few-shot prompting with preferences and fine-tuning fail to simultaneously ensure effectiveness and efficiency, using \textit{inferred personal preferences} as prefixes enables effective personalization, especially in topics where preferences clash while leading to more equitable generalization across unseen personas.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13257v1
Recommender Systems for Democracy: Toward Adversarial Robustness in   Voting Advice Applications,"Voting advice applications (VAAs) help millions of voters understand which political parties or candidates best align with their views. This paper explores the potential risks these applications pose to the democratic process when targeted by adversarial entities. In particular, we expose 11 manipulation strategies and measure their impact using data from Switzerland's primary VAA, Smartvote, collected during the last two national elections. We find that altering application parameters, such as the matching method, can shift a party's recommendation frequency by up to 105%. Cherry-picking questionnaire items can increase party recommendation frequency by over 261%, while subtle changes to parties' or candidates' responses can lead to a 248% increase. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose adversarial robustness properties VAAs should satisfy, introduce empirical metrics for assessing the resilience of various matching methods, and suggest possible avenues for research toward mitigating the effect of manipulation. Our framework is key to ensuring secure and reliable AI-based VAAs poised to emerge in the near future.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13329v1
Fractured Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,"Inference-time scaling techniques have significantly bolstered the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by harnessing additional computational effort at inference without retraining. Similarly, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and its extension, Long CoT, improve accuracy by generating rich intermediate reasoning trajectories, but these approaches incur substantial token costs that impede their deployment in latency-sensitive settings. In this work, we first show that truncated CoT, which stops reasoning before completion and directly generates the final answer, often matches full CoT sampling while using dramatically fewer tokens. Building on this insight, we introduce Fractured Sampling, a unified inference-time strategy that interpolates between full CoT and solution-only sampling along three orthogonal axes: (1) the number of reasoning trajectories, (2) the number of final solutions per trajectory, and (3) the depth at which reasoning traces are truncated. Through extensive experiments on five diverse reasoning benchmarks and several model scales, we demonstrate that Fractured Sampling consistently achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs, yielding steep log-linear scaling gains in Pass@k versus token budget. Our analysis reveals how to allocate computation across these dimensions to maximize performance, paving the way for more efficient and scalable LLM reasoning.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12992v1
Improving Medium Range Severe Weather Prediction through Transformer   Post-processing of AI Weather Forecasts,"Improving the skill of medium-range (1-8 day) severe weather prediction is crucial for mitigating societal impacts. This study introduces a novel approach leveraging decoder-only transformer networks to post-process AI-based weather forecasts, specifically from the Pangu-Weather model, for improved severe weather guidance. Unlike traditional post-processing methods that use a dense neural network to predict the probability of severe weather using discrete forecast samples, our method treats forecast lead times as sequential ``tokens'', enabling the transformer to learn complex temporal relationships within the evolving atmospheric state. We compare this approach against post-processing of the Global Forecast System (GFS) using both a traditional dense neural network and our transformer, as well as configurations that exclude convective parameters to fairly evaluate the impact of using the Pangu-Weather AI model. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based post-processing significantly enhances forecast skill compared to dense neural networks. Furthermore, AI-driven forecasts, particularly Pangu-Weather initialized from high resolution analysis, exhibit superior performance to GFS in the medium-range, even without explicit convective parameters. Our approach offers improved accuracy, and reliability, which also provides interpretability through feature attribution analysis, advancing medium-range severe weather prediction capabilities.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11750v1
"FRAbench and GenEval: Scaling Fine-Grained Aspect Evaluation across   Tasks, Modalities","Evaluating the open-ended outputs of large language models (LLMs) has become a bottleneck as model capabilities, task diversity, and modality coverage rapidly expand. Existing ""LLM-as-a-Judge"" evaluators are typically narrow in a few tasks, aspects, or modalities, and easily suffer from low consistency. In this paper, we argue that explicit, fine-grained aspect specification is the key to both generalizability and objectivity in automated evaluation. To do so, we introduce a hierarchical aspect taxonomy spanning 112 aspects that unifies evaluation across four representative settings - Natural Language Generation, Image Understanding, Image Generation, and Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation. Building on this taxonomy, we create FRAbench, a benchmark comprising 60.4k pairwise samples with 325k aspect-level labels obtained from a combination of human and LLM annotations. FRAbench provides the first large-scale, multi-modal resource for training and meta-evaluating fine-grained LMM judges. Leveraging FRAbench, we develop GenEval, a fine-grained evaluator generalizable across tasks and modalities. Experiments show that GenEval (i) attains high agreement with GPT-4o and expert annotators, (ii) transfers robustly to unseen tasks and modalities, and (iii) reveals systematic weaknesses of current LMMs on evaluation.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12795v1
The Hidden Dangers of Browsing AI Agents,"Autonomous browsing agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate web-based tasks. However, their reliance on dynamic content, tool execution, and user-provided data exposes them to a broad attack surface. This paper presents a comprehensive security evaluation of such agents, focusing on systemic vulnerabilities across multiple architectural layers. Our work outlines the first end-to-end threat model for browsing agents and provides actionable guidance for securing their deployment in real-world environments. To address discovered threats, we propose a defense in depth strategy incorporating input sanitization, planner executor isolation, formal analyzers, and session safeguards. These measures protect against both initial access and post exploitation attack vectors. Through a white box analysis of a popular open source project, Browser Use, we demonstrate how untrusted web content can hijack agent behavior and lead to critical security breaches.

DreamGen: Unlocking Generalization in Robot Learning through Neural   Trajectories,"We introduce DreamGen, a simple yet highly effective 4-stage pipeline for training robot policies that generalize across behaviors and environments through neural trajectories - synthetic robot data generated from video world models. DreamGen leverages state-of-the-art image-to-video generative models, adapting them to the target robot embodiment to produce photorealistic synthetic videos of familiar or novel tasks in diverse environments. Since these models generate only videos, we recover pseudo-action sequences using either a latent action model or an inverse-dynamics model (IDM). Despite its simplicity, DreamGen unlocks strong behavior and environment generalization: a humanoid robot can perform 22 new behaviors in both seen and unseen environments, while requiring teleoperation data from only a single pick-and-place task in one environment. To evaluate the pipeline systematically, we introduce DreamGen Bench, a video generation benchmark that shows a strong correlation between benchmark performance and downstream policy success. Our work establishes a promising new axis for scaling robot learning well beyond manual data collection.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12705v1
ABoN: Adaptive Best-of-N Alignment,"Recent advances in test-time alignment methods, such as Best-of-N sampling, offer a simple and effective way to steer language models (LMs) toward preferred behaviors using reward models (RM). However, these approaches can be computationally expensive, especially when applied uniformly across prompts without accounting for differences in alignment difficulty. In this work, we propose a prompt-adaptive strategy for Best-of-N alignment that allocates inference-time compute more efficiently. Motivated by latency concerns, we develop a two-stage algorithm: an initial exploratory phase estimates the reward distribution for each prompt using a small exploration budget, and a second stage adaptively allocates the remaining budget using these estimates. Our method is simple, practical, and compatible with any LM/RM combination. Empirical results on the AlpacaEval dataset for 12 LM/RM pairs and 50 different batches of prompts show that our adaptive strategy consistently outperforms the uniform allocation with the same inference budget. Moreover, our experiments show that our adaptive strategy remains competitive against uniform allocations with 20% larger inference budgets and even improves in performance as the batch size grows.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12050v1
Wisdom from Diversity: Bias Mitigation Through Hybrid Human-LLM Crowds,"Despite their performance, large language models (LLMs) can inadvertently perpetuate biases found in the data they are trained on. By analyzing LLM responses to bias-eliciting headlines, we find that these models often mirror human biases. To address this, we explore crowd-based strategies for mitigating bias through response aggregation. We first demonstrate that simply averaging responses from multiple LLMs, intended to leverage the ""wisdom of the crowd"", can exacerbate existing biases due to the limited diversity within LLM crowds. In contrast, we show that locally weighted aggregation methods more effectively leverage the wisdom of the LLM crowd, achieving both bias mitigation and improved accuracy. Finally, recognizing the complementary strengths of LLMs (accuracy) and humans (diversity), we demonstrate that hybrid crowds containing both significantly enhance performance and further reduce biases across ethnic and gender-related contexts.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12349v1
DGRO: Enhancing LLM Reasoning via Exploration-Exploitation Control and   Reward Variance Management,"Inference scaling further accelerates Large Language Models (LLMs) toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), with large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) to unleash long Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Most contemporary reasoning approaches usually rely on handcrafted rule-based reward functions. However, the tarde-offs of exploration and exploitation in RL algorithms involves multiple complex considerations, and the theoretical and empirical impacts of manually designed reward functions remain insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Group Reward Optimization (DGRO), a general RL algorithm for LLM reasoning. On the one hand, DGRO decouples the traditional regularization coefficient into two independent hyperparameters: one scales the policy gradient term, and the other regulates the distance from the sampling policy. This decoupling not only enables precise control over balancing exploration and exploitation, but also can be seamlessly extended to Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) algorithms in Kimi k1.5 and Direct Reward Optimization. On the other hand, we observe that reward variance significantly affects both convergence speed and final model performance. We conduct both theoretical analysis and extensive empirical validation to assess DGRO, including a detailed ablation study that investigates its performance and optimization dynamics. Experimental results show that DGRO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Logic dataset with an average accuracy of 96.9\%, and demonstrates strong generalization across mathematical benchmarks.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12951v1
StarFT: Robust Fine-tuning of Zero-shot Models via Spuriosity Alignment,"Learning robust representations from data often requires scale, which has led to the success of recent zero-shot models such as CLIP. However, the obtained robustness can easily be deteriorated when these models are fine-tuned on other downstream tasks (e.g., of smaller scales). Previous works often interpret this phenomenon in the context of domain shift, developing fine-tuning methods that aim to preserve the original domain as much as possible. However, in a different context, fine-tuned models with limited data are also prone to learning features that are spurious to humans, such as background or texture. In this paper, we propose StarFT (Spurious Textual Alignment Regularization), a novel framework for fine-tuning zero-shot models to enhance robustness by preventing them from learning spuriosity. We introduce a regularization that aligns the output distribution for spuriosity-injected labels with the original zero-shot model, ensuring that the model is not induced to extract irrelevant features further from these descriptions.We leverage recent language models to get such spuriosity-injected labels by generating alternative textual descriptions that highlight potentially confounding features.Extensive experiments validate the robust generalization of StarFT and its emerging properties: zero-shot group robustness and improved zero-shot classification. Notably, StarFT boosts both worst-group and average accuracy by 14.30% and 3.02%, respectively, in the Waterbirds group shift scenario, where other robust fine-tuning baselines show even degraded performance.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13232v1
MARVEL: Multi-Agent RTL Vulnerability Extraction using Large Language   Models,"Hardware security verification is a challenging and time-consuming task. For this purpose, design engineers may utilize tools such as formal verification, linters, and functional simulation tests, coupled with analysis and a deep understanding of the hardware design being inspected. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to assist during this task, either directly or in conjunction with existing tools. We improve the state of the art by proposing MARVEL, a multi-agent LLM framework for a unified approach to decision-making, tool use, and reasoning. MARVEL mimics the cognitive process of a designer looking for security vulnerabilities in RTL code. It consists of a supervisor agent that devises the security policy of the system-on-chips (SoCs) using its security documentation. It delegates tasks to validate the security policy to individual executor agents. Each executor agent carries out its assigned task using a particular strategy. Each executor agent may use one or more tools to identify potential security bugs in the design and send the results back to the supervisor agent for further analysis and confirmation. MARVEL includes executor agents that leverage formal tools, linters, simulation tests, LLM-based detection schemes, and static analysis-based checks. We test our approach on a known buggy SoC based on OpenTitan from the Hack@DATE competition. We find that 20 of the 48 issues reported by MARVEL pose security vulnerabilities.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11963v1
Advancing Generalization Across a Variety of Abstract Visual Reasoning   Tasks,"The abstract visual reasoning (AVR) domain presents a diverse suite of analogy-based tasks devoted to studying model generalization. Recent years have brought dynamic progress in the field, particularly in i.i.d. scenarios, in which models are trained and evaluated on the same data distributions. Nevertheless, o.o.d. setups that assess model generalization to new test distributions remain challenging even for the most recent models. To advance generalization in AVR tasks, we present the Pathways of Normalized Group Convolution model (PoNG), a novel neural architecture that features group convolution, normalization, and a parallel design. We consider a wide set of AVR benchmarks, including Raven's Progressive Matrices and visual analogy problems with both synthetic and real-world images. The experiments demonstrate strong generalization capabilities of the proposed model, which in several settings outperforms the existing literature methods.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13391v1
Level Generation with Quantum Reservoir Computing,"Reservoir computing is a form of machine learning particularly suited for time series analysis, including forecasting predictions. We take an implementation of \emph{quantum} reservoir computing that was initially designed to generate variants of musical scores and adapt it to create levels of Super Mario Bros. Motivated by our analysis of these levels, we develop a new Roblox \textit{obby} where the courses can be generated in real time on superconducting qubit hardware, and investigate some of the constraints placed by such real-time generation.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13287v1
Unveil Sources of Uncertainty: Feature Contribution to Conformal   Prediction Intervals,"Cooperative game theory methods, notably Shapley values, have significantly enhanced machine learning (ML) interpretability. However, existing explainable AI (XAI) frameworks mainly attribute average model predictions, overlooking predictive uncertainty. This work addresses that gap by proposing a novel, model-agnostic uncertainty attribution (UA) method grounded in conformal prediction (CP). By defining cooperative games where CP interval properties-such as width and bounds-serve as value functions, we systematically attribute predictive uncertainty to input features. Extending beyond the traditional Shapley values, we use the richer class of Harsanyi allocations, and in particular the proportional Shapley values, which distribute attribution proportionally to feature importance. We propose a Monte Carlo approximation method with robust statistical guarantees to address computational feasibility, significantly improving runtime efficiency. Our comprehensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate the practical utility and interpretative depth of our approach. By combining cooperative game theory and conformal prediction, we offer a rigorous, flexible toolkit for understanding and communicating predictive uncertainty in high-stakes ML applications.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13118v1
AdaCoT: Pareto-Optimal Adaptive Chain-of-Thought Triggering via   Reinforcement Learning,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but often face challenges with tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly enhances reasoning, it indiscriminately generates lengthy reasoning steps for all queries, leading to substantial computational costs and inefficiency, especially for simpler inputs. To address this critical issue, we introduce AdaCoT (Adaptive Chain-of-Thought), a novel framework enabling LLMs to adaptively decide when to invoke CoT. AdaCoT framed adaptive reasoning as a Pareto optimization problem that seeks to balance model performance with the costs associated with CoT invocation (both frequency and computational overhead). We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based method, specifically utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to dynamically control the CoT triggering decision boundary by adjusting penalty coefficients, thereby allowing the model to determine CoT necessity based on implicit query complexity. A key technical contribution is Selective Loss Masking (SLM), designed to counteract decision boundary collapse during multi-stage RL training, ensuring robust and stable adaptive triggering. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaCoT successfully navigates the Pareto frontier, achieving substantial reductions in CoT usage for queries not requiring elaborate reasoning. For instance, on our production traffic testset, AdaCoT reduced CoT triggering rates to as low as 3.18\% and decreased average response tokens by 69.06%, while maintaining high performance on complex tasks.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11896v1
Demystifying and Enhancing the Efficiency of Large Language Model Based   Search Agents,"Large Language Model (LLM)-based search agents have shown remarkable capabilities in solving complex tasks by dynamically decomposing problems and addressing them through interleaved reasoning and retrieval. However, this interleaved paradigm introduces substantial efficiency bottlenecks. First, we observe that both highly accurate and overly approximate retrieval methods degrade system efficiency: exact search incurs significant retrieval overhead, while coarse retrieval requires additional reasoning steps during generation. Second, we identify inefficiencies in system design, including improper scheduling and frequent retrieval stalls, which lead to cascading latency -- where even minor delays in retrieval amplify end-to-end inference time. To address these challenges, we introduce SearchAgent-X, a high-efficiency inference framework for LLM-based search agents. SearchAgent-X leverages high-recall approximate retrieval and incorporates two key techniques: priority-aware scheduling and non-stall retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SearchAgent-X consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems such as vLLM and HNSW-based retrieval across diverse tasks, achieving up to 3.4$\times$ higher throughput and 5$\times$ lower latency, without compromising generation quality. SearchAgent-X is available at https://github.com/tiannuo-yang/SearchAgent-X.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12065v1
"CPRet: A Dataset, Benchmark, and Model for Retrieval in Competitive   Programming","Competitive programming benchmarks are widely used in scenarios such as programming contests and large language model assessments. However, the growing presence of duplicate or highly similar problems raises concerns not only about competition fairness, but also about the validity of competitive programming as a benchmark for model evaluation. In this paper, we propose a new problem -- similar question retrieval -- to address this issue. Due to the lack of both data and models, solving this problem is challenging. To this end, we introduce CPRet, a retrieval-oriented benchmark suite for competitive programming, covering four retrieval tasks: two code-centric (i.e., Text-to-Code and Code-to-Code) and two newly proposed problem-centric tasks (i.e., Problem-to-Duplicate and Simplified-to-Full), built from a combination of automatically crawled problem-solution data and manually curated annotations. Our contribution includes both high-quality training data and temporally separated test sets for reliable evaluation. In addition, we develop two task-specialized retrievers based on this dataset: CPRetriever-Code, trained with a novel Group-InfoNCE loss for problem-code alignment, and CPRetriever-Prob, fine-tuned for identifying problem-level similarity. Both models achieve strong results and are open-sourced for local use. Finally, we analyze LiveCodeBench and find that high-similarity problems inflate model pass rates and reduce differentiation, underscoring the need for similarity-aware evaluation in future benchmarks.

Benchmarking and Confidence Evaluation of LALMs For Temporal Reasoning,"The popular success of text-based large language models (LLM) has streamlined the attention of the multimodal community to combine other modalities like vision and audio along with text to achieve similar multimodal capabilities. In this quest, large audio language models (LALMs) have to be evaluated on reasoning related tasks which are different from traditional classification or generation tasks. Towards this goal, we propose a novel dataset called temporal reasoning evaluation of audio (TREA).   We benchmark open-source LALMs and observe that they are consistently behind human capabilities on the tasks in the TREA dataset. While evaluating LALMs, we also propose an uncertainty metric, which computes the invariance of the model to semantically identical perturbations of the input. Our analysis shows that the accuracy and uncertainty metrics are not necessarily correlated and thus, points to a need for wholesome evaluation of LALMs for high-stakes applications.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13115v1
"Trust, But Verify: A Self-Verification Approach to Reinforcement   Learning with Verifiable Rewards","Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise in complex reasoning, with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) being a key enhancement strategy. However, a prevalent issue is ``superficial self-reflection'', where models fail to robustly verify their own outputs. We introduce RISE (Reinforcing Reasoning with Self-Verification), a novel online RL framework designed to tackle this. RISE explicitly and simultaneously trains an LLM to improve both its problem-solving and self-verification abilities within a single, integrated RL process. The core mechanism involves leveraging verifiable rewards from an outcome verifier to provide on-the-fly feedback for both solution generation and self-verification tasks. In each iteration, the model generates solutions, then critiques its own on-policy generated solutions, with both trajectories contributing to the policy update. Extensive experiments on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that RISE consistently improves model's problem-solving accuracy while concurrently fostering strong self-verification skills. Our analyses highlight the advantages of online verification and the benefits of increased verification compute. Additionally, RISE models exhibit more frequent and accurate self-verification behaviors during reasoning. These advantages reinforce RISE as a flexible and effective path towards developing more robust and self-aware reasoners.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13445v1
ModernGBERT: German-only 1B Encoder Model Trained from Scratch,"Despite the prominence of decoder-only language models, encoders remain crucial for resource-constrained applications.

To evaluate the practical trade-offs of training encoders from scratch, we also present LL\""aMmlein2Vec (120M, 1B, 7B), a family of encoders derived from German decoder-only models via LLM2Vec. We benchmark all models on natural language understanding, text embedding, and long-context reasoning tasks, enabling a controlled comparison between dedicated encoders and converted decoders. Our results show that ModernGBERT 1B outperforms prior state-of-the-art German encoders as well as encoders adapted via LLM2Vec, with regard to performance and parameter-efficiency. All models, training data, checkpoints and code are publicly available, advancing the German NLP ecosystem with transparent, high-performance encoder models.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13136v1
Multilingual Prompt Engineering in Large Language Models: A Survey   Across NLP Tasks,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, ensuring their effectiveness across multiple languages presents unique challenges. Multilingual prompt engineering has emerged as a key approach to enhance LLMs' capabilities in diverse linguistic settings without requiring extensive parameter re-training or fine-tuning. With growing interest in multilingual prompt engineering over the past two to three years, researchers have explored various strategies to improve LLMs' performance across languages and NLP tasks. By crafting structured natural language prompts, researchers have successfully extracted knowledge from LLMs across different languages, making these techniques an accessible pathway for a broader audience, including those without deep expertise in machine learning, to harness the capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we survey and categorize different multilingual prompting techniques based on the NLP tasks they address across a diverse set of datasets that collectively span around 250 languages. We further highlight the LLMs employed, present a taxonomy of approaches and discuss potential state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods for specific multilingual datasets. Additionally, we derive a range of insights across language families and resource levels (high-resource vs. low-resource), including analyses such as the distribution of NLP tasks by language resource type and the frequency of prompting methods across different language families. Our survey reviews 36 research papers covering 39 prompting techniques applied to 30 multilingual NLP tasks, with the majority of these studies published in the last two years.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11665v1
BeliefNest: A Joint Action Simulator for Embodied Agents with Theory of   Mind,"This paper introduces an open-source simulator, BeliefNest, designed to enable embodied agents to perform collaborative tasks by leveraging Theory of Mind. BeliefNest dynamically and hierarchically constructs simulators within a Minecraft environment, allowing agents to explicitly represent nested belief states about themselves and others. This enables agent control in open-domain tasks that require Theory of Mind reasoning. The simulator provides a prompt generation mechanism based on each belief state, facilitating the design and evaluation of methods for agent control utilizing large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate through experiments that agents can infer others' beliefs and predict their belief-based actions in false-belief tasks.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12321v1
Safe Delta: Consistently Preserving Safety when Fine-Tuning LLMs on   Diverse Datasets,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential as general-purpose AI assistants across various domains. To fully leverage this potential in specific applications, many companies provide fine-tuning API services, enabling users to upload their own data for LLM customization. However, fine-tuning services introduce a new safety threat: user-uploaded data, whether harmful or benign, can break the model's alignment, leading to unsafe outputs. Moreover, existing defense methods struggle to address the diversity of fine-tuning datasets (e.g., varying sizes, tasks), often sacrificing utility for safety or vice versa. To address this issue, we propose Safe Delta, a safety-aware post-training defense method that adjusts the delta parameters (i.e., the parameter change before and after fine-tuning). Specifically, Safe Delta estimates the safety degradation, selects delta parameters to maximize utility while limiting overall safety loss, and applies a safety compensation vector to mitigate residual safety loss. Through extensive experiments on four diverse datasets with varying settings, our approach consistently preserves safety while ensuring that the utility gain from benign datasets remains unaffected.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12038v1
FedSVD: Adaptive Orthogonalization for Private Federated Learning with   LoRA,"Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which introduces a product of two trainable low-rank matrices into frozen pre-trained weights, is widely used for efficient fine-tuning of language models in federated learning (FL). However, when combined with differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), LoRA faces substantial noise amplification: DP-SGD perturbs per-sample gradients, and the matrix multiplication of the LoRA update ($BA$) intensifies this effect. Freezing one matrix (e.g., $A$) reduces the noise but restricts model expressiveness, often resulting in suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we propose FedSVD, a simple yet effective method that introduces a global reparameterization based on singular value decomposition (SVD). In our approach, each client optimizes only the $B$ matrix and transmits it to the server. The server aggregates the $B$ matrices, computes the product $BA$ using the previous $A$, and refactorizes the result via SVD. This yields a new adaptive $A$ composed of the orthonormal right singular vectors of $BA$, and an updated $B$ containing the remaining SVD components. This reparameterization avoids quadratic noise amplification, while allowing $A$ to better capture the principal directions of the aggregate updates. Moreover, the orthonormal structure of $A$ bounds the gradient norms of $B$ and preserves more signal under DP-SGD, as confirmed by our theoretical analysis. As a result, FedSVD consistently improves stability and performance across a variety of privacy settings and benchmarks, outperforming relevant baselines under both private and non-private regimes.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12805v1
SGDPO: Self-Guided Direct Preference Optimization for Language Model   Alignment,"Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is broadly utilized for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values because of its flexibility. Despite its effectiveness, it has been observed that the capability of DPO to generate human-preferred response is limited and the results of DPO are far from resilient. To address these limitations, in this paper we propose a novel Self-Guided Direct Preference Optimization algorithm, i.e., SGDPO, which incorporates a pilot term to steer the gradient flow during the optimization process, allowing for fine-grained control over the updates of chosen and rejected rewards. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of our proposed method and elucidate its operational mechanism. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments on various models and benchmarks. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the consistency between the empirical results and our theoretical analysis and confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach (up to 9.19% higher score).",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12435v1
J4R: Learning to Judge with Equivalent Initial State Group Relative   Preference Optimization,"To keep pace with the increasing pace of large language models (LLM) development, model output evaluation has transitioned away from time-consuming human evaluation to automatic evaluation, where LLMs themselves are tasked with assessing and critiquing other model outputs. LLM-as-judge models are a class of generative evaluators that excel in evaluating relatively simple domains, like chat quality, but struggle in reasoning intensive domains where model responses contain more substantive and challenging content. To remedy existing judge shortcomings, we explore training judges with reinforcement learning (RL). We make three key contributions: (1) We propose the Equivalent Initial State Group Relative Policy Optimization (EIS-GRPO) algorithm, which allows us to train our judge to be robust to positional biases that arise in more complex evaluation settings. (2) We introduce ReasoningJudgeBench, a benchmark that evaluates judges in diverse reasoning settings not covered by prior work. (3) We train Judge for Reasoning (J4R), a 7B judge trained with EIS-GRPO that outperforms GPT-4o and the next best small judge by 6.7% and 9%, matching or exceeding the performance of larger GRPO-trained judges on both JudgeBench and ReasoningJudgeBench.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13346v1
Segmentation of temporomandibular joint structures on mri images using   neural networks for diagnosis of pathologies,"This article explores the use of artificial intelligence for the diagnosis of pathologies of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), in particular, for the segmentation of the articular disc on MRI images. The relevance of the work is due to the high prevalence of TMJ pathologies, as well as the need to improve the accuracy and speed of diagnosis in medical institutions. During the study, the existing solutions (Diagnocat, MandSeg) were analyzed, which, as a result, are not suitable for studying the articular disc due to the orientation towards bone structures. To solve the problem, an original dataset was collected from 94 images with the classes ""temporomandibular joint"" and ""jaw"". To increase the amount of data, augmentation methods were used. After that, the models of U-Net, YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n and Roboflow neural networks were trained and compared. The evaluation was carried out according to the Dice Score, Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Mean Average Precision metrics. The results confirm the potential of using the Roboflow model for segmentation of the temporomandibular joint. In the future, it is planned to develop an algorithm for measuring the distance between the jaws and determining the position of the articular disc, which will improve the diagnosis of TMJ pathologies.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12963v1
Pre-trained Prompt-driven Community Search,"The ""pre-train, prompt"" paradigm is widely adopted in various graph-based tasks and has shown promising performance in community detection. Most existing semi-supervised community detection algorithms detect communities based on known ones, and the detected communities typically do not contain the given query node. Therefore, they are not suitable for searching the community of a given node. Motivated by this, we adopt this paradigm into the semi-supervised community search for the first time and propose Pre-trained Prompt-driven Community Search (PPCS), a novel model designed to enhance search accuracy and efficiency. PPCS consists of three main components: node encoding, sample generation, and prompt-driven fine-tuning. Specifically, the node encoding component employs graph neural networks to learn local structural patterns of nodes in a graph, thereby obtaining representations for nodes and communities. Next, the sample generation component identifies an initial community for a given node and selects known communities that are structurally similar to the initial one as training samples. Finally, the prompt-driven fine-tuning component leverages these samples as prompts to guide the final community prediction. Experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that PPCS performs better than baseline algorithms. It also achieves higher community search efficiency than semi-supervised community search baseline methods, with ablation studies verifying the effectiveness of each component of PPCS.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12304v1
Enhancing Knowledge Graph Completion with GNN Distillation and   Probabilistic Interaction Modeling,"Knowledge graphs (KGs) serve as fundamental structures for organizing interconnected data across diverse domains. However, most KGs remain incomplete, limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications. Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to address this issue by inferring missing links, but existing methods face critical challenges: deep graph neural networks (GNNs) suffer from over-smoothing, while embedding-based models fail to capture abstract relational features. This study aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a unified framework that integrates GNN distillation and abstract probabilistic interaction modeling (APIM). GNN distillation approach introduces an iterative message-feature filtering process to mitigate over-smoothing, preserving the discriminative power of node representations. APIM module complements this by learning structured, abstract interaction patterns through probabilistic signatures and transition matrices, allowing for a richer, more flexible representation of entity and relation interactions. We apply these methods to GNN-based models and the APIM to embedding-based KGC models, conducting extensive evaluations on the widely used WN18RR and FB15K-237 datasets. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains over baseline models, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The findings highlight the importance of both controlling information propagation and leveraging structured probabilistic modeling, offering new avenues for advancing knowledge graph completion. And our codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/APIM_and_GNN-Distillation-461C.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12272v1
Counterfactual Explanations for Continuous Action Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great promise in domains like healthcare and robotics but often struggles with adoption due to its lack of interpretability. Counterfactual explanations, which address ""what if"" scenarios, provide a promising avenue for understanding RL decisions but remain underexplored for continuous action spaces. We propose a novel approach for generating counterfactual explanations in continuous action RL by computing alternative action sequences that improve outcomes while minimizing deviations from the original sequence. Our approach leverages a distance metric for continuous actions and accounts for constraints such as adhering to predefined policies in specific states. Evaluations in two RL domains, Diabetes Control and Lunar Lander, demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization of our approach, enabling more interpretable and trustworthy RL applications.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12701v1
"Unified Cross-modal Translation of Score Images, Symbolic Music, and   Performance Audio","Music exists in various modalities, such as score images, symbolic scores, MIDI, and audio. Translations between each modality are established as core tasks of music information retrieval, such as automatic music transcription (audio-to-MIDI) and optical music recognition (score image to symbolic score). However, most past work on multimodal translation trains specialized models on individual translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified approach, where we train a general-purpose model on many translation tasks simultaneously. Two key factors make this unified approach viable: a new large-scale dataset and the tokenization of each modality. Firstly, we propose a new dataset that consists of more than 1,300 hours of paired audio-score image data collected from YouTube videos, which is an order of magnitude larger than any existing music modal translation datasets. Secondly, our unified tokenization framework discretizes score images, audio, MIDI, and MusicXML into a sequence of tokens, enabling a single encoder-decoder Transformer to tackle multiple cross-modal translation as one coherent sequence-to-sequence task. Experimental results confirm that our unified multitask model improves upon single-task baselines in several key areas, notably reducing the symbol error rate for optical music recognition from 24.58% to a state-of-the-art 13.67%, while similarly substantial improvements are observed across the other translation tasks. Notably, our approach achieves the first successful score-image-conditioned audio generation, marking a significant breakthrough in cross-modal music generation.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12863v1
One-Step Offline Distillation of Diffusion-based Models via Koopman   Modeling,"Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional performance, yet their iterative sampling procedures remain computationally expensive. A prominent strategy to mitigate this cost is distillation, with offline distillation offering particular advantages in terms of efficiency, modularity, and flexibility. In this work, we identify two key observations that motivate a principled distillation framework: (1) while diffusion models have been viewed through the lens of dynamical systems theory, powerful and underexplored tools can be further leveraged; and (2) diffusion models inherently impose structured, semantically coherent trajectories in latent space. Building on these observations, we introduce the Koopman Distillation Model KDM, a novel offline distillation approach grounded in Koopman theory-a classical framework for representing nonlinear dynamics linearly in a transformed space. KDM encodes noisy inputs into an embedded space where a learned linear operator propagates them forward, followed by a decoder that reconstructs clean samples. This enables single-step generation while preserving semantic fidelity. We provide theoretical justification for our approach: (1) under mild assumptions, the learned diffusion dynamics admit a finite-dimensional Koopman representation; and (2) proximity in the Koopman latent space correlates with semantic similarity in the generated outputs, allowing for effective trajectory alignment. Empirically, KDM achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard offline distillation benchmarks, improving FID scores by up to 40% in a single generation step. All implementation details and code for the experimental setups are provided in our GitHub - https://github.com/azencot-group/KDM, or in our project page - https://sites.google.com/view/koopman-distillation-model.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13358v1
ChromFound: Towards A Universal Foundation Model for Single-Cell   Chromatin Accessibility Data,"The advent of single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) offers an innovative perspective for deciphering regulatory mechanisms by assembling a vast repository of single-cell chromatin accessibility data. While foundation models have achieved significant success in single-cell transcriptomics, there is currently no foundation model for scATAC-seq that supports zero-shot high-quality cell identification and comprehensive multi-omics analysis simultaneously. Key challenges lie in the high dimensionality and sparsity of scATAC-seq data, as well as the lack of a standardized schema for representing open chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we present \textbf{ChromFound}, a foundation model tailored for scATAC-seq. ChromFound utilizes a hybrid architecture and genome-aware tokenization to effectively capture genome-wide long contexts and regulatory signals from dynamic chromatin landscapes. Pretrained on 1.97 million cells from 30 tissues and 6 disease conditions, ChromFound demonstrates broad applicability across 6 diverse tasks.

SafeVid: Toward Safety Aligned Video Large Multimodal Models,"As Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) rapidly advance, their inherent complexity introduces significant safety challenges, particularly the issue of mismatched generalization where static safety alignments fail to transfer to dynamic video contexts. We introduce SafeVid, a framework designed to instill video-specific safety principles in VLMMs. SafeVid uniquely transfers robust textual safety alignment capabilities to the video domain by employing detailed textual video descriptions as an interpretive bridge, facilitating LLM-based rule-driven safety reasoning. This is achieved through a closed-loop system comprising: 1) generation of SafeVid-350K, a novel 350,000-pair video-specific safety preference dataset; 2) targeted alignment of VLMMs using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO); and 3) comprehensive evaluation via our new SafeVidBench benchmark. Alignment with SafeVid-350K significantly enhances VLMM safety, with models like LLaVA-NeXT-Video demonstrating substantial improvements (e.g., up to 42.39%) on SafeVidBench. SafeVid provides critical resources and a structured approach, demonstrating that leveraging textual descriptions as a conduit for safety reasoning markedly improves the safety alignment of VLMMs. We have made SafeVid-350K dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/yxwang/SafeVid-350K) publicly available.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11926v1
KIT's Offline Speech Translation and Instruction Following Submission   for IWSLT 2025,"The scope of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT) has recently broadened beyond traditional Speech Translation (ST) to encompass a wider array of tasks, including Speech Question Answering and Summarization. This shift is partly driven by the growing capabilities of modern systems, particularly with the success of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we present the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology's submissions for the Offline ST and Instruction Following (IF) tracks, where we leverage LLMs to enhance performance across all tasks. For the Offline ST track, we propose a pipeline that employs multiple automatic speech recognition systems, whose outputs are fused using an LLM with document-level context. This is followed by a two-step translation process, incorporating additional refinement step to improve translation quality. For the IF track, we develop an end-to-end model that integrates a speech encoder with an LLM to perform a wide range of instruction-following tasks. We complement it with a final document-level refinement stage to further enhance output quality by using contextual information.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13036v1
Enhancing Channel-Independent Time-Series Forecasting via Cross-Variate   Patch Embedding,"Transformers have recently gained popularity in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies. However, many existing models focus only on capturing temporal dependencies while omitting intricate relationships between variables. Recent models have tried tackling this by explicitly modeling both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies through a sequential or unified attention mechanism, but they are entirely channel dependent (CD) across all layers, making them potentially susceptible to overfitting. To address this, we propose Cross-Variate Patch Embeddings (CVPE), a lightweight CD module that injects cross-variate context into channel-independent (CI) models by simply modifying the patch embedding process. We achieve this by adding a learnable positional encoding and a lightweight router-attention block to the vanilla patch embedding layer. We then integrate CVPE into Time-LLM, a multimodal CI forecasting model, to demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing cross-variate dependencies and enhance the CI model's performance. Extensive experimental results on seven real-world datasets show that our enhanced Time-LLM outperforms the original baseline model simply by incorporating the CVPE module, with no other changes.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12761v1
Adaptive MPC-based quadrupedal robot control under periodic disturbances,"Recent advancements in adaptive control for reference trajectory tracking enable quadrupedal robots to perform locomotion tasks under challenging conditions. There are methods enabling the estimation of the external disturbances in terms of forces and torques. However, a specific case of disturbances that are periodic was not explicitly tackled in application to quadrupeds. This work is devoted to the estimation of the periodic disturbances with a lightweight regressor using simplified robot dynamics and extracting the disturbance properties in terms of the magnitude and frequency. Experimental evidence suggests performance improvement over the baseline static disturbance compensation. All source files, including simulation setups, code, and calculation scripts, are available on GitHub at https://github.com/aidagroup/quad-periodic-mpc.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12361v1
From Grunts to Grammar: Emergent Language from Cooperative Foraging,"Early cavemen relied on gestures, vocalizations, and simple signals to coordinate, plan, avoid predators, and share resources. Today, humans collaborate using complex languages to achieve remarkable results. What drives this evolution in communication? How does language emerge, adapt, and become vital for teamwork? Understanding the origins of language remains a challenge. A leading hypothesis in linguistics and anthropology posits that language evolved to meet the ecological and social demands of early human cooperation. Language did not arise in isolation, but through shared survival goals. Inspired by this view, we investigate the emergence of language in multi-agent Foraging Games. These environments are designed to reflect the cognitive and ecological constraints believed to have influenced the evolution of communication. Agents operate in a shared grid world with only partial knowledge about other agents and the environment, and must coordinate to complete games like picking up high-value targets or executing temporally ordered actions. Using end-to-end deep reinforcement learning, agents learn both actions and communication strategies from scratch. We find that agents develop communication protocols with hallmark features of natural language: arbitrariness, interchangeability, displacement, cultural transmission, and compositionality. We quantify each property and analyze how different factors, such as population size and temporal dependencies, shape specific aspects of the emergent language. Our framework serves as a platform for studying how language can evolve from partial observability, temporal reasoning, and cooperative goals in embodied multi-agent settings. We will release all data, code, and models publicly.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12872v1
Always Clear Depth: Robust Monocular Depth Estimation under Adverse   Weather,"Monocular depth estimation is critical for applications such as autonomous driving and scene reconstruction. While existing methods perform well under normal scenarios, their performance declines in adverse weather, due to challenging domain shifts and difficulties in extracting scene information. To address this issue, we present a robust monocular depth estimation method called \textbf{ACDepth} from the perspective of high-quality training data generation and domain adaptation. Specifically, we introduce a one-step diffusion model for generating samples that simulate adverse weather conditions, constructing a multi-tuple degradation dataset during training. To ensure the quality of the generated degradation samples, we employ LoRA adapters to fine-tune the generation weights of diffusion model. Additionally, we integrate circular consistency loss and adversarial training to guarantee the fidelity and naturalness of the scene contents. Furthermore, we elaborate on a multi-granularity knowledge distillation strategy (MKD) that encourages the student network to absorb knowledge from both the teacher model and pretrained Depth Anything V2. This strategy guides the student model in learning degradation-agnostic scene information from various degradation inputs. In particular, we introduce an ordinal guidance distillation mechanism (OGD) that encourages the network to focus on uncertain regions through differential ranking, leading to a more precise depth estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our ACDepth surpasses md4all-DD by 2.50\% for night scene and 2.61\% for rainy scene on the nuScenes dataset in terms of the absRel metric.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12199v1
HyperDet: Source Detection in Hypergraphs via Interactive Relationship   Construction and Feature-rich Attention Fusion,"Hypergraphs offer superior modeling capabilities for social networks, particularly in capturing group phenomena that extend beyond pairwise interactions in rumor propagation. Existing approaches in rumor source detection predominantly focus on dyadic interactions, which inadequately address the complexity of more intricate relational structures. In this study, we present a novel approach for Source Detection in Hypergraphs (HyperDet) via Interactive Relationship Construction and Feature-rich Attention Fusion. Specifically, our methodology employs an Interactive Relationship Construction module to accurately model both the static topology and dynamic interactions among users, followed by the Feature-rich Attention Fusion module, which autonomously learns node features and discriminates between nodes using a self-attention mechanism, thereby effectively learning node representations under the framework of accurately modeled higher-order relationships. Extensive experimental validation confirms the efficacy of our HyperDet approach, showcasing its superiority relative to current state-of-the-art methods.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12894v1
Shadow-FT: Tuning Instruct via Base,"Large language models (LLMs) consistently benefit from further fine-tuning on various tasks. However, we observe that directly tuning the INSTRUCT (i.e., instruction tuned) models often leads to marginal improvements and even performance degeneration. Notably, paired BASE models, the foundation for these INSTRUCT variants, contain highly similar weight values (i.e., less than 2% on average for Llama 3.1 8B). Therefore, we propose a novel Shadow-FT framework to tune the INSTRUCT models by leveraging the corresponding BASE models. The key insight is to fine-tune the BASE model, and then directly graft the learned weight updates to the INSTRUCT model. Our proposed Shadow-FT introduces no additional parameters, is easy to implement, and significantly improves performance. We conduct extensive experiments on tuning mainstream LLMs, such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3 series, and evaluate them across 19 benchmarks covering coding, reasoning, and mathematical tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Shadow-FT consistently outperforms conventional full-parameter and parameter-efficient tuning approaches. Further analyses indicate that Shadow-FT can be applied to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and combined with direct preference optimization (DPO). Codes and weights are available at \href{https://github.com/wutaiqiang/Shadow-FT}{Github}.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12716v1
CorBenchX: Large-Scale Chest X-Ray Error Dataset and Vision-Language   Model Benchmark for Report Error Correction,"AI-driven models have shown great promise in detecting errors in radiology reports, yet the field lacks a unified benchmark for rigorous evaluation of error detection and further correction. To address this gap, we introduce CorBenchX, a comprehensive suite for automated error detection and correction in chest X-ray reports, designed to advance AI-assisted quality control in clinical practice. We first synthesize a large-scale dataset of 26,326 chest X-ray error reports by injecting clinically common errors via prompting DeepSeek-R1, with each corrupted report paired with its original text, error type, and human-readable description. Leveraging this dataset, we benchmark both open- and closed-source vision-language models,(e.g., InternVL, Qwen-VL, GPT-4o, o4-mini, and Claude-3.7) for error detection and correction under zero-shot prompting. Among these models, o4-mini achieves the best performance, with 50.6 % detection accuracy and correction scores of BLEU 0.853, ROUGE 0.924, BERTScore 0.981, SembScore 0.865, and CheXbertF1 0.954, remaining below clinical-level accuracy, highlighting the challenge of precise report correction. To advance the state of the art, we propose a multi-step reinforcement learning (MSRL) framework that optimizes a multi-objective reward combining format compliance, error-type accuracy, and BLEU similarity. We apply MSRL to QwenVL2.5-7B, the top open-source model in our benchmark, achieving an improvement of 38.3% in single-error detection precision and 5.2% in single-error correction over the zero-shot baseline.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12057v1
IDEAL: Data Equilibrium Adaptation for Multi-Capability Language Model   Alignment,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance through Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) on diverse instructional datasets. When training on multiple capabilities simultaneously, the mixture training dataset, governed by volumes of data from different domains, is a critical factor that directly impacts the final model's performance. Unlike many studies that focus on enhancing the quality of training datasets through data selection methods, few works explore the intricate relationship between the compositional quantity of mixture training datasets and the emergent capabilities of LLMs. Given the availability of a high-quality multi-domain training dataset, understanding the impact of data from each domain on the model's overall capabilities is crucial for preparing SFT data and training a well-balanced model that performs effectively across diverse domains. In this work, we introduce IDEAL, an innovative data equilibrium adaptation framework designed to effectively optimize volumes of data from different domains within mixture SFT datasets, thereby enhancing the model's alignment and performance across multiple capabilities. IDEAL employs a gradient-based approach to iteratively refine the training data distribution, dynamically adjusting the volumes of domain-specific data based on their impact on downstream task performance. By leveraging this adaptive mechanism, IDEAL ensures a balanced dataset composition, enabling the model to achieve robust generalization and consistent proficiency across diverse tasks. Experiments across different capabilities demonstrate that IDEAL outperforms conventional uniform data allocation strategies, achieving a comprehensive improvement of approximately 7% in multi-task evaluation scores.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12762v1
PeerGuard: Defending Multi-Agent Systems Against Backdoor Attacks   Through Mutual Reasoning,"Multi-agent systems leverage advanced AI models as autonomous agents that interact, cooperate, or compete to complete complex tasks across applications such as robotics and traffic management. Despite their growing importance, safety in multi-agent systems remains largely underexplored, with most research focusing on single AI models rather than interacting agents. This work investigates backdoor vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems and proposes a defense mechanism based on agent interactions. By leveraging reasoning abilities, each agent evaluates responses from others to detect illogical reasoning processes, which indicate poisoned agents. Experiments on LLM-based multi-agent systems, including ChatGPT series and Llama 3, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving high accuracy in identifying poisoned agents while minimizing false positives on clean agents. We believe this work provides insights into multi-agent system safety and contributes to the development of robust, trustworthy AI interactions.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11642v1
LiBOG: Lifelong Learning for Black-Box Optimizer Generation,"Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) garners attention due to its success in automating the configuration and generation of black-box optimizers, significantly reducing the human effort required for optimizer design and discovering optimizers with higher performance than classic human-designed optimizers. However, existing MetaBBO methods conduct one-off training under the assumption that a stationary problem distribution with extensive and representative training problem samples is pre-available. This assumption is often impractical in real-world scenarios, where diverse problems following shifting distribution continually arise. Consequently, there is a pressing need for methods that can continuously learn from new problems encountered on-the-fly and progressively enhance their capabilities. In this work, we explore a novel paradigm of lifelong learning in MetaBBO and introduce LiBOG, a novel approach designed to learn from sequentially encountered problems and generate high-performance optimizers for Black-Box Optimization (BBO). LiBOG consolidates knowledge both across tasks and within tasks to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate LiBOG's effectiveness in learning to generate high-performance optimizers in a lifelong learning manner, addressing catastrophic forgetting while maintaining plasticity to learn new tasks.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13025v1
Structured Representation,"Invariant representations are core to representation learning, yet a central challenge remains: uncovering invariants that are stable and transferable without suppressing task-relevant signals. This raises fundamental questions, requiring further inquiry, about the appropriate level of abstraction at which such invariants should be defined, and which aspects of a system they should characterize. Interpretation of the environment relies on abstract knowledge structures to make sense of the current state, which leads to interactions, essential drivers of learning and knowledge acquisition. We posit that interpretation operates at the level of higher-order relational knowledge; hence, invariant structures must be where knowledge resides, specifically, as partitions defined by the closure of relational paths within an abstract knowledge space. These partitions serve as the core invariant representations, forming the structural substrate where knowledge is stored and learning occurs. On the other hand, inter-partition connectors enable the deployment of these knowledge partitions encoding task-relevant transitions. Thus, invariant partitions provide the foundational primitives of structured representation. We formalize the computational foundations for structured representation of the invariant partitions based on closed semiring, a relational algebraic structure.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12143v1
ViPlan: A Benchmark for Visual Planning with Symbolic Predicates and   Vision-Language Models,"Integrating Large Language Models with symbolic planners is a promising direction for obtaining verifiable and grounded plans compared to planning in natural language, with recent works extending this idea to visual domains using Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, rigorous comparison between VLM-grounded symbolic approaches and methods that plan directly with a VLM has been hindered by a lack of common environments, evaluation protocols and model coverage. We introduce ViPlan, the first open-source benchmark for Visual Planning with symbolic predicates and VLMs. ViPlan features a series of increasingly challenging tasks in two domains: a visual variant of the classic Blocksworld planning problem and a simulated household robotics environment. We benchmark nine open-source VLM families across multiple sizes, along with selected closed models, evaluating both VLM-grounded symbolic planning and using the models directly to propose actions. We find symbolic planning to outperform direct VLM planning in Blocksworld, where accurate image grounding is crucial, whereas the opposite is true in the household robotics tasks, where commonsense knowledge and the ability to recover from errors are beneficial. Finally, we show that across most models and methods, there is no significant benefit to using Chain-of-Thought prompting, suggesting that current VLMs still struggle with visual reasoning.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13180v1
How can Diffusion Models Evolve into Continual Generators?,"While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in static data generation, their deployment in streaming or continual learning (CL) scenarios faces a major challenge: catastrophic forgetting (CF), where newly acquired generative capabilities overwrite previously learned ones. To systematically address this, we introduce a formal Continual Diffusion Generation (CDG) paradigm that characterizes and redefines CL in the context of generative diffusion models. Prior efforts often adapt heuristic strategies from continual classification tasks but lack alignment with the underlying diffusion process. In this work, we develop the first theoretical framework for CDG by analyzing cross-task dynamics in diffusion-based generative modeling. Our analysis reveals that the retention and stability of generative knowledge across tasks are governed by three key consistency criteria: inter-task knowledge consistency (IKC), unconditional knowledge consistency (UKC), and label knowledge consistency (LKC). Building on these insights, we propose Continual Consistency Diffusion (CCD), a principled framework that integrates these consistency objectives into training via hierarchical loss terms $\mathcal{L}_{IKC}$, $\mathcal{L}_{UKC}$, and $\mathcal{L}_{LKC}$. This promotes effective knowledge retention while enabling the assimilation of new generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that CCD achieves state-of-the-art performance under continual settings, with substantial gains in Mean Fidelity (MF) and Incremental Mean Fidelity (IMF), particularly in tasks with rich cross-task knowledge overlap.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11936v1
Beyond Scalar Rewards: An Axiomatic Framework for Lexicographic MDPs,"Recent work has formalized the reward hypothesis through the lens of expected utility theory, by interpreting reward as utility. Hausner's foundational work showed that dropping the continuity axiom leads to a generalization of expected utility theory where utilities are lexicographically ordered vectors of arbitrary dimension. In this paper, we extend this result by identifying a simple and practical condition under which preferences cannot be represented by scalar rewards, necessitating a 2-dimensional reward function. We provide a full characterization of such reward functions, as well as the general d-dimensional case, in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) under a memorylessness assumption on preferences. Furthermore, we show that optimal policies in this setting retain many desirable properties of their scalar-reward counterparts, while in the Constrained MDP (CMDP) setting -- another common multiobjective setting -- they do not.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12049v1
Rethinking Optimal Verification Granularity for Compute-Efficient   Test-Time Scaling,"Test-time scaling (TTS) has proven effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Verification plays a key role in TTS, simultaneously influencing (1) reasoning performance and (2) compute efficiency, due to the quality and computational cost of verification. In this work, we challenge the conventional paradigms of verification, and make the first attempt toward systematically investigating the impact of verification granularity-that is, how frequently the verifier is invoked during generation, beyond verifying only the final output or individual generation steps. To this end, we introduce Variable Granularity Search (VG-Search), a unified algorithm that generalizes beam search and Best-of-N sampling via a tunable granularity parameter g. Extensive experiments with VG-Search under varying compute budgets, generator-verifier configurations, and task attributes reveal that dynamically selecting g can improve the compute efficiency and scaling behavior. Building on these findings, we propose adaptive VG-Search strategies that achieve accuracy gains of up to 3.1\% over Beam Search and 3.6\% over Best-of-N, while reducing FLOPs by over 52\%. We will open-source the code to support future research.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11730v1
FLTG: Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning via Angle-Based Defense and   Non-IID-Aware Weighting,"Byzantine attacks during model aggregation in Federated Learning (FL) threaten training integrity by manipulating malicious clients' updates. Existing methods struggle with limited robustness under high malicious client ratios and sensitivity to non-i.i.d. data, leading to degraded accuracy. To address this, we propose FLTG, a novel aggregation algorithm integrating angle-based defense and dynamic reference selection. FLTG first filters clients via ReLU-clipped cosine similarity, leveraging a server-side clean dataset to exclude misaligned updates. It then dynamically selects a reference client based on the prior global model to mitigate non-i.i.d. bias, assigns aggregation weights inversely proportional to angular deviations, and normalizes update magnitudes to suppress malicious scaling. Evaluations across datasets of varying complexity under five classic attacks demonstrate FLTG's superiority over state-of-the-art methods under extreme bias scenarios and sustains robustness with a higher proportion(over 50%) of malicious clients.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12851v1
Net-Zero: A Comparative Study on Neural Network Design for   Climate-Economic PDEs Under Uncertainty,"Climate-economic modeling under uncertainty presents significant computational challenges that may limit policymakers' ability to address climate change effectively. This paper explores neural network-based approaches for solving high-dimensional optimal control problems arising from models that incorporate ambiguity aversion in climate mitigation decisions. We develop a continuous-time endogenous-growth economic model that accounts for multiple mitigation pathways, including emission-free capital and carbon intensity reductions. Given the inherent complexity and high dimensionality of these models, traditional numerical methods become computationally intractable. We benchmark several neural network architectures against finite-difference generated solutions, evaluating their ability to capture the dynamic interactions between uncertainty, technology transitions, and optimal climate policy. Our findings demonstrate that appropriate neural architecture selection significantly impacts both solution accuracy and computational efficiency when modeling climate-economic systems under uncertainty. These methodological advances enable more sophisticated modeling of climate policy decisions, allowing for better representation of technology transitions and uncertainty-critical elements for developing effective mitigation strategies in the face of climate change.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13264v1
OMAC: A Broad Optimization Framework for LLM-Based Multi-Agent   Collaboration,"Agents powered by advanced large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse complex applications. Recently, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), wherein multiple agents collaborate and communicate with each other, have exhibited enhanced capabilities in complex tasks, such as high-quality code generation and arithmetic reasoning. However, the development of such systems often relies on handcrafted methods, and the literature on systematic design and optimization of LLM-based MAS remains limited.   In this work, we introduce OMAC, a general framework designed for holistic optimization of LLM-based MAS. Specifically, we identify five key optimization dimensions for MAS, encompassing both agent functionality and collaboration structure. Building upon these dimensions, we first propose a general algorithm, utilizing two actors termed the Semantic Initializer and the Contrastive Comparator, to optimize any single dimension. Then, we present an algorithm for joint optimization across multiple dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of OMAC on code generation, arithmetic reasoning, and general reasoning tasks against state-of-the-art approaches.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11765v1
SRLoRA: Subspace Recomposition in Low-Rank Adaptation via   Importance-Based Fusion and Reinitialization,"Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that injects two trainable low-rank matrices (A and B) into frozen pretrained models. While efficient, LoRA constrains updates to a fixed low-rank subspace (Delta W = BA), which can limit representational capacity and hinder downstream performance. We introduce Subspace Recomposition in Low-Rank Adaptation (SRLoRA) via importance-based fusion and reinitialization, a novel approach that enhances LoRA's expressiveness without compromising its lightweight structure. SRLoRA assigns importance scores to each LoRA pair (a column of B and the corresponding row of A), and dynamically recomposes the subspace during training. Less important pairs are fused into the frozen backbone, freeing capacity to reinitialize new pairs along unused principal directions derived from the pretrained weight's singular value decomposition. This mechanism enables continual subspace refreshment and richer adaptation over time, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. We evaluate SRLoRA on both language and vision tasks, including the GLUE benchmark and various image classification datasets. SRLoRA consistently achieves faster convergence and improved accuracy over standard LoRA, demonstrating its generality, efficiency, and potential for broader PEFT applications.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12433v1
Mixture Policy based Multi-Hop Reasoning over N-tuple Temporal Knowledge   Graphs,"Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which utilize quadruples in the form of (subject, predicate, object, timestamp) to describe temporal facts, have attracted extensive attention. N-tuple TKGs (N-TKGs) further extend traditional TKGs by utilizing n-tuples to incorporate auxiliary elements alongside core elements (i.e., subject, predicate, and object) of facts, so as to represent them in a more fine-grained manner. Reasoning over N-TKGs aims to predict potential future facts based on historical ones. However, existing N-TKG reasoning methods often lack explainability due to their black-box nature. Therefore, we introduce a new Reinforcement Learning-based method, named MT-Path, which leverages the temporal information to traverse historical n-tuples and construct a temporal reasoning path. Specifically, in order to integrate the information encapsulated within n-tuples, i.e., the entity-irrelevant information within the predicate, the information about core elements, and the complete information about the entire n-tuples, MT-Path utilizes a mixture policy-driven action selector, which bases on three low-level policies, namely, the predicate-focused policy, the core-element-focused policy and the whole-fact-focused policy. Further, MT-Path utilizes an auxiliary element-aware GCN to capture the rich semantic dependencies among facts, thereby enabling the agent to gain a deep understanding of each n-tuple. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and the explainability of MT-Path.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12788v1
Search-Based Correction of Reasoning Chains for Language Models,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has advanced the capabilities and transparency of language models (LMs); however, reasoning chains can contain inaccurate statements that reduce performance and trustworthiness. To address this, we introduce a new self-correction framework that augments each reasoning step in a CoT with a latent variable indicating its veracity, enabling modeling of all possible truth assignments rather than assuming correctness throughout. To efficiently explore this expanded space, we introduce Search Corrector, a discrete search algorithm over boolean-valued veracity assignments. It efficiently performs otherwise intractable inference in the posterior distribution over veracity assignments by leveraging the LM's joint likelihood over veracity and the final answer as a proxy reward. This efficient inference-time correction method facilitates supervised fine-tuning of an Amortized Corrector by providing pseudo-labels for veracity. The Amortized Corrector generalizes self-correction, enabling accurate zero-shot veracity inference in novel contexts. Empirical results demonstrate that Search Corrector reliably identifies errors in logical (ProntoQA) and mathematical reasoning (GSM8K) benchmarks. The Amortized Corrector achieves comparable zero-shot accuracy and improves final answer accuracy by up to 25%.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11824v1
SGD-Mix: Enhancing Domain-Specific Image Classification with   Label-Preserving Data Augmentation,"Data augmentation for domain-specific image classification tasks often struggles to simultaneously address diversity, faithfulness, and label clarity of generated data, leading to suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. While existing generative diffusion model-based methods aim to enhance augmentation, they fail to cohesively tackle these three critical aspects and often overlook intrinsic challenges of diffusion models, such as sensitivity to model characteristics and stochasticity under strong transformations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that explicitly integrates diversity, faithfulness, and label clarity into the augmentation process. Our approach employs saliency-guided mixing and a fine-tuned diffusion model to preserve foreground semantics, enrich background diversity, and ensure label consistency, while mitigating diffusion model limitations. Extensive experiments across fine-grained, long-tail, few-shot, and background robustness tasks demonstrate our method's superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11813v1
Imagination-Limited Q-Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning,"Offline reinforcement learning seeks to derive improved policies entirely from historical data but often struggles with over-optimistic value estimates for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. This issue is typically mitigated via policy constraint or conservative value regularization methods. However, these approaches may impose overly constraints or biased value estimates, potentially limiting performance improvements. To balance exploitation and restriction, we propose an Imagination-Limited Q-learning (ILQ) method, which aims to maintain the optimism that OOD actions deserve within appropriate limits. Specifically, we utilize the dynamics model to imagine OOD action-values, and then clip the imagined values with the maximum behavior values. Such design maintains reasonable evaluation of OOD actions to the furthest extent, while avoiding its over-optimism. Theoretically, we prove the convergence of the proposed ILQ under tabular Markov decision processes. Particularly, we demonstrate that the error bound between estimated values and optimality values of OOD state-actions possesses the same magnitude as that of in-distribution ones, thereby indicating that the bias in value estimates is effectively mitigated. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks in the D4RL benchmark.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12211v1
Fully Geometric Multi-Hop Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs with Transitive   Relations,"Geometric embedding methods have shown to be useful for multi-hop reasoning on knowledge graphs by mapping entities and logical operations to geometric regions and geometric transformations, respectively. Geometric embeddings provide direct interpretability framework for queries. However, current methods have only leveraged the geometric construction of entities, failing to map logical operations to geometric transformations and, instead, using neural components to learn these operations. We introduce GeometrE, a geometric embedding method for multi-hop reasoning, which does not require learning the logical operations and enables full geometric interpretability. Additionally, unlike previous methods, we introduce a transitive loss function and show that it can preserve the logical rule $\forall a,b,c: r(a,b) \land r(b,c) \to r(a,c)$. Our experiments show that GeometrE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12369v1
Efficient Uncertainty Estimation via Distillation of Bayesian Large   Language Models,"Recent advances in uncertainty estimation for Large Language Models (LLMs) during downstream adaptation have addressed key challenges of reliability and simplicity. However, existing Bayesian methods typically require multiple sampling iterations during inference, creating significant efficiency issues that limit practical deployment. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of eliminating the need for test-time sampling for LLM uncertainty estimation. Specifically, when given an off-the-shelf Bayesian LLM, we distill its aligned confidence into a non-Bayesian student LLM by minimizing the divergence between their predictive distributions. Unlike typical calibration methods, our distillation is carried out solely on the training dataset without the need of an additional validation dataset. This simple yet effective approach achieves N-times more efficient uncertainty estimation during testing, where N is the number of samples traditionally required by Bayesian LLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that uncertainty estimation capabilities on training data can successfully generalize to unseen test data through our distillation technique, consistently producing results comparable to (or even better than) state-of-the-art Bayesian LLMs.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11731v1
Advancing Sequential Numerical Prediction in Autoregressive Models,"Autoregressive models have become the de facto choice for sequence generation tasks, but standard approaches treat digits as independent tokens and apply cross-entropy loss, overlooking the coherent structure of numerical sequences. This paper introduces Numerical Token Integrity Loss (NTIL) to address this gap. NTIL operates at two levels: (1) token-level, where it extends the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to preserve ordinal relationships between numerical values, and (2) sequence-level, where it penalizes the overall discrepancy between the predicted and actual sequences. This dual approach improves numerical prediction and integrates effectively with LLMs/MLLMs. Extensive experiments show significant performance improvements with NTIL.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13077v1
VFRTok: Variable Frame Rates Video Tokenizer with Duration-Proportional   Information Assumption,"Modern video generation frameworks based on Latent Diffusion Models suffer from inefficiencies in tokenization due to the Frame-Proportional Information Assumption. Existing tokenizers provide fixed temporal compression rates, causing the computational cost of the diffusion model to scale linearly with the frame rate. The paper proposes the Duration-Proportional Information Assumption: the upper bound on the information capacity of a video is proportional to the duration rather than the number of frames. Based on this insight, the paper introduces VFRTok, a Transformer-based video tokenizer, that enables variable frame rate encoding and decoding through asymmetric frame rate training between the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, the paper proposes Partial Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to decouple position and content modeling, which groups correlated patches into unified tokens. The Partial RoPE effectively improves content-awareness, enhancing the video generation capability. Benefiting from the compact and continuous spatio-temporal representation, VFRTok achieves competitive reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art generation fidelity while using only 1/8 tokens compared to existing tokenizers.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12053v1
On the Eligibility of LLMs for Counterfactual Reasoning: A   Decompositional Study,"Counterfactual reasoning has emerged as a crucial technique for generalizing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). By generating and analyzing counterfactual scenarios, researchers can assess the adaptability and reliability of model decision-making. Although prior work has shown that LLMs often struggle with counterfactual reasoning, it remains unclear which factors most significantly impede their performance across different tasks and modalities. In this paper, we propose a decompositional strategy that breaks down the counterfactual generation from causality construction to the reasoning over counterfactual interventions. To support decompositional analysis, we investigate 11 datasets spanning diverse tasks, including natural language understanding, mathematics, programming, and vision-language tasks. Through extensive evaluations, we characterize LLM behavior across each decompositional stage and identify how modality type and intermediate reasoning influence performance. By establishing a structured framework for analyzing counterfactual reasoning, this work contributes to the development of more reliable LLM-based reasoning systems and informs future elicitation strategies.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11839v1
Seek in the Dark: Reasoning via Test-Time Instance-Level Policy Gradient   in Latent Space,"Reasoning ability, a core component of human intelligence, continues to pose a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) in the pursuit of AGI. Although model performance has improved under the training scaling law, significant challenges remain, particularly with respect to training algorithms, such as catastrophic forgetting, and the limited availability of novel training data. As an alternative, test-time scaling enhances reasoning performance by increasing test-time computation without parameter updating. Unlike prior methods in this paradigm focused on token space, we propose leveraging latent space for more effective reasoning and better adherence to the test-time scaling law. We introduce LatentSeek, a novel framework that enhances LLM reasoning through Test-Time Instance-level Adaptation (TTIA) within the model's latent space. Specifically, LatentSeek leverages policy gradient to iteratively update latent representations, guided by self-generated reward signals. LatentSeek is evaluated on a range of reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME2024, across multiple LLM architectures. Results show that LatentSeek consistently outperforms strong baselines, such as Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning-based methods. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that LatentSeek is highly efficient, typically converging within a few iterations for problems of average complexity, while also benefiting from additional iterations, thereby highlighting the potential of test-time scaling in the latent space. These findings position LatentSeek as a lightweight, scalable, and effective solution for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13308v1
Tianyi: A Traditional Chinese Medicine all-rounder language model and   its Real-World Clinical Practice,"Natural medicines, particularly Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), are gaining global recognition for their therapeutic potential in addressing human symptoms and diseases. TCM, with its systematic theories and extensive practical experience, provides abundant resources for healthcare. However, the effective application of TCM requires precise syndrome diagnosis, determination of treatment principles, and prescription formulation, which demand decades of clinical expertise. Despite advancements in TCM-based decision systems, machine learning, and deep learning research, limitations in data and single-objective constraints hinder their practical application. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in complex tasks, but lack specialization in TCM and face significant challenges, such as too big model scale to deploy and issues with hallucination. To address these challenges, we introduce Tianyi with 7.6-billion-parameter LLM, a model scale proper and specifically designed for TCM, pre-trained and fine-tuned on diverse TCM corpora, including classical texts, expert treatises, clinical records, and knowledge graphs. Tianyi is designed to assimilate interconnected and systematic TCM knowledge through a progressive learning manner. Additionally, we establish TCMEval, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, to assess LLMs in TCM examinations, clinical tasks, domain-specific question-answering, and real-world trials. The extensive evaluations demonstrate the significant potential of Tianyi as an AI assistant in TCM clinical practice and research, bridging the gap between TCM knowledge and practical application.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13156v1
Unveiling and Steering Connectome Organization with Interpretable Latent   Variables,"The brain's intricate connectome, a blueprint for its function, presents immense complexity, yet it arises from a compact genetic code, hinting at underlying low-dimensional organizational principles. This work bridges connectomics and representation learning to uncover these principles. We propose a framework that combines subgraph extraction from the Drosophila connectome, FlyWire, with a generative model to derive interpretable low-dimensional representations of neural circuitry. Crucially, an explainability module links these latent dimensions to specific structural features, offering insights into their functional relevance. We validate our approach by demonstrating effective graph reconstruction and, significantly, the ability to manipulate these latent codes to controllably generate connectome subgraphs with predefined properties. This research offers a novel tool for understanding brain architecture and a potential avenue for designing bio-inspired artificial neural networks.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13011v1
A universal policy wrapper with guarantees,"We introduce a universal policy wrapper for reinforcement learning agents that ensures formal goal-reaching guarantees. In contrast to standard reinforcement learning algorithms that excel in performance but lack rigorous safety assurances, our wrapper selectively switches between a high-performing base policy -- derived from any existing RL method -- and a fallback policy with known convergence properties. Base policy's value function supervises this switching process, determining when the fallback policy should override the base policy to ensure the system remains on a stable path. The analysis proves that our wrapper inherits the fallback policy's goal-reaching guarantees while preserving or improving upon the performance of the base policy. Notably, it operates without needing additional system knowledge or online constrained optimization, making it readily deployable across diverse reinforcement learning architectures and tasks.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12354v1
Interactional Fairness in LLM Multi-Agent Systems: An Evaluation   Framework,"As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in multi-agent systems, questions of fairness should extend beyond resource distribution and procedural design to include the fairness of how agents communicate. Drawing from organizational psychology, we introduce a novel framework for evaluating Interactional fairness encompassing Interpersonal fairness (IF) and Informational fairness (InfF) in LLM-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS). We extend the theoretical grounding of Interactional Fairness to non-sentient agents, reframing fairness as a socially interpretable signal rather than a subjective experience. We then adapt established tools from organizational justice research, including Colquitt's Organizational Justice Scale and the Critical Incident Technique, to measure fairness as a behavioral property of agent interaction. We validate our framework through a pilot study using controlled simulations of a resource negotiation task. We systematically manipulate tone, explanation quality, outcome inequality, and task framing (collaborative vs. competitive) to assess how IF influences agent behavior. Results show that tone and justification quality significantly affect acceptance decisions even when objective outcomes are held constant. In addition, the influence of IF vs. InfF varies with context. This work lays the foundation for fairness auditing and norm-sensitive alignment in LLM-MAS.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12001v1
Conversational Recommendation System using NLP and Sentiment Analysis,"In today's digitally-driven world, the demand for personalized and context-aware recommendations has never been greater. Traditional recommender systems have made significant strides in this direction, but they often lack the ability to tap into the richness of conversational data. This paper represents a novel approach to recommendation systems by integrating conversational insights into the recommendation process. The Conversational Recommender System integrates cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning, leveraging machine learning algorithms like Apriori for Association Rule Mining, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM). Furthermore, sophisticated voice recognition technologies, including Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms, play a crucial role in accurate speech-to-text conversion, ensuring robust performance in diverse environments. The methodology incorporates a fusion of content-based and collaborative recommendation approaches, enhancing them with NLP techniques. This innovative integration ensures a more personalized and context-aware recommendation experience, particularly in marketing applications.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11933v1
LEXam: Benchmarking Legal Reasoning on 340 Law Exams,"Long-form legal reasoning remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs) in spite of recent advances in test-time scaling. We introduce LEXam, a novel benchmark derived from 340 law exams spanning 116 law school courses across a range of subjects and degree levels. The dataset comprises 4,886 law exam questions in English and German, including 2,841 long-form, open-ended questions and 2,045 multiple-choice questions. Besides reference answers, the open questions are also accompanied by explicit guidance outlining the expected legal reasoning approach such as issue spotting, rule recall, or rule application. Our evaluation on both open-ended and multiple-choice questions present significant challenges for current LLMs; in particular, they notably struggle with open questions that require structured, multi-step legal reasoning. Moreover, our results underscore the effectiveness of the dataset in differentiating between models with varying capabilities. Adopting an LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with rigorous human expert validation, we demonstrate how model-generated reasoning steps can be evaluated consistently and accurately. Our evaluation setup provides a scalable method to assess legal reasoning quality beyond simple accuracy metrics.

EarthSynth: Generating Informative Earth Observation with Diffusion   Models,"Remote sensing image (RSI) interpretation typically faces challenges due to the scarcity of labeled data, which limits the performance of RSI interpretation tasks. To tackle this challenge, we propose EarthSynth, a diffusion-based generative foundation model that enables synthesizing multi-category, cross-satellite labeled Earth observation for downstream RSI interpretation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, EarthSynth is the first to explore multi-task generation for remote sensing. EarthSynth, trained on the EarthSynth-180K dataset, employs the Counterfactual Composition training strategy to improve training data diversity and enhance category control. Furthermore, a rule-based method of R-Filter is proposed to filter more informative synthetic data for downstream tasks. We evaluate our EarthSynth on scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation in open-world scenarios, offering a practical solution for advancing RSI interpretation.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12108v1
Vague Knowledge: Evidence from Analyst Reports,"People in the real world often possess vague knowledge of future payoffs, for which quantification is not feasible or desirable. We argue that language, with differing ability to convey vague information, plays an important but less known-role in subjective expectations. Empirically, we find that in their reports, analysts include useful information in linguistic expressions but not numerical forecasts. Specifically, the textual tone of analyst reports has predictive power for forecast errors and subsequent revisions in numerical forecasts, and this relation becomes stronger when analyst's language is vaguer, when uncertainty is higher, and when analysts are busier. Overall, our theory and evidence suggest that some useful information is vaguely known and only communicated through language.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12269v1
Zero-Shot Iterative Formalization and Planning in Partially Observable   Environments,"In planning, using LLMs not to predict plans but to formalize an environment into the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) has been shown to greatly improve performance and control. While most work focused on fully observable environments, we tackle the more realistic and challenging partially observable environments where existing methods are incapacitated by the lack of complete information. We propose PDDLego+, a framework to iteratively formalize, plan, grow, and refine PDDL representations in a zero-shot manner, without needing access to any existing trajectories. On two textual simulated environments, we show that PDDLego+ not only achieves superior performance, but also shows robustness against problem complexity. We also show that the domain knowledge captured after a successful trial is interpretable and benefits future tasks.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13126v1
PsyMem: Fine-grained psychological alignment and Explicit Memory Control   for Advanced Role-Playing LLMs,"Existing LLM-based role-playing methods often rely on superficial textual descriptions or simplistic metrics, inadequately modeling both intrinsic and extrinsic character dimensions. Additionally, they typically simulate character memory with implicit model knowledge or basic retrieval augment generation without explicit memory alignment, compromising memory consistency. The two issues weaken reliability of role-playing LLMs in several applications, such as trustworthy social simulation. To address these limitations, we propose PsyMem, a novel framework integrating fine-grained psychological attributes and explicit memory control for role-playing. PsyMem supplements textual descriptions with 26 psychological indicators to detailed model character. Additionally, PsyMem implements memory alignment training, explicitly trains the model to align character's response with memory, thereby enabling dynamic memory-controlled responding during inference. By training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on our specially designed dataset (including 5,414 characters and 38,962 dialogues extracted from novels), the resulting model, termed as PsyMem-Qwen, outperforms baseline models in role-playing, achieving the best performance in human-likeness and character fidelity.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12814v1
Decoding the Mind of Large Language Models: A Quantitative Evaluation of   Ideology and Biases,"The widespread integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various sectors has highlighted the need for empirical research to understand their biases, thought patterns, and societal implications to ensure ethical and effective use. In this study, we propose a novel framework for evaluating LLMs, focusing on uncovering their ideological biases through a quantitative analysis of 436 binary-choice questions, many of which have no definitive answer. By applying our framework to ChatGPT and Gemini, findings revealed that while LLMs generally maintain consistent opinions on many topics, their ideologies differ across models and languages. Notably, ChatGPT exhibits a tendency to change their opinion to match the questioner's opinion. Both models also exhibited problematic biases, unethical or unfair claims, which might have negative societal impacts. These results underscore the importance of addressing both ideological and ethical considerations when evaluating LLMs. The proposed framework offers a flexible, quantitative method for assessing LLM behavior, providing valuable insights for the development of more socially aligned AI systems.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12183v1
Multi-Armed Bandits Meet Large Language Models,"Bandit algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in artificial intelligence, each addressing distinct yet complementary challenges in decision-making and natural language processing. This survey explores the synergistic potential between these two fields, highlighting how bandit algorithms can enhance the performance of LLMs and how LLMs, in turn, can provide novel insights for improving bandit-based decision-making. We first examine the role of bandit algorithms in optimizing LLM fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and adaptive response generation, focusing on their ability to balance exploration and exploitation in large-scale learning tasks. Subsequently, we explore how LLMs can augment bandit algorithms through advanced contextual understanding, dynamic adaptation, and improved policy selection using natural language reasoning. By providing a comprehensive review of existing research and identifying key challenges and opportunities, this survey aims to bridge the gap between bandit algorithms and LLMs, paving the way for innovative applications and interdisciplinary research in AI.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13355v1
VeriReason: Reinforcement Learning with Testbench Feedback for   Reasoning-Enhanced Verilog Generation,"Automating Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) offers substantial promise for streamlining digital circuit design and reducing human effort. However, current LLM-based approaches face significant challenges with training data scarcity, poor specification-code alignment, lack of verification mechanisms, and balancing generalization with specialization. Inspired by DeepSeek-R1, we introduce VeriReason, a framework integrating supervised fine-tuning with Guided Reward Proximal Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning for RTL generation. Using curated training examples and a feedback-driven reward model, VeriReason combines testbench evaluations with structural heuristics while embedding self-checking capabilities for autonomous error correction. On the VerilogEval Benchmark, VeriReason delivers significant improvements: achieving 83.1% functional correctness on the VerilogEval Machine benchmark, substantially outperforming both comparable-sized models and much larger commercial systems like GPT-4 Turbo. Additionally, our approach demonstrates up to a 2.8X increase in first-attempt functional correctness compared to baseline methods and exhibits robust generalization to unseen designs. To our knowledge, VeriReason represents the first system to successfully integrate explicit reasoning capabilities with reinforcement learning for Verilog generation, establishing a new state-of-the-art for automated RTL synthesis. The models and datasets are available at: https://huggingface.co/collections/AI4EDA-CASE Code is Available at: https://github.com/NellyW8/VeriReason",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11849v1
MRGRP: Empowering Courier Route Prediction in Food Delivery Service with   Multi-Relational Graph,"Instant food delivery has become one of the most popular web services worldwide due to its convenience in daily life. A fundamental challenge is accurately predicting courier routes to optimize task dispatch and improve delivery efficiency. This enhances satisfaction for couriers and users and increases platform profitability. The current heuristic prediction method uses only limited human-selected task features and ignores couriers preferences, causing suboptimal results. Additionally, existing learning-based methods do not fully capture the diverse factors influencing courier decisions or the complex relationships among them. To address this, we propose a Multi-Relational Graph-based Route Prediction (MRGRP) method that models fine-grained correlations among tasks affecting courier decisions for accurate prediction. We encode spatial and temporal proximity, along with pickup-delivery relationships, into a multi-relational graph and design a GraphFormer architecture to capture these complex connections. We also introduce a route decoder that leverages courier information and dynamic distance and time contexts for prediction, using existing route solutions as references to improve outcomes. Experiments show our model achieves state-of-the-art route prediction on offline data from cities of various sizes. Deployed on the Meituan Turing platform, it surpasses the current heuristic algorithm, reaching a high route prediction accuracy of 0.819, essential for courier and user satisfaction in instant food delivery.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11999v1
VTBench: Evaluating Visual Tokenizers for Autoregressive Image   Generation,"Autoregressive (AR) models have recently shown strong performance in image generation, where a critical component is the visual tokenizer (VT) that maps continuous pixel inputs to discrete token sequences. The quality of the VT largely defines the upper bound of AR model performance. However, current discrete VTs fall significantly behind continuous variational autoencoders (VAEs), leading to degraded image reconstructions and poor preservation of details and text. Existing benchmarks focus on end-to-end generation quality, without isolating VT performance. To address this gap, we introduce VTBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates VTs across three core tasks: Image Reconstruction, Detail Preservation, and Text Preservation, and covers a diverse range of evaluation scenarios. We systematically assess state-of-the-art VTs using a set of metrics to evaluate the quality of reconstructed images. Our findings reveal that continuous VAEs produce superior visual representations compared to discrete VTs, particularly in retaining spatial structure and semantic detail. In contrast, the degraded representations produced by discrete VTs often lead to distorted reconstructions, loss of fine-grained textures, and failures in preserving text and object integrity. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on GPT-4o image generation and discuss its potential AR nature, offering new insights into the role of visual tokenization. We release our benchmark and codebase publicly to support further research and call on the community to develop strong, general-purpose open-source VTs.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13439v1
AD-AGENT: A Multi-agent Framework for End-to-end Anomaly Detection,"Anomaly detection (AD) is essential in areas such as fraud detection, network monitoring, and scientific research. However, the diversity of data modalities and the increasing number of specialized AD libraries pose challenges for non-expert users who lack in-depth library-specific knowledge and advanced programming skills. To tackle this, we present AD-AGENT, an LLM-driven multi-agent framework that turns natural-language instructions into fully executable AD pipelines. AD-AGENT coordinates specialized agents for intent parsing, data preparation, library and model selection, documentation mining, and iterative code generation and debugging. Using a shared short-term workspace and a long-term cache, the agents integrate popular AD libraries like PyOD, PyGOD, and TSLib into a unified workflow. Experiments demonstrate that AD-AGENT produces reliable scripts and recommends competitive models across libraries. The system is open-sourced to support further research and practical applications in AD.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12594v1
Scalable Strategies for Continual Learning with Replay,"Future deep learning models will be distinguished by systems that perpetually learn through interaction, imagination, and cooperation, blurring the line between training and inference. This makes continual learning a critical challenge, as methods that efficiently maximize bidirectional transfer across learning trajectories will be essential. Replay is on track to play a foundational role in continual learning, allowing models to directly reconcile new information with past knowledge. In practice, however, replay is quite unscalable, doubling the cost of continual learning when applied naively. Moreover, the continual learning literature has not fully synchronized with the multi-task fine-tuning literature, having not fully integrated highly scalable techniques like model merging and low rank adaptation into a replay-enabled toolset that can produce a unified model in the face of many sequential tasks. In this paper, we begin by applying and analyzing low rank adaptation in a continual learning setting. Next, we introduce consolidation, a phasic approach to replay which leads to up to 55\% less replay samples being needed for a given performance target. Then, we propose sequential merging, an offshoot of task arithmetic which is tailored to the continual learning setting and is shown to work well in combination with replay. Finally, we demonstrate that the developed strategies can operate synergistically, resulting in a highly scalable toolset that outperforms standalone variants.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12512v1
Neural Networks as Universal Finite-State Machines: A Constructive   Deterministic Finite Automaton Theory,"We present a complete theoretical and empirical framework establishing feedforward neural networks as universal finite-state machines (N-FSMs). Our results prove that finite-depth ReLU and threshold networks can exactly simulate deterministic finite automata (DFAs) by unrolling state transitions into depth-wise neural layers, with formal characterizations of required depth, width, and state compression. We demonstrate that DFA transitions are linearly separable, binary threshold activations allow exponential compression, and Myhill-Nerode equivalence classes can be embedded into continuous latent spaces while preserving separability. We also formalize the expressivity boundary: fixed-depth feedforward networks cannot recognize non-regular languages requiring unbounded memory. Unlike prior heuristic or probing-based studies, we provide constructive proofs and design explicit DFA-unrolled neural architectures that empirically validate every claim. Our results bridge deep learning, automata theory, and neural-symbolic computation, offering a rigorous blueprint for how discrete symbolic processes can be realized in continuous neural systems.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11694v1
LLM-KG-Bench 3.0: A Compass for SemanticTechnology Capabilities in the   Ocean of LLMs,"Current Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist developing program code beside many other things, but can they support working with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) as well? Which LLM is offering the best capabilities in the field of Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph Engineering (KGE)? Is this possible to determine without checking many answers manually? The LLM-KG-Bench framework in Version 3.0 is designed to answer these questions. It consists of an extensible set of tasks for automated evaluation of LLM answers and covers different aspects of working with semantic technologies. In this paper the LLM-KG-Bench framework is presented in Version 3 along with a dataset of prompts, answers and evaluations generated with it and several state-of-the-art LLMs. Significant enhancements have been made to the framework since its initial release, including an updated task API that offers greater flexibility in handling evaluation tasks, revised tasks, and extended support for various open models through the vllm library, among other improvements. A comprehensive dataset has been generated using more than 30 contemporary open and proprietary LLMs, enabling the creation of exemplary model cards that demonstrate the models' capabilities in working with RDF and SPARQL, as well as comparing their performance on Turtle and JSON-LD RDF serialization tasks.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13098v1
PhyDA: Physics-Guided Diffusion Models for Data Assimilation in   Atmospheric Systems,"Data Assimilation (DA) plays a critical role in atmospheric science by reconstructing spatially continous estimates of the system state, which serves as initial conditions for scientific analysis. While recent advances in diffusion models have shown great potential for DA tasks, most existing approaches remain purely data-driven and often overlook the physical laws that govern complex atmospheric dynamics. As a result, they may yield physically inconsistent reconstructions that impair downstream applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose PhyDA, a physics-guided diffusion framework designed to ensure physical coherence in atmospheric data assimilation. PhyDA introduces two key components: (1) a Physically Regularized Diffusion Objective that integrates physical constraints into the training process by penalizing deviations from known physical laws expressed as partial differential equations, and (2) a Virtual Reconstruction Encoder that bridges observational sparsity for structured latent representations, further enhancing the model's ability to infer complete and physically coherent states. Experiments on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset demonstrate that PhyDA achieves superior accuracy and better physical plausibility compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our results emphasize the importance of combining generative modeling with domain-specific physical knowledge and show that PhyDA offers a promising direction for improving real-world data assimilation systems.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12882v1
Enhancing LLMs for Time Series Forecasting via Structure-Guided   Cross-Modal Alignment,"The emerging paradigm of leveraging pretrained large language models (LLMs) for time series forecasting has predominantly employed linguistic-temporal modality alignment strategies through token-level or layer-wise feature mapping. However, these approaches fundamentally neglect a critical insight: the core competency of LLMs resides not merely in processing localized token features but in their inherent capacity to model holistic sequence structures. This paper posits that effective cross-modal alignment necessitates structural consistency at the sequence level. We propose the Structure-Guided Cross-Modal Alignment (SGCMA), a framework that fully exploits and aligns the state-transition graph structures shared by time-series and linguistic data as sequential modalities, thereby endowing time series with language-like properties and delivering stronger generalization after modality alignment. SGCMA consists of two key components, namely Structure Alignment and Semantic Alignment. In Structure Alignment, a state transition matrix is learned from text data through Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and a shallow transformer-based Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM) receives the hot-start transition matrix and annotates each temporal patch into state probability, ensuring that the temporal representation sequence inherits language-like sequential dynamics. In Semantic Alignment, cross-attention is applied between temporal patches and the top-k tokens within each state, and the ultimate temporal embeddings are derived by the expected value of these embeddings using a weighted average based on state probabilities. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SGCMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a novel approach to cross-modal alignment in time series forecasting.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13175v1
CAPTURE: Context-Aware Prompt Injection Testing and Robustness   Enhancement,"Prompt injection remains a major security risk for large language models. However, the efficacy of existing guardrail models in context-aware settings remains underexplored, as they often rely on static attack benchmarks. Additionally, they have over-defense tendencies. We introduce CAPTURE, a novel context-aware benchmark assessing both attack detection and over-defense tendencies with minimal in-domain examples. Our experiments reveal that current prompt injection guardrail models suffer from high false negatives in adversarial cases and excessive false positives in benign scenarios, highlighting critical limitations.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12368v1
LightRetriever: A LLM-based Hybrid Retrieval Architecture with 1000x   Faster Query Inference,"Large Language Models (LLMs)-based hybrid retrieval uses LLMs to encode queries and documents into low-dimensional dense or high-dimensional sparse vectors. It retrieves documents relevant to search queries based on vector similarities. Documents are pre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in real-time, necessitating an efficient online query encoder. Although LLMs significantly enhance retrieval capabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs slows down query inference throughput and increases demands for online deployment resources. In this paper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel LLM-based hybrid retriever with extremely lightweight query encoders. Our method retains a full-sized LLM for document encoding, but reduces the workload of query encoding to no more than an embedding lookup. Compared to serving a full-sized LLM on an H800 GPU, our approach achieves over a 1000x speedup for query inference with GPU acceleration, and even a 20x speedup without GPU. Experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method generalizes well across diverse retrieval tasks, retaining an average of 95% full-sized performance.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12260v1
Automated Real-time Assessment of Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection AI   Using an Ensembled Monitoring Model (EMM),"Artificial intelligence (AI) tools for radiology are commonly unmonitored once deployed. The lack of real-time case-by-case assessments of AI prediction confidence requires users to independently distinguish between trustworthy and unreliable AI predictions, which increases cognitive burden, reduces productivity, and potentially leads to misdiagnoses. To address these challenges, we introduce Ensembled Monitoring Model (EMM), a framework inspired by clinical consensus practices using multiple expert reviews. Designed specifically for black-box commercial AI products, EMM operates independently without requiring access to internal AI components or intermediate outputs, while still providing robust confidence measurements. Using intracranial hemorrhage detection as our test case on a large, diverse dataset of 2919 studies, we demonstrate that EMM successfully categorizes confidence in the AI-generated prediction, suggesting different actions and helping improve the overall performance of AI tools to ultimately reduce cognitive burden. Importantly, we provide key technical considerations and best practices for successfully translating EMM into clinical settings.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11738v1
DNOI-4DRO: Deep 4D Radar Odometry with Differentiable   Neural-Optimization Iterations,"A novel learning-optimization-combined 4D radar odometry model, named DNOI-4DRO, is proposed in this paper. The proposed model seamlessly integrates traditional geometric optimization with end-to-end neural network training, leveraging an innovative differentiable neural-optimization iteration operator. In this framework, point-wise motion flow is first estimated using a neural network, followed by the construction of a cost function based on the relationship between point motion and pose in 3D space. The radar pose is then refined using Gauss-Newton updates. Additionally, we design a dual-stream 4D radar backbone that integrates multi-scale geometric features and clustering-based class-aware features to enhance the representation of sparse 4D radar point clouds. Extensive experiments on the VoD and Snail-Radar datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model, which outperforms recent classical and learning-based approaches. Notably, our method even achieves results comparable to A-LOAM with mapping optimization using LiDAR point clouds as input. Our models and code will be publicly released.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12310v1
Scaling Computer-Use Grounding via User Interface Decomposition and   Synthesis,"Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding, the ability to map natural language instructions to specific actions on graphical user interfaces, remains a critical bottleneck in computer use agent development. Current benchmarks oversimplify grounding tasks as short referring expressions, failing to capture the complexity of real-world interactions that require software commonsense, layout understanding, and fine-grained manipulation capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce OSWorld-G, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 564 finely annotated samples across diverse task types including text matching, element recognition, layout understanding, and precise manipulation. Additionally, we synthesize and release the largest computer use grounding dataset Jedi, which contains 4 million examples through multi-perspective decoupling of tasks. Our multi-scale models trained on Jedi demonstrate its effectiveness by outperforming existing approaches on ScreenSpot-v2, ScreenSpot-Pro, and our OSWorld-G. Furthermore, we demonstrate that improved grounding with Jedi directly enhances agentic capabilities of general foundation models on complex computer tasks, improving from 5% to 27% on OSWorld. Through detailed ablation studies, we identify key factors contributing to grounding performance and verify that combining specialized data for different interface elements enables compositional generalization to novel interfaces. All benchmark, data, checkpoints, and code are open-sourced and available at https://osworld-grounding.github.io.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13227v1
AutoMathKG: The automated mathematical knowledge graph based on LLM and   vector database,"A mathematical knowledge graph (KG) presents knowledge within the field of mathematics in a structured manner. Constructing a math KG using natural language is an essential but challenging task. There are two major limitations of existing works: first, they are constrained by corpus completeness, often discarding or manually supplementing incomplete knowledge; second, they typically fail to fully automate the integration of diverse knowledge sources. This paper proposes AutoMathKG, a high-quality, wide-coverage, and multi-dimensional math KG capable of automatic updates. AutoMathKG regards mathematics as a vast directed graph composed of Definition, Theorem, and Problem entities, with their reference relationships as edges. It integrates knowledge from ProofWiki, textbooks, arXiv papers, and TheoremQA, enhancing entities and relationships with large language models (LLMs) via in-context learning for data augmentation. To search for similar entities, MathVD, a vector database, is built through two designed embedding strategies using SBERT. To automatically update, two mechanisms are proposed. For knowledge completion mechanism, Math LLM is developed to interact with AutoMathKG, providing missing proofs or solutions. For knowledge fusion mechanism, MathVD is used to retrieve similar entities, and LLM is used to determine whether to merge with a candidate or add as a new entity. A wide range of experiments demonstrate the advanced performance and broad applicability of the AutoMathKG system, including superior reachability query results in MathVD compared to five baselines and robust mathematical reasoning capability in Math LLM.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13406v1
LAMeTA: Intent-Aware Agentic Network Optimization via a Large AI   Model-Empowered Two-Stage Approach,"Nowadays, Generative AI (GenAI) reshapes numerous domains by enabling machines to create content across modalities. As GenAI evolves into autonomous agents capable of reasoning, collaboration, and interaction, they are increasingly deployed on network infrastructures to serve humans automatically. This emerging paradigm, known as the agentic network, presents new optimization challenges due to the demand to incorporate subjective intents of human users expressed in natural language. Traditional generic Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) struggles to capture intent semantics and adjust policies dynamically, thus leading to suboptimality. In this paper, we present LAMeTA, a Large AI Model (LAM)-empowered Two-stage Approach for intent-aware agentic network optimization. First, we propose Intent-oriented Knowledge Distillation (IoKD), which efficiently distills intent-understanding capabilities from resource-intensive LAMs to lightweight edge LAMs (E-LAMs) to serve end users. Second, we develop Symbiotic Reinforcement Learning (SRL), integrating E-LAMs with a policy-based DRL framework. In SRL, E-LAMs translate natural language user intents into structured preference vectors that guide both state representation and reward design. The DRL, in turn, optimizes the generative service function chain composition and E-LAM selection based on real-time network conditions, thus optimizing the subjective Quality-of-Experience (QoE). Extensive experiments conducted in an agentic network with 81 agents demonstrate that IoKD reduces mean squared error in intent prediction by up to 22.5%, while SRL outperforms conventional generic DRL by up to 23.5% in maximizing intent-aware QoE.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12247v1
AbFlowNet: Optimizing Antibody-Antigen Binding Energy via   Diffusion-GFlowNet Fusion,"Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are critical segments of an antibody that facilitate binding to specific antigens. Current computational methods for CDR design utilize reconstruction losses and do not jointly optimize binding energy, a crucial metric for antibody efficacy. Rather, binding energy optimization is done through computationally expensive Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipelines rely heavily on unreliable binding energy estimators. In this paper, we propose AbFlowNet, a novel generative framework that integrates GFlowNet with Diffusion models. By framing each diffusion step as a state in the GFlowNet framework, AbFlowNet jointly optimizes standard diffusion losses and binding energy by directly incorporating energy signals into the training process, thereby unifying diffusion and reward optimization in a single procedure. Experimental results show that AbFlowNet outperforms the base diffusion model by 3.06% in amino acid recovery, 20.40% in geometric reconstruction (RMSD), and 3.60% in binding energy improvement ratio. ABFlowNet also decreases Top-1 total energy and binding energy errors by 24.8% and 38.1% without pseudo-labeling the test dataset or using computationally expensive online RL regimes.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12358v1
ARC-AGI-2: A New Challenge for Frontier AI Reasoning Systems,"The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI), introduced in 2019, established a challenging benchmark for evaluating the general fluid intelligence of artificial systems via a set of unique, novel tasks only requiring minimal prior knowledge. While ARC-AGI has spurred significant research activity over the past five years, recent AI progress calls for benchmarks capable of finer-grained evaluation at higher levels of cognitive complexity. We introduce ARC-AGI-2, an upgraded version of the benchmark. ARC-AGI-2 preserves the input-output pair task format of its predecessor, ensuring continuity for researchers. It incorporates a newly curated and expanded set of tasks specifically designed to provide a more granular signal to assess abstract reasoning and problem-solving abilities at higher levels of fluid intelligence. To contextualize the difficulty and characteristics of ARC-AGI-2, we present extensive results from human testing, providing a robust baseline that highlights the benchmark's accessibility to human intelligence, yet difficulty for current AI systems. ARC-AGI-2 aims to serve as a next-generation tool for rigorously measuring progress towards more general and human-like AI capabilities.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11831v1
PoLO: Proof-of-Learning and Proof-of-Ownership at Once with Chained   Watermarking,"Machine learning models are increasingly shared and outsourced, raising requirements of verifying training effort (Proof-of-Learning, PoL) to ensure claimed performance and establishing ownership (Proof-of-Ownership, PoO) for transactions. When models are trained by untrusted parties, PoL and PoO must be enforced together to enable protection, attribution, and compensation. However, existing studies typically address them separately, which not only weakens protection against forgery and privacy breaches but also leads to high verification overhead.   We propose PoLO, a unified framework that simultaneously achieves PoL and PoO using chained watermarks. PoLO splits the training process into fine-grained training shards and embeds a dedicated watermark in each shard. Each watermark is generated using the hash of the preceding shard, certifying the training process of the preceding shard. The chained structure makes it computationally difficult to forge any individual part of the whole training process. The complete set of watermarks serves as the PoL, while the final watermark provides the PoO. PoLO offers more efficient and privacy-preserving verification compared to the vanilla PoL solutions that rely on gradient-based trajectory tracing and inadvertently expose training data during verification, while maintaining the same level of ownership assurance of watermark-based PoO schemes. Our evaluation shows that PoLO achieves 99% watermark detection accuracy for ownership verification, while preserving data privacy and cutting verification costs to just 1.5-10% of traditional methods. Forging PoLO demands 1.1-4x more resources than honest proof generation, with the original proof retaining over 90% detection accuracy even after attacks.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12296v1
Reasoning Large Language Model Errors Arise from Hallucinating Critical   Problem Features,"Large language models have recently made great strides in reasoning task performance through chain-of-thought (CoT) strategies trained via reinforcement learning; however, these ""reasoning large language models"" (RLLMs) remain imperfect reasoners, and understanding the frequencies and causes of their failure modes is important for both users and developers. We test o1-mini, o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, and Grok 3 Mini Beta on graph coloring as a variable-complexity constraint-satisfaction logic problem, and find evidence from both error rate comparisons and CoT/explanation text analysis that RLLMs are prone to hallucinate edges not specified in the prompt's description of the graph. This phenomenon persists across multiple problem complexity levels and semantic frames, and it appears to account for a significant fraction of the incorrect answers from every tested model, and the vast majority of them for some models. Our results indicate that RLLMs may possess broader issues with misrepresentation of problem specifics, and we offer suggestions for design choices to mitigate this weakness.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12151v1
"NTIRE 2025 Challenge on Efficient Burst HDR and Restoration: Datasets,   Methods, and Results","This paper reviews the NTIRE 2025 Efficient Burst HDR and Restoration Challenge, which aims to advance efficient multi-frame high dynamic range (HDR) and restoration techniques. The challenge is based on a novel RAW multi-frame fusion dataset, comprising nine noisy and misaligned RAW frames with various exposure levels per scene.

Cross-Cloud Data Privacy Protection: Optimizing Collaborative Mechanisms   of AI Systems by Integrating Federated Learning and LLMs,"In the age of cloud computing, data privacy protection has become a major challenge, especially when sharing sensitive data across cloud environments. However, how to optimize collaboration across cloud environments remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we combine federated learning with large-scale language models to optimize the collaborative mechanism of AI systems. Based on the existing federated learning framework, we introduce a cross-cloud architecture in which federated learning works by aggregating model updates from decentralized nodes without exposing the original data. At the same time, combined with large-scale language models, its powerful context and semantic understanding capabilities are used to improve model training efficiency and decision-making ability. We've further innovated by introducing a secure communication layer to ensure the privacy and integrity of model updates and training data. The model enables continuous model adaptation and fine-tuning across different cloud environments while protecting sensitive data. Experimental results show that the proposed method is significantly better than the traditional federated learning model in terms of accuracy, convergence speed and data privacy protection.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13292v1
Reasoning-CV: Fine-tuning Powerful Reasoning LLMs for Knowledge-Assisted   Claim Verification,"Claim verification is essential in combating misinformation, and large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged in this area as powerful tools for assessing the veracity of claims using external knowledge. Existing LLM-based methods for claim verification typically adopt a Decompose-Then-Verify paradigm, which involves decomposing complex claims into several independent sub-claims and verifying each sub-claim separately. However, this paradigm often introduces errors during the claim decomposition process. To mitigate these errors, we propose to develop the Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-Verify paradigm, which leverages LLM reasoning methods to generate CoT-verification paths for the original complex claim without requiring decompositions into sub-claims and separate verification stages. The CoT-Verify paradigm allows us to propose a natural fine-tuning method called Reasoning-CV to enhance the verification capabilities in LLMs. Reasoning-CV includes a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage and a self-improvement direct preference optimization (DPO) stage. Utilizing only an 8B pre-trained LLM, Reasoning-CV demonstrates superior knowledge-assisted claim verification performances compared to existing Decompose-Then-Verify methods, as well as powerful black-box LLMs such as GPT-4o+CoT and o1-preview. Our code is available.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12348v1
Can Large Multimodal Models Understand Agricultural Scenes? Benchmarking   with AgroMind,"Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has demonstrated capabilities across various domains, but comprehensive benchmarks for agricultural remote sensing (RS) remain scarce. Existing benchmarks designed for agricultural RS scenarios exhibit notable limitations, primarily in terms of insufficient scene diversity in the dataset and oversimplified task design. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgroMind, a comprehensive agricultural remote sensing benchmark covering four task dimensions: spatial perception, object understanding, scene understanding, and scene reasoning, with a total of 13 task types, ranging from crop identification and health monitoring to environmental analysis. We curate a high-quality evaluation set by integrating eight public datasets and one private farmland plot dataset, containing 25,026 QA pairs and 15,556 images. The pipeline begins with multi-source data preprocessing, including collection, format standardization, and annotation refinement. We then generate a diverse set of agriculturally relevant questions through the systematic definition of tasks. Finally, we employ LMMs for inference, generating responses, and performing detailed examinations. We evaluated 18 open-source LMMs and 3 closed-source models on AgroMind. Experiments reveal significant performance gaps, particularly in spatial reasoning and fine-grained recognition, it is notable that human performance lags behind several leading LMMs. By establishing a standardized evaluation framework for agricultural RS, AgroMind reveals the limitations of LMMs in domain knowledge and highlights critical challenges for future work.

MPRM: A Markov Path-based Rule Miner for Efficient and Interpretable   Knowledge Graph Reasoning,"Rule mining in knowledge graphs enables interpretable link prediction. However, deep learning-based rule mining methods face significant memory and time challenges for large-scale knowledge graphs, whereas traditional approaches, limited by rigid confidence metrics, incur high computational costs despite sampling techniques. To address these challenges, we propose MPRM, a novel rule mining method that models rule-based inference as a Markov chain and uses an efficient confidence metric derived from aggregated path probabilities, significantly lowering computational demands. Experiments on multiple datasets show that MPRM efficiently mines knowledge graphs with over a million facts, sampling less than 1% of facts on a single CPU in 22 seconds, while preserving interpretability and boosting inference accuracy by up to 11% over baselines.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12329v1
PSC: Extending Context Window of Large Language Models via Phase Shift   Calibration,"Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is an efficient position encoding approach and is widely utilized in numerous large language models (LLMs). Recently, a lot of methods have been put forward to further expand the context window based on RoPE. The core concept of those methods is to predefine or search for a set of factors to rescale the base frequencies of RoPE. Nevertheless, it is quite a challenge for existing methods to predefine an optimal factor due to the exponential search space. In view of this, we introduce PSC (Phase Shift Calibration), a small module for calibrating the frequencies predefined by existing methods. With the employment of PSC, we demonstrate that many existing methods can be further enhanced, like PI, YaRN, and LongRoPE. We conducted extensive experiments across multiple models and tasks. The results demonstrate that (1) when PSC is enabled, the comparative reductions in perplexity increase as the context window size is varied from 16k, to 32k, and up to 64k. (2) Our approach is broadly applicable and exhibits robustness across a variety of models and tasks. The code can be found at https://github.com/WNQzhu/PSC.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12423v1
AI-Driven Automation Can Become the Foundation of Next-Era Science of   Science Research,"The Science of Science (SoS) explores the mechanisms underlying scientific discovery, and offers valuable insights for enhancing scientific efficiency and fostering innovation. Traditional approaches often rely on simplistic assumptions and basic statistical tools, such as linear regression and rule-based simulations, which struggle to capture the complexity and scale of modern research ecosystems. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) presents a transformative opportunity for the next generation of SoS, enabling the automation of large-scale pattern discovery and uncovering insights previously unattainable. This paper offers a forward-looking perspective on the integration of Science of Science with AI for automated research pattern discovery and highlights key open challenges that could greatly benefit from AI. We outline the advantages of AI over traditional methods, discuss potential limitations, and propose pathways to overcome them. Additionally, we present a preliminary multi-agent system as an illustrative example to simulate research societies, showcasing AI's ability to replicate real-world research patterns and accelerate progress in Science of Science research.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12039v1
Towards Visuospatial Cognition via Hierarchical Fusion of Visual Experts,"While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at general vision-language tasks, visuospatial cognition - reasoning about spatial layouts, relations, and dynamics - remains a significant challenge. Existing models often lack the necessary architectural components and specialized training data for fine-grained spatial understanding. We introduce ViCA2 (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant 2), a novel MLLM designed to enhance spatial reasoning. ViCA2 features a dual vision encoder architecture integrating SigLIP for semantics and Hiera for spatial structure, coupled with a token ratio control mechanism for efficiency. We also developed ViCA-322K, a new large-scale dataset with over 322,000 spatially grounded question-answer pairs for targeted instruction tuning. On the challenging VSI-Bench benchmark, our ViCA2-7B model achieves a state-of-the-art average score of 56.8, significantly surpassing larger open-source models (e.g., LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B, 40.9) and leading proprietary models (Gemini-1.5 Pro, 45.4). This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in achieving strong visuospatial intelligence with a compact model. We release ViCA2, its codebase, and the ViCA-322K dataset to facilitate further research.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12363v1
Accelerating Adaptive Retrieval Augmented Generation via   Instruction-Driven Representation Reduction of Retrieval Overlaps,"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a pivotal method for expanding the knowledge of large language models. To handle complex queries more effectively, researchers developed Adaptive-RAG (A-RAG) to enhance the generated quality through multiple interactions with external knowledge bases. Despite its effectiveness, A-RAG exacerbates the pre-existing efficiency challenges inherent in RAG, which are attributable to its reliance on multiple iterations of generation. Existing A-RAG approaches process all retrieved contents from scratch. However, they ignore the situation where there is a significant overlap in the content of the retrieval results across rounds. The overlapping content is redundantly represented, which leads to a large proportion of repeated computations, thus affecting the overall efficiency. To address this issue, this paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that can be generally applied to A-RAG methods, which is dedicated to reducing the redundant representation process caused by the overlapping of retrieval results. Specifically, we use cache access and parallel generation to speed up the prefilling and decoding stages respectively. Additionally, we also propose an instruction-driven module to further guide the model to more effectively attend to each part of the content in a more suitable way for LLMs. Experiments show that our approach achieves 2.79 and 2.33 times significant acceleration on average for prefilling and decoding respectively while maintaining equal generation quality.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12731v1
Dynamic Graph Induced Contour-aware Heat Conduction Network for   Event-based Object Detection,"Event-based Vision Sensors (EVS) have demonstrated significant advantages over traditional RGB frame-based cameras in low-light conditions, high-speed motion capture, and low latency. Consequently, object detection based on EVS has attracted increasing attention from researchers. Current event stream object detection algorithms are typically built upon Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers, which either capture limited local features using convolutional filters or incur high computational costs due to the utilization of self-attention. Recently proposed vision heat conduction backbone networks have shown a good balance between efficiency and accuracy; however, these models are not specifically designed for event stream data. They exhibit weak capability in modeling object contour information and fail to exploit the benefits of multi-scale features. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel dynamic graph induced contour-aware heat conduction network for event stream based object detection, termed CvHeat-DET. The proposed model effectively leverages the clear contour information inherent in event streams to predict the thermal diffusivity coefficients within the heat conduction model, and integrates hierarchical structural graph features to enhance feature learning across multiple scales. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets for event stream-based object detection fully validated the effectiveness of the proposed model. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenEvDET.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12908v1
Towards Open-world Generalized Deepfake Detection: General Feature   Extraction via Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"With the development of generative artificial intelligence, new forgery methods are rapidly emerging. Social platforms are flooded with vast amounts of unlabeled synthetic data and authentic data, making it increasingly challenging to distinguish real from fake. Due to the lack of labels, existing supervised detection methods struggle to effectively address the detection of unknown deepfake methods. Moreover, in open world scenarios, the amount of unlabeled data greatly exceeds that of labeled data. Therefore, we define a new deepfake detection generalization task which focuses on how to achieve efficient detection of large amounts of unlabeled data based on limited labeled data to simulate a open world scenario. To solve the above mentioned task, we propose a novel Open-World Deepfake Detection Generalization Enhancement Training Strategy (OWG-DS) to improve the generalization ability of existing methods. Our approach aims to transfer deepfake detection knowledge from a small amount of labeled source domain data to large-scale unlabeled target domain data. Specifically, we introduce the Domain Distance Optimization (DDO) module to align different domain features by optimizing both inter-domain and intra-domain distances. Additionally, the Similarity-based Class Boundary Separation (SCBS) module is used to enhance the aggregation of similar samples to ensure clearer class boundaries, while an adversarial training mechanism is adopted to learn the domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments show that the proposed deepfake detection generalization enhancement training strategy excels in cross-method and cross-dataset scenarios, improving the model's generalization.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12339v1
Exploring Criteria of Loss Reweighting to Enhance LLM Unlearning,"Loss reweighting has shown significant benefits for machine unlearning with large language models (LLMs). However, their exact functionalities are left unclear and the optimal strategy remains an open question, thus impeding the understanding and improvement of existing methodologies. In this paper, we identify two distinct goals of loss reweighting, namely, Saturation and Importance -- the former indicates that those insufficiently optimized data should be emphasized, while the latter stresses some critical data that are most influential for loss minimization. To study their usefulness, we design specific reweighting strategies for each goal and evaluate their respective effects on unlearning. We conduct extensive empirical analyses on well-established benchmarks, and summarize some important observations as follows: (i) Saturation enhances efficacy more than importance-based reweighting, and their combination can yield additional improvements. (ii) Saturation typically allocates lower weights to data with lower likelihoods, whereas importance-based reweighting does the opposite. (iii) The efficacy of unlearning is also largely influenced by the smoothness and granularity of the weight distributions. Based on these findings, we propose SatImp, a simple reweighting method that combines the advantages of both saturation and importance. Empirical results on extensive datasets validate the efficacy of our method, potentially bridging existing research gaps and indicating directions for future research. Our code is available at https://github.com/Puning97/SatImp-for-LLM-Unlearning.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11953v1
Topology-Aware Knowledge Propagation in Decentralized Learning,"Decentralized learning enables collaborative training of models across naturally distributed data without centralized coordination or maintenance of a global model. Instead, devices are organized in arbitrary communication topologies, in which they can only communicate with neighboring devices. Each device maintains its own local model by training on its local data and integrating new knowledge via model aggregation with neighbors. Therefore, knowledge is propagated across the topology via successive aggregation rounds. We study, in particular, the propagation of out-of-distribution (OOD) knowledge. We find that popular decentralized learning algorithms struggle to propagate OOD knowledge effectively to all devices. Further, we find that both the location of OOD data within a topology, and the topology itself, significantly impact OOD knowledge propagation. We then propose topology-aware aggregation strategies to accelerate (OOD) knowledge propagation across devices. These strategies improve OOD data accuracy, compared to topology-unaware baselines, by 123% on average across models in a topology.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11760v1
RoboFAC: A Comprehensive Framework for Robotic Failure Analysis and   Correction,"Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently advanced robotic manipulation by translating natural-language instructions and image information into sequential control actions. However, these models often underperform in open-world scenarios, as they are predominantly trained on successful expert demonstrations and exhibit a limited capacity for failure recovery. In this work, we present a Robotic Failure Analysis and Correction (RoboFAC) framework to address this issue. Firstly, we construct RoboFAC dataset comprising 9,440 erroneous manipulation trajectories and 78,623 QA pairs across 16 diverse tasks and 53 scenes in both simulation and real-world environments. Leveraging our dataset, we develop RoboFAC model, which is capable of Task Understanding, Failure Analysis and Failure Correction. Experimental results demonstrate that the RoboFAC model outperforms GPT-4o by 34.1% on our evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, we integrate the RoboFAC model into a real-world VLA control pipeline as an external supervision providing correction instructions, yielding a 29.1% relative improvement on average on four real-world tasks. The results show that our RoboFAC framework effectively handles robotic failures and assists the VLA model in recovering from failures.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12224v1
Multilingual Collaborative Defense for Large Language Models,"The robustness and security of large language models (LLMs) has become a prominent research area. One notable vulnerability is the ability to bypass LLM safeguards by translating harmful queries into rare or underrepresented languages, a simple yet effective method of ""jailbreaking"" these models. Despite the growing concern, there has been limited research addressing the safeguarding of LLMs in multilingual scenarios, highlighting an urgent need to enhance multilingual safety. In this work, we investigate the correlation between various attack features across different languages and propose Multilingual Collaborative Defense (MCD), a novel learning method that optimizes a continuous, soft safety prompt automatically to facilitate multilingual safeguarding of LLMs. The MCD approach offers three advantages: First, it effectively improves safeguarding performance across multiple languages. Second, MCD maintains strong generalization capabilities while minimizing false refusal rates. Third, MCD mitigates the language safety misalignment caused by imbalances in LLM training corpora. To evaluate the effectiveness of MCD, we manually construct multilingual versions of commonly used jailbreak benchmarks, such as MaliciousInstruct and AdvBench, to assess various safeguarding methods. Additionally, we introduce these datasets in underrepresented (zero-shot) languages to verify the language transferability of MCD. The results demonstrate that MCD outperforms existing approaches in safeguarding against multilingual jailbreak attempts while also exhibiting strong language transfer capabilities.

MedAgentBoard: Benchmarking Multi-Agent Collaboration with Conventional   Methods for Diverse Medical Tasks,"The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has stimulated interest in multi-agent collaboration for addressing complex medical tasks. However, the practical advantages of multi-agent collaboration approaches remain insufficiently understood. Existing evaluations often lack generalizability, failing to cover diverse tasks reflective of real-world clinical practice, and frequently omit rigorous comparisons against both single-LLM-based and established conventional methods. To address this critical gap, we introduce MedAgentBoard, a comprehensive benchmark for the systematic evaluation of multi-agent collaboration, single-LLM, and conventional approaches. MedAgentBoard encompasses four diverse medical task categories: (1) medical (visual) question answering, (2) lay summary generation, (3) structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) predictive modeling, and (4) clinical workflow automation, across text, medical images, and structured EHR data. Our extensive experiments reveal a nuanced landscape: while multi-agent collaboration demonstrates benefits in specific scenarios, such as enhancing task completeness in clinical workflow automation, it does not consistently outperform advanced single LLMs (e.g., in textual medical QA) or, critically, specialized conventional methods that generally maintain better performance in tasks like medical VQA and EHR-based prediction. MedAgentBoard offers a vital resource and actionable insights, emphasizing the necessity of a task-specific, evidence-based approach to selecting and developing AI solutions in medicine. It underscores that the inherent complexity and overhead of multi-agent collaboration must be carefully weighed against tangible performance gains. All code, datasets, detailed prompts, and experimental results are open-sourced at https://medagentboard.netlify.app/.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12371v1
ExTrans: Multilingual Deep Reasoning Translation via Exemplar-Enhanced   Reinforcement Learning,"In recent years, the emergence of large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, has shown impressive capabilities in complex problems, e.g., mathematics and coding. Some pioneering studies attempt to bring the success of LRMs in neural machine translation (MT). They try to build LRMs with deep reasoning MT ability via reinforcement learning (RL). Despite some progress that has been made, these attempts generally focus on several high-resource languages, e.g., English and Chinese, leaving the performance on other languages unclear. Besides, the reward modeling methods in previous work do not fully unleash the potential of reinforcement learning in MT. In this work, we first design a new reward modeling method that compares the translation results of the policy MT model with a strong LRM (i.e., DeepSeek-R1-671B), and quantifies the comparisons to provide rewards. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the reward modeling method. Using Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as the backbone, the trained model achieves the new state-of-the-art performance in literary translation, and outperforms strong LRMs including OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeeK-R1. Furthermore, we extend our method to the multilingual settings with 11 languages. With a carefully designed lightweight reward modeling in RL, we can simply transfer the strong MT ability from a single direction into multiple (i.e., 90) translation directions and achieve impressive multilingual MT performance.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12996v1
$μ$PC: Scaling Predictive Coding to 100+ Layer Networks,"The biological implausibility of backpropagation (BP) has motivated many alternative, brain-inspired algorithms that attempt to rely only on local information, such as predictive coding (PC) and equilibrium propagation. However, these algorithms have notoriously struggled to train very deep networks, preventing them from competing with BP in large-scale settings. Indeed, scaling PC networks (PCNs) has recently been posed as a challenge for the community (Pinchetti et al., 2024). Here, we show that 100+ layer PCNs can be trained reliably using a Depth-$\mu$P parameterisation (Yang et al., 2023; Bordelon et al., 2023) which we call ""$\mu$PC"". Through an extensive analysis of the scaling behaviour of PCNs, we reveal several pathologies that make standard PCNs difficult to train at large depths. We then show that, despite addressing only some of these instabilities, $\mu$PC allows stable training of very deep (up to 128-layer) residual networks on simple classification tasks with competitive performance and little tuning compared to current benchmarks. Moreover, $\mu$PC enables zero-shot transfer of both weight and activity learning rates across widths and depths. Our results have implications for other local algorithms and could be extended to convolutional and transformer architectures. Code for $\mu$PC is made available as part of a JAX library for PCNs at https://github.com/thebuckleylab/jpc (Innocenti et al., 2024).",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13124v1
Learning Pareto-Optimal Rewards from Noisy Preferences: A Framework for   Multi-Objective Inverse Reinforcement Learning,"As generative agents become increasingly capable, alignment of their behavior with complex human values remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches often simplify human intent through reduction to a scalar reward, overlooking the multi-faceted nature of human feedback. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework for preference-based Multi-Objective Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MO-IRL), where human preferences are modeled as latent vector-valued reward functions. We formalize the problem of recovering a Pareto-optimal reward representation from noisy preference queries and establish conditions for identifying the underlying multi-objective structure. We derive tight sample complexity bounds for recovering $\epsilon$-approximations of the Pareto front and introduce a regret formulation to quantify suboptimality in this multi-objective setting. Furthermore, we propose a provably convergent algorithm for policy optimization using preference-inferred reward cones. Our results bridge the gap between practical alignment techniques and theoretical guarantees, providing a principled foundation for learning aligned behaviors in a high-dimension and value-pluralistic environment.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11864v1
A Generalized Label Shift Perspective for Cross-Domain Gaze Estimation,"Aiming to generalize the well-trained gaze estimation model to new target domains, Cross-domain Gaze Estimation (CDGE) is developed for real-world application scenarios. Existing CDGE methods typically extract the domain-invariant features to mitigate domain shift in feature space, which is proved insufficient by Generalized Label Shift (GLS) theory. In this paper, we introduce a novel GLS perspective to CDGE and modelize the cross-domain problem by label and conditional shift problem. A GLS correction framework is presented and a feasible realization is proposed, in which a importance reweighting strategy based on truncated Gaussian distribution is introduced to overcome the continuity challenges in label shift correction. To embed the reweighted source distribution to conditional invariant learning, we further derive a probability-aware estimation of conditional operator discrepancy. Extensive experiments on standard CDGE tasks with different backbone models validate the superior generalization capability across domain and applicability on various models of proposed method.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13043v1
Evaluatiing the efficacy of LLM Safety Solutions : The Palit Benchmark   Dataset,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into critical systems in industries like healthcare and finance. Users can often submit queries to LLM-enabled chatbots, some of which can enrich responses with information retrieved from internal databases storing sensitive data. This gives rise to a range of attacks in which a user submits a malicious query and the LLM-system outputs a response that creates harm to the owner, such as leaking internal data or creating legal liability by harming a third-party. While security tools are being developed to counter these threats, there is little formal evaluation of their effectiveness and usability. This study addresses this gap by conducting a thorough comparative analysis of LLM security tools. We identified 13 solutions (9 closed-source, 4 open-source), but only 7 were evaluated due to a lack of participation by proprietary model owners.To evaluate, we built a benchmark dataset of malicious prompts, and evaluate these tools performance against a baseline LLM model (ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo). Our results show that the baseline model has too many false positives to be used for this task. Lakera Guard and ProtectAI LLM Guard emerged as the best overall tools showcasing the tradeoff between usability and performance. The study concluded with recommendations for greater transparency among closed source providers, improved context-aware detections, enhanced open-source engagement, increased user awareness, and the adoption of more representative performance metrics.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13028v1
Structure-based Anomaly Detection and Clustering,"Anomaly detection is a fundamental problem in domains such as healthcare, manufacturing, and cybersecurity. This thesis proposes new unsupervised methods for anomaly detection in both structured and streaming data settings. In the first part, we focus on structure-based anomaly detection, where normal data follows low-dimensional manifolds while anomalies deviate from them. We introduce Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), which embeds data into a high-dimensional preference space via manifold fitting, and isolates outliers using two variants: Voronoi-iForest, based on geometric distances, and RuzHash-iForest, leveraging Locality Sensitive Hashing for scalability. We also propose Sliding-PIF, which captures local manifold information for streaming scenarios. Our methods outperform existing techniques on synthetic and real datasets. We extend this to structure-based clustering with MultiLink, a novel method for recovering multiple geometric model families in noisy data. MultiLink merges clusters via a model-aware linkage strategy, enabling robust multi-class structure recovery. It offers key advantages over existing approaches, such as speed, reduced sensitivity to thresholds, and improved robustness to poor initial sampling. The second part of the thesis addresses online anomaly detection in evolving data streams. We propose Online Isolation Forest (Online-iForest), which uses adaptive, multi-resolution histograms and dynamically updates tree structures to track changes over time. It avoids retraining while achieving accuracy comparable to offline models, with superior efficiency for real-time applications. Finally, we tackle anomaly detection in cybersecurity via open-set recognition for malware classification. We enhance a Gradient Boosting classifier with MaxLogit to detect unseen malware families, a method now integrated into Cleafy's production system.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12751v1
ViEEG: Hierarchical Neural Coding with Cross-Modal Progressive   Enhancement for EEG-Based Visual Decoding,"Understanding and decoding brain activity into visual representations is a fundamental challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While EEG-based visual decoding has shown promise due to its non-invasive, low-cost nature and millisecond-level temporal resolution, existing methods are limited by their reliance on flat neural representations that overlook the brain's inherent visual hierarchy. In this paper, we introduce ViEEG, a biologically inspired hierarchical EEG decoding framework that aligns with the Hubel-Wiesel theory of visual processing. ViEEG decomposes each visual stimulus into three biologically aligned components-contour, foreground object, and contextual scene-serving as anchors for a three-stream EEG encoder. These EEG features are progressively integrated via cross-attention routing, simulating cortical information flow from V1 to IT to the association cortex. We further adopt hierarchical contrastive learning to align EEG representations with CLIP embeddings, enabling zero-shot object recognition. Extensive experiments on the THINGS-EEG dataset demonstrate that ViEEG achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 40.9% Top-1 accuracy in subject-dependent and 22.9% Top-1 accuracy in cross-subject settings, surpassing existing methods by over 45%. Our framework not only advances the performance frontier but also sets a new paradigm for biologically grounded brain decoding in AI.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12408v1
FLOW-BENCH: Towards Conversational Generation of Enterprise Workflows,"Business process automation (BPA) that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert natural language (NL) instructions into structured business process artifacts is becoming a hot research topic. This paper makes two technical contributions -- (i) FLOW-BENCH, a high quality dataset of paired natural language instructions and structured business process definitions to evaluate NL-based BPA tools, and support bourgeoning research in this area, and (ii) FLOW-GEN, our approach to utilize LLMs to translate natural language into an intermediate representation with Python syntax that facilitates final conversion into widely adopted business process definition languages, such as BPMN and DMN. We bootstrap FLOW-BENCH by demonstrating how it can be used to evaluate the components of FLOW-GEN across eight LLMs of varying sizes. We hope that FLOW-GEN and FLOW-BENCH catalyze further research in BPA making it more accessible to novice and expert users.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11646v1
TSPulse: Dual Space Tiny Pre-Trained Models for Rapid Time-Series   Analysis,"The rise of time-series pre-trained models has advanced temporal representation learning, but current state-of-the-art models are often large-scale, requiring substantial compute. We introduce TSPulse, ultra-compact time-series pre-trained models with only 1M parameters, specialized to perform strongly across classification, anomaly detection, imputation, and retrieval tasks. TSPulse introduces innovations at both the architecture and task levels. At the architecture level, it employs a dual-space masked reconstruction, learning from both time and frequency domains to capture complementary signals. This is further enhanced by a dual-embedding disentanglement, generating both detailed embeddings for fine-grained analysis and high-level semantic embeddings for broader task understanding. Notably, TSPulse's semantic embeddings are robust to shifts in time, magnitude, and noise, which is important for robust retrieval. At the task level, TSPulse incorporates TSLens, a fine-tuning component enabling task-specific feature attention. It also introduces a multi-head triangulation technique that correlates deviations from multiple prediction heads, enhancing anomaly detection by fusing complementary model outputs. Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves zero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias. These architecture and task innovations collectively contribute to TSPulse's significant performance gains: 5-16% on the UEA classification benchmarks, +20% on the TSB-AD anomaly detection leaderboard, +50% in zero-shot imputation, and +25% in time-series retrieval. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just 1M parameters, making TSPulse 10-100X smaller than existing pre-trained models. Its efficiency enables GPU-free inference and rapid pre-training, setting a new standard for efficient time-series pre-trained models. Models will be open-sourced soon.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13033v1
"A Token is Worth over 1,000 Tokens: Efficient Knowledge Distillation   through Low-Rank Clone","Training high-performing Small Language Models (SLMs) remains costly, even with knowledge distillation and pruning from larger teacher models. Existing work often faces three key challenges: (1) information loss from hard pruning, (2) inefficient alignment of representations, and (3) underutilization of informative activations, particularly from Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs). To address these challenges, we introduce Low-Rank Clone (LRC), an efficient pre-training method that constructs SLMs aspiring to behavioral equivalence with strong teacher models. LRC trains a set of low-rank projection matrices that jointly enable soft pruning by compressing teacher weights, and activation clone by aligning student activations, including FFN signals, with those of the teacher. This unified design maximizes knowledge transfer while removing the need for explicit alignment modules. Extensive experiments with open-source teachers (e.g., Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-3B/7B-Instruct) show that LRC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models trained on trillions of tokens--while using only 20B tokens, achieving over 1,000x training efficiency. Our codes and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/CURRENTF/LowRankClone and https://huggingface.co/collections/JitaiHao/low-rank-clone-lrc-6828389e96a93f1d4219dfaf.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12781v1
Dynamic Sight Range Selection in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"Multi-agent reinforcement Learning (MARL) is often challenged by the sight range dilemma, where agents either receive insufficient or excessive information from their environment. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Dynamic Sight Range Selection (DSR), to address this issue. DSR utilizes an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and dynamically adjusts the sight range during training. Experiment results show several advantages of using DSR. First, we demonstrate using DSR achieves better performance in three common MARL environments, including Level-Based Foraging (LBF), Multi-Robot Warehouse (RWARE), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC). Second, our results show that DSR consistently improves performance across multiple MARL algorithms, including QMIX and MAPPO. Third, DSR offers suitable sight ranges for different training steps, thereby accelerating the training process. Finally, DSR provides additional interpretability by indicating the optimal sight range used during training. Unlike existing methods that rely on global information or communication mechanisms, our approach operates solely based on the individual sight ranges of agents. This approach offers a practical and efficient solution to the sight range dilemma, making it broadly applicable to real-world complex environments.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12811v1
Learnware of Language Models: Specialized Small Language Models Can Do   Big,"The learnware paradigm offers a novel approach to machine learning by enabling users to reuse a set of well-trained models for tasks beyond the models' original purposes. It eliminates the need to build models from scratch, instead relying on specifications (representations of a model's capabilities) to identify and leverage the most suitable models for new tasks. While learnware has proven effective in many scenarios, its application to language models has remained largely unexplored. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable universal question-answering abilities, yet they face challenges in specialized scenarios due to data scarcity, privacy concerns, and high computational costs, thus more and more specialized small language models (SLMs) are being trained for specific domains. To address these limitations systematically, the learnware paradigm provides a promising solution by enabling maximum utilization of specialized SLMs, and allowing users to identify and reuse them in a collaborative and privacy-preserving manner.   This paper presents a preliminary attempt to apply the learnware paradigm to language models. We simulated a learnware system comprising approximately 100 learnwares of specialized SLMs with 8B parameters, fine-tuned across finance, healthcare, and mathematics domains. Each learnware contains an SLM and a specification, which enables users to identify the most relevant models without exposing their own data. Experimental results demonstrate promising performance: by selecting one suitable learnware for each task-specific inference, the system outperforms the base SLMs on all benchmarks. Compared to LLMs, the system outperforms Qwen1.5-110B, Qwen2.5-72B, and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct by at least 14% in finance domain tasks, and surpasses Flan-PaLM-540B (ranked 7th on the Open Medical LLM Leaderboard) in medical domain tasks.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13425v1
Cloud-Based AI Systems: Leveraging Large Language Models for Intelligent   Fault Detection and Autonomous Self-Healing,"With the rapid development of cloud computing systems and the increasing complexity of their infrastructure, intelligent mechanisms to detect and mitigate failures in real time are becoming increasingly important. Traditional methods of failure detection are often difficult to cope with the scale and dynamics of modern cloud environments. In this study, we propose a novel AI framework based on Massive Language Model (LLM) for intelligent fault detection and self-healing mechanisms in cloud systems. The model combines existing machine learning fault detection algorithms with LLM's natural language understanding capabilities to process and parse system logs, error reports, and real-time data streams through semantic context. The method adopts a multi-level architecture, combined with supervised learning for fault classification and unsupervised learning for anomaly detection, so that the system can predict potential failures before they occur and automatically trigger the self-healing mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed model is significantly better than the traditional fault detection system in terms of fault detection accuracy, system downtime reduction and recovery speed.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11743v1
Improving Coverage in Combined Prediction Sets with Weighted p-values,"Conformal prediction quantifies the uncertainty of machine learning models by augmenting point predictions with valid prediction sets, assuming exchangeability. For complex scenarios involving multiple trials, models, or data sources, conformal prediction sets can be aggregated to create a prediction set that captures the overall uncertainty, often improving precision. However, aggregating multiple prediction sets with individual $1-\alpha$ coverage inevitably weakens the overall guarantee, typically resulting in $1-2\alpha$ worst-case coverage. In this work, we propose a framework for the weighted aggregation of prediction sets, where weights are assigned to each prediction set based on their contribution. Our framework offers flexible control over how the sets are aggregated, achieving tighter coverage bounds that interpolate between the $1-2\alpha$ guarantee of the combined models and the $1-\alpha$ guarantee of an individual model depending on the distribution of weights. We extend our framework to data-dependent weights, and we derive a general procedure for data-dependent weight aggregation that maintains finite-sample validity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through experiments on synthetic and real data in the mixture-of-experts setting, and we show that aggregation with data-dependent weights provides a form of adaptive coverage.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11785v1
Composing Dextrous Grasping and In-hand Manipulation via Scoring with a   Reinforcement Learning Critic,"In-hand manipulation and grasping are fundamental yet often separately addressed tasks in robotics. For deriving in-hand manipulation policies, reinforcement learning has recently shown great success. However, the derived controllers are not yet useful in real-world scenarios because they often require a human operator to place the objects in suitable initial (grasping) states. Finding stable grasps that also promote the desired in-hand manipulation goal is an open problem. In this work, we propose a method for bridging this gap by leveraging the critic network of a reinforcement learning agent trained for in-hand manipulation to score and select initial grasps. Our experiments show that this method significantly increases the success rate of in-hand manipulation without requiring additional training. We also present an implementation of a full grasp manipulation pipeline on a real-world system, enabling autonomous grasping and reorientation even of unwieldy objects.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13253v1
Joint Embedding vs Reconstruction: Provable Benefits of Latent Space   Prediction for Self Supervised Learning,"Reconstruction and joint embedding have emerged as two leading paradigms in Self Supervised Learning (SSL). Reconstruction methods focus on recovering the original sample from a different view in input space. On the other hand, joint embedding methods align the representations of different views in latent space. Both approaches offer compelling advantages, yet practitioners lack clear guidelines for choosing between them. In this work, we unveil the core mechanisms that distinguish each paradigm. By leveraging closed form solutions for both approaches, we precisely characterize how the view generation process, e.g. data augmentation, impacts the learned representations. We then demonstrate that, unlike supervised learning, both SSL paradigms require a minimal alignment between augmentations and irrelevant features to achieve asymptotic optimality with increasing sample size. Our findings indicate that in scenarios where these irrelevant features have a large magnitude, joint embedding methods are preferable because they impose a strictly weaker alignment condition compared to reconstruction based methods. These results not only clarify the trade offs between the two paradigms but also substantiate the empirical success of joint embedding approaches on real world challenging datasets.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12477v1
Text2midi-InferAlign: Improving Symbolic Music Generation with   Inference-Time Alignment,"We present Text2midi-InferAlign, a novel technique for improving symbolic music generation at inference time. Our method leverages text-to-audio alignment and music structural alignment rewards during inference to encourage the generated music to be consistent with the input caption. Specifically, we introduce two objectives scores: a text-audio consistency score that measures rhythmic alignment between the generated music and the original text caption, and a harmonic consistency score that penalizes generated music containing notes inconsistent with the key. By optimizing these alignment-based objectives during the generation process, our model produces symbolic music that is more closely tied to the input captions, thereby improving the overall quality and coherence of the generated compositions. Our approach can extend any existing autoregressive model without requiring further training or fine-tuning. We evaluate our work on top of Text2midi - an existing text-to-midi generation model, demonstrating significant improvements in both objective and subjective evaluation metrics.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12669v1
Improving Fairness in LLMs Through Testing-Time Adversaries,"Large Language Models (LLMs) push the bound-aries in natural language processing and generative AI, driving progress across various aspects of modern society. Unfortunately, the pervasive issue of bias in LLMs responses (i.e., predictions) poses a significant and open challenge, hindering their application in tasks involving ethical sensitivity and responsible decision-making. In this work, we propose a straightforward, user-friendly and practical method to mitigate such biases, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs. Our method creates multiple variations of a given sentence by modifying specific attributes and evaluates the corresponding prediction behavior compared to the original, unaltered, prediction/sentence. The idea behind this process is that critical ethical predictions often exhibit notable inconsistencies, indicating the presence of bias. Unlike previous approaches, our method relies solely on forward passes (i.e., testing-time adversaries), eliminating the need for training, fine-tuning, or prior knowledge of the training data distribution. Through extensive experiments on the popular Llama family, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving various fairness metrics, focusing on the reduction of disparities in how the model treats individuals from different racial groups. Specifically, using standard metrics, we improve the fairness in Llama3 in up to 27 percentage points. Overall, our approach significantly enhances fairness, equity, and reliability in LLM-generated results without parameter tuning or training data modifications, confirming its effectiveness in practical scenarios. We believe our work establishes an important step toward enabling the use of LLMs in tasks that require ethical considerations and responsible decision-making.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12100v1
CHRIS: Clothed Human Reconstruction with Side View Consistency,"Creating a realistic clothed human from a single-view RGB image is crucial for applications like mixed reality and filmmaking. Despite some progress in recent years, mainstream methods often fail to fully utilize side-view information, as the input single-view image contains front-view information only. This leads to globally unrealistic topology and local surface inconsistency in side views. To address these, we introduce Clothed Human Reconstruction with Side View Consistency, namely CHRIS, which consists of 1) A Side-View Normal Discriminator that enhances global visual reasonability by distinguishing the generated side-view normals from the ground truth ones; 2) A Multi-to-One Gradient Computation (M2O) that ensures local surface consistency. M2O calculates the gradient of a sampling point by integrating the gradients of the nearby points, effectively acting as a smooth operation. Experimental results demonstrate that CHRIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks and outperforms the prior work.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12005v1
A Classical View on Benign Overfitting: The Role of Sample Size,"Benign overfitting is a phenomenon in machine learning where a model perfectly fits (interpolates) the training data, including noisy examples, yet still generalizes well to unseen data. Understanding this phenomenon has attracted considerable attention in recent years. In this work, we introduce a conceptual shift, by focusing on almost benign overfitting, where models simultaneously achieve both arbitrarily small training and test errors. This behavior is characteristic of neural networks, which often achieve low (but non-zero) training error while still generalizing well. We hypothesize that this almost benign overfitting can emerge even in classical regimes, by analyzing how the interaction between sample size and model complexity enables larger models to achieve both good training fit but still approach Bayes-optimal generalization. We substantiate this hypothesis with theoretical evidence from two case studies: (i) kernel ridge regression, and (ii) least-squares regression using a two-layer fully connected ReLU neural network trained via gradient flow. In both cases, we overcome the strong assumptions often required in prior work on benign overfitting.   Our results on neural networks also provide the first generalization result in this setting that does not rely on any assumptions about the underlying regression function or noise, beyond boundedness. Our analysis introduces a novel proof technique based on decomposing the excess risk into estimation and approximation errors, interpreting gradient flow as an implicit regularizer, that helps avoid uniform convergence traps. This analysis idea could be of independent interest.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11621v1
Leveraging LLM Inconsistency to Boost Pass@k Performance,"Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive abilities in numerous domains, but exhibit inconsistent performance in response to minor input changes. Rather than view this as a drawback, in this paper we introduce a novel method for leveraging models' inconsistency to boost Pass@k performance. Specifically, we present a ""Variator"" agent that generates k variants of a given task and submits one candidate solution for each one. Our variant generation approach is applicable to a wide range of domains as it is task agnostic and compatible with free-form inputs. We demonstrate the efficacy of our agent theoretically using a probabilistic model of the inconsistency effect, and show empirically that it outperforms the baseline on the APPS dataset. Furthermore, we establish that inconsistency persists even in frontier reasoning models across coding and cybersecurity domains, suggesting our method is likely to remain relevant for future model generations.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12938v1
RealMath: A Continuous Benchmark for Evaluating Language Models on   Research-Level Mathematics,"Existing benchmarks for evaluating mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) rely primarily on competition problems, formal proofs, or artificially challenging questions -- failing to capture the nature of mathematics encountered in actual research environments. We introduce RealMath, a novel benchmark derived directly from research papers and mathematical forums that assesses LLMs' abilities on authentic mathematical tasks. Our approach addresses three critical challenges: sourcing diverse research-level content, enabling reliable automated evaluation through verifiable statements, and designing a continually refreshable dataset to mitigate contamination risks. Experimental results across multiple LLMs reveal surprising capabilities in handling research mathematics compared to competition problems, suggesting current models may already serve as valuable assistants for working mathematicians despite limitations on highly challenging problems. The code and dataset for RealMath are publicly available.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12575v1
Multi-CALF: A Policy Combination Approach with Statistical Guarantees,"We introduce Multi-CALF, an algorithm that intelligently combines reinforcement learning policies based on their relative value improvements. Our approach integrates a standard RL policy with a theoretically-backed alternative policy, inheriting formal stability guarantees while often achieving better performance than either policy individually. We prove that our combined policy converges to a specified goal set with known probability and provide precise bounds on maximum deviation and convergence time. Empirical validation on control tasks demonstrates enhanced performance while maintaining stability guarantees.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12350v1
How Adding Metacognitive Requirements in Support of AI Feedback in   Practice Exams Transforms Student Learning Behaviors,"Providing personalized, detailed feedback at scale in large undergraduate STEM courses remains a persistent challenge. We present an empirically evaluated practice exam system that integrates AI generated feedback with targeted textbook references, deployed in a large introductory biology course. Our system encourages metacognitive behavior by asking students to explain their answers and declare their confidence. It uses OpenAI's GPT-4o to generate personalized feedback based on this information, while directing them to relevant textbook sections. Through interaction logs from consenting participants across three midterms (541, 342, and 413 students respectively), totaling 28,313 question-student interactions across 146 learning objectives, along with 279 surveys and 23 interviews, we examined the system's impact on learning outcomes and engagement. Across all midterms, feedback types showed no statistically significant performance differences, though some trends suggested potential benefits. The most substantial impact came from the required confidence ratings and explanations, which students reported transferring to their actual exam strategies. About 40 percent of students engaged with textbook references when prompted by feedback -- far higher than traditional reading rates. Survey data revealed high satisfaction (mean rating 4.1 of 5), with 82.1 percent reporting increased confidence on practiced midterm topics, and 73.4 percent indicating they could recall and apply specific concepts. Our findings suggest that embedding structured reflection requirements may be more impactful than sophisticated feedback mechanisms.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13381v1
Beyond Accuracy: EcoL2 Metric for Sustainable Neural PDE Solvers,"Real-world systems, from aerospace to railway engineering, are modeled with partial differential equations (PDEs) describing the physics of the system. Estimating robust solutions for such problems is essential. Deep learning-based architectures, such as neural PDE solvers, have recently gained traction as a reliable solution method. The current state of development of these approaches, however, primarily focuses on improving accuracy. The environmental impact of excessive computation, leading to increased carbon emissions, has largely been overlooked. This paper introduces a carbon emission measure for a range of PDE solvers. Our proposed metric, EcoL2, balances model accuracy with emissions across data collection, model training, and deployment. Experiments across both physics-informed machine learning and operator learning architectures demonstrate that the proposed metric presents a holistic assessment of model performance and emission cost. As such solvers grow in scale and deployment, EcoL2 represents a step toward building performant scientific machine learning systems with lower long-term environmental impact.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12556v1
Position Paper: Bounded Alignment: What (Not) To Expect From AGI Agents,"The issues of AI risk and AI safety are becoming critical as the prospect of artificial general intelligence (AGI) looms larger. The emergence of extremely large and capable generative models has led to alarming predictions and created a stir from boardrooms to legislatures. As a result, AI alignment has emerged as one of the most important areas in AI research. The goal of this position paper is to argue that the currently dominant vision of AGI in the AI and machine learning (AI/ML) community needs to evolve, and that expectations and metrics for its safety must be informed much more by our understanding of the only existing instance of general intelligence, i.e., the intelligence found in animals, and especially in humans. This change in perspective will lead to a more realistic view of the technology, and allow for better policy decisions.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11866v1
Diffmv: A Unified Diffusion Framework for Healthcare Predictions with   Random Missing Views and View Laziness,"Advanced healthcare predictions offer significant improvements in patient outcomes by leveraging predictive analytics. Existing works primarily utilize various views of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, such as diagnoses, lab tests, or clinical notes, for model training. These methods typically assume the availability of complete EHR views and that the designed model could fully leverage the potential of each view. However, in practice, random missing views and view laziness present two significant challenges that hinder further improvements in multi-view utilization. To address these challenges, we introduce Diffmv, an innovative diffusion-based generative framework designed to advance the exploitation of multiple views of EHR data. Specifically, to address random missing views, we integrate various views of EHR data into a unified diffusion-denoising framework, enriched with diverse contextual conditions to facilitate progressive alignment and view transformation. To mitigate view laziness, we propose a novel reweighting strategy that assesses the relative advantages of each view, promoting a balanced utilization of various data views within the model. Our proposed strategy achieves superior performance across multiple health prediction tasks derived from three popular datasets, including multi-view and multi-modality scenarios.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11802v1
Hyperbolic Residual Quantization: Discrete Representations for Data with   Latent Hierarchies,"Hierarchical data arise in countless domains, from biological taxonomies and organizational charts to legal codes and knowledge graphs. Residual Quantization (RQ) is widely used to generate discrete, multitoken representations for such data by iteratively quantizing residuals in a multilevel codebook. However, its reliance on Euclidean geometry can introduce fundamental mismatches that hinder modeling of hierarchical branching, necessary for faithful representation of hierarchical data. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Residual Quantization (HRQ), which embeds data natively in a hyperbolic manifold and performs residual quantization using hyperbolic operations and distance metrics. By adapting the embedding network, residual computation, and distance metric to hyperbolic geometry, HRQ imparts an inductive bias that aligns naturally with hierarchical branching. We claim that HRQ in comparison to RQ can generate more useful for downstream tasks discrete hierarchical representations for data with latent hierarchies. We evaluate HRQ on two tasks: supervised hierarchy modeling using WordNet hypernym trees, where the model is supervised to learn the latent hierarchy - and hierarchy discovery, where, while latent hierarchy exists in the data, the model is not directly trained or evaluated on a task related to the hierarchy. Across both scenarios, HRQ hierarchical tokens yield better performance on downstream tasks compared to Euclidean RQ with gains of up to $20\%$ for the hierarchy modeling task. Our results demonstrate that integrating hyperbolic geometry into discrete representation learning substantially enhances the ability to capture latent hierarchies.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12404v1
Personalized Author Obfuscation with Large Language Models,"In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in obfuscating authorship by paraphrasing and altering writing styles. Rather than adopting a holistic approach that evaluates performance across the entire dataset, we focus on user-wise performance to analyze how obfuscation effectiveness varies across individual authors. While LLMs are generally effective, we observe a bimodal distribution of efficacy, with performance varying significantly across users. To address this, we propose a personalized prompting method that outperforms standard prompting techniques and partially mitigates the bimodality issue.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12090v1
Fine-Grained ECG-Text Contrastive Learning via Waveform Understanding   Enhancement,"Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are essential for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. While previous ECG-text contrastive learning methods have shown promising results, they often overlook the incompleteness of the reports. Given an ECG, the report is generated by first identifying key waveform features and then inferring the final diagnosis through these features. Despite their importance, these waveform features are often not recorded in the report as intermediate results. Aligning ECGs with such incomplete reports impedes the model's ability to capture the ECG's waveform features and limits its understanding of diagnostic reasoning based on those features. To address this, we propose FG-CLEP (Fine-Grained Contrastive Language ECG Pre-training), which aims to recover these waveform features from incomplete reports with the help of large language models (LLMs), under the challenges of hallucinations and the non-bijective relationship between waveform features and diagnoses. Additionally, considering the frequent false negatives due to the prevalence of common diagnoses in ECGs, we introduce a semantic similarity matrix to guide contrastive learning. Furthermore, we adopt a sigmoid-based loss function to accommodate the multi-label nature of ECG-related tasks. Experiments on six datasets demonstrate that FG-CLEP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot prediction and linear probing across these datasets.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11939v1
Detection and Mitigation of Hallucination in Large Reasoning Models: A   Mechanistic Perspective,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in multi-step reasoning tasks. However, alongside these successes, a more deceptive form of model error has emerged--Reasoning Hallucination--where logically coherent but factually incorrect reasoning traces lead to persuasive yet faulty conclusions. Unlike traditional hallucinations, these errors are embedded within structured reasoning, making them more difficult to detect and potentially more harmful. In this work, we investigate reasoning hallucinations from a mechanistic perspective. We propose the Reasoning Score, which quantifies the depth of reasoning by measuring the divergence between logits obtained from projecting late layers of LRMs to the vocabulary space, effectively distinguishing shallow pattern-matching from genuine deep reasoning. Using this score, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the ReTruthQA dataset and identify two key reasoning hallucination patterns: early-stage fluctuation in reasoning depth and incorrect backtracking to flawed prior steps. These insights motivate our Reasoning Hallucination Detection (RHD) framework, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. To mitigate reasoning hallucinations, we further introduce GRPO-R, an enhanced reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates step-level deep reasoning rewards via potential-based shaping. Our theoretical analysis establishes stronger generalization guarantees, and experiments demonstrate improved reasoning quality and reduced hallucination rates.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12886v1
Nearest Neighbor Multivariate Time Series Forecasting,"Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting has a wide range of applications in both industry and academia. Recently, spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have gained popularity as MTS forecasting methods. However, current STGNNs can only use the finite length of MTS input data due to the computational complexity. Moreover, they lack the ability to identify similar patterns throughout the entire dataset and struggle with data that exhibit sparsely and discontinuously distributed correlations among variables over an extensive historical period, resulting in only marginal improvements. In this article, we introduce a simple yet effective k-nearest neighbor MTS forecasting ( kNN-MTS) framework, which forecasts with a nearest neighbor retrieval mechanism over a large datastore of cached series, using representations from the MTS model for similarity search. This approach requires no additional training and scales to give the MTS model direct access to the whole dataset at test time, resulting in a highly expressive model that consistently improves performance, and has the ability to extract sparse distributed but similar patterns spanning over multivariables from the entire dataset. Furthermore, a hybrid spatial-temporal encoder (HSTEncoder) is designed for kNN-MTS which can capture both long-term temporal and short-term spatial-temporal dependencies and is shown to provide accurate representation for kNN-MTSfor better forecasting. Experimental results on several real-world datasets show a significant improvement in the forecasting performance of kNN-MTS. The quantitative analysis also illustrates the interpretability and efficiency of kNN-MTS, showing better application prospects and opening up a new path for efficiently using the large dataset in MTS models.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11625v1
Web IP at Risk: Prevent Unauthorized Real-Time Retrieval by Large   Language Models,"Protecting cyber Intellectual Property (IP) such as web content is an increasingly critical concern. The rise of large language models (LLMs) with online retrieval capabilities presents a double-edged sword that enables convenient access to information but often undermines the rights of original content creators. As users increasingly rely on LLM-generated responses, they gradually diminish direct engagement with original information sources, significantly reducing the incentives for IP creators to contribute, and leading to a saturating cyberspace with more AI-generated content. In response, we propose a novel defense framework that empowers web content creators to safeguard their web-based IP from unauthorized LLM real-time extraction by leveraging the semantic understanding capability of LLMs themselves. Our method follows principled motivations and effectively addresses an intractable black-box optimization problem. Real-world experiments demonstrated that our methods improve defense success rates from 2.5% to 88.6% on different LLMs, outperforming traditional defenses such as configuration-based restrictions.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12655v1
Lightweight Transformer via Unrolling of Mixed Graph Algorithms for   Traffic Forecast,"To forecast traffic with both spatial and temporal dimensions, we unroll a mixed-graph-based optimization algorithm into a lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural net. Specifically, we construct two graphs: an undirected graph $\mathcal{G}^u$ capturing spatial correlations across geography, and a directed graph $\mathcal{G}^d$ capturing sequential relationships over time. We formulate a prediction problem for the future samples of signal $\mathbf{x}$, assuming it is ""smooth"" with respect to both $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, where we design new $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$-norm variational terms to quantify and promote signal smoothness (low-frequency reconstruction) on a directed graph. We construct an iterative algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and unroll it into a feed-forward network for data-driven parameter learning. We insert graph learning modules for $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, which are akin to the self-attention mechanism in classical transformers. Experiments show that our unrolled networks achieve competitive traffic forecast performance as state-of-the-art prediction schemes, while reducing parameter counts drastically. Our code is available in https://github.com/SingularityUndefined/Unrolling-GSP-STForecast.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13102v1
MatPredict: a dataset and benchmark for learning material properties of   diverse indoor objects,"Determining material properties from camera images can expand the ability to identify complex objects in indoor environments, which is valuable for consumer robotics applications. To support this, we introduce MatPredict, a dataset that combines the high-quality synthetic objects from Replica dataset with MatSynth dataset's material properties classes - to create objects with diverse material properties. We select 3D meshes of specific foreground objects and render them with different material properties. In total, we generate \textbf{18} commonly occurring objects with \textbf{14} different materials. We showcase how we provide variability in terms of lighting and camera placement for these objects. Next, we provide a benchmark for inferring material properties from visual images using these perturbed models in the scene, discussing the specific neural network models involved and their performance based on different image comparison metrics. By accurately simulating light interactions with different materials, we can enhance realism, which is crucial for training models effectively through large-scale simulations. This research aims to revolutionize perception in consumer robotics.

Just Dance with $π$! A Poly-modal Inductor for Weakly-supervised Video   Anomaly Detection,"Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced framework for VAD: ""PI-VAD"", a novel approach that augments RGB representations by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion (optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five modality backbones at inference.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13123v1
Fair-PP: A Synthetic Dataset for Aligning LLM with Personalized   Preferences of Social Equity,"Human preference plays a crucial role in the refinement of large language models (LLMs). However, collecting human preference feedback is costly and most existing datasets neglect the correlation between personalization and preferences. To address this issue, we introduce Fair-PP, a synthetic dataset of personalized preferences targeting social equity, derived from real-world social survey data, which includes 28 social groups, 98 equity topics, and 5 personal preference dimensions. Leveraging GPT-4o-mini, we engage in role-playing based on seven representative persona portrayals guided by existing social survey data, yielding a total of 238,623 preference records. Through Fair-PP, we also contribute (i) An automated framework for generating preference data, along with a more fine-grained dataset of personalized preferences; (ii) analysis of the positioning of the existing mainstream LLMs across five major global regions within the personalized preference space; and (iii) a sample reweighting method for personalized preference alignment, enabling alignment with a target persona while maximizing the divergence from other personas. Empirical experiments show our method outperforms the baselines.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11861v1
Redefining Neural Operators in $d+1$ Dimensions,"Neural Operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces. Among them, the kernel integral operator has been widely validated on universally approximating various operators. Although recent advancements following this definition have developed effective modules to better approximate the kernel function defined on the original domain (with $d$ dimensions, $d=1, 2, 3...$), the unclarified evolving mechanism in the embedding spaces blocks our view to design neural operators that can fully capture the target system evolution.   Drawing on recent breakthroughs in quantum simulation of partial differential equations (PDEs), we elucidate the linear evolution process in neural operators. Based on that, we redefine neural operators on a new $d+1$ dimensional domain. Within this framework, we implement our proposed Schr\""odingerised Kernel Neural Operator (SKNO) aligning better with the $d+1$ dimensional evolution. In experiments, our $d+1$ dimensional evolving linear block performs far better than others. Also, we test SKNO's SOTA performance on various benchmark tests and also the zero-shot super-resolution task. In addition, we analyse the impact of different lifting and recovering operators on the prediction within the redefined NO framework, reflecting the alignment between our model and the underlying $d+1$ dimensional evolution.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11766v1
Option-aware Temporally Abstracted Value for Offline Goal-Conditioned   Reinforcement Learning,"Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) offers a practical learning paradigm where goal-reaching policies are trained from abundant unlabeled (reward-free) datasets without additional environment interaction. However, offline GCRL still struggles with long-horizon tasks, even with recent advances that employ hierarchical policy structures, such as HIQL. By identifying the root cause of this challenge, we observe the following insights: First, performance bottlenecks mainly stem from the high-level policy's inability to generate appropriate subgoals. Second, when learning the high-level policy in the long-horizon regime, the sign of the advantage signal frequently becomes incorrect. Thus, we argue that improving the value function to produce a clear advantage signal for learning the high-level policy is essential. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution: Option-aware Temporally Abstracted value learning, dubbed OTA, which incorporates temporal abstraction into the temporal-difference learning process. By modifying the value update to be option-aware, the proposed learning scheme contracts the effective horizon length, enabling better advantage estimates even in long-horizon regimes. We experimentally show that the high-level policy extracted using the OTA value function achieves strong performance on complex tasks from OGBench, a recently proposed offline GCRL benchmark, including maze navigation and visual robotic manipulation environments.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12737v1
Anti-Inpainting: A Proactive Defense against Malicious Diffusion-based   Inpainters under Unknown Conditions,"As diffusion-based malicious image manipulation becomes increasingly prevalent, multiple proactive defense methods are developed to safeguard images against unauthorized tampering. However, most proactive defense methods only can safeguard images against manipulation under known conditions, and fail to protect images from manipulations guided by tampering conditions crafted by malicious users. To tackle this issue, we propose Anti-Inpainting, a proactive defense method that achieves adequate protection under unknown conditions through a triple mechanism to address this challenge. Specifically, a multi-level deep feature extractor is presented to obtain intricate features during the diffusion denoising process to improve protective effectiveness. We design multi-scale semantic-preserving data augmentation to enhance the transferability of adversarial perturbations across unknown conditions by multi-scale transformations while preserving semantic integrity. In addition, we propose a selection-based distribution deviation optimization strategy to improve the protection of adversarial perturbation against manipulation under diverse random seeds. Extensive experiments indicate the proactive defensive performance of Anti-Inpainting against diffusion-based inpainters guided by unknown conditions in InpaintGuardBench and CelebA-HQ. At the same time, we also demonstrate the proposed approach's robustness under various image purification methods and its transferability across different versions of diffusion models.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13023v1
Does Low Rank Adaptation Lead to Lower Robustness against Training-Time   Attacks?,"Low rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a prominent technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) thanks to its superb efficiency gains over previous methods. While extensive studies have examined the performance and structural properties of LoRA, its behavior upon training-time attacks remain underexplored, posing significant security risks. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the security implications of LoRA's low-rank structure during fine-tuning, in the context of its robustness against data poisoning and backdoor attacks. We propose an analytical framework that models LoRA's training dynamics, employs the neural tangent kernel to simplify the analysis of the training process, and applies information theory to establish connections between LoRA's low rank structure and its vulnerability against training-time attacks. Our analysis indicates that LoRA exhibits better robustness to backdoor attacks than full fine-tuning, while becomes more vulnerable to untargeted data poisoning due to its over-simplified information geometry. Extensive experimental evaluations have corroborated our theoretical findings.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12871v1
DMN-Guided Prompting: A Low-Code Framework for Controlling LLM Behavior,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown considerable potential in automating decision logic within knowledge-intensive processes. However, their effectiveness largely depends on the strategy and quality of prompting. Since decision logic is typically embedded in prompts, it becomes challenging for end users to modify or refine it. Decision Model and Notation (DMN) offers a standardized graphical approach for defining decision logic in a structured, user-friendly manner. This paper introduces a DMN-guided prompting framework that breaks down complex decision logic into smaller, manageable components, guiding LLMs through structured decision pathways. We implemented the framework in a graduate-level course where students submitted assignments. The assignments and DMN models representing feedback instructions served as inputs to our framework. The instructor evaluated the generated feedback and labeled it for performance assessment. Our approach demonstrated promising results, outperforming chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Students also responded positively to the generated feedback, reporting high levels of perceived usefulness in a survey based on the Technology Acceptance Model.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11701v1
Generative and Contrastive Graph Representation Learning,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) on graphs generates node and graph representations (i.e., embeddings) that can be used for downstream tasks such as node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. Graph SSL is particularly useful in scenarios with limited or no labeled data. Existing SSL methods predominantly follow contrastive or generative paradigms, each excelling in different tasks: contrastive methods typically perform well on classification tasks, while generative methods often excel in link prediction. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for graph SSL that integrates the strengths of both approaches. Our framework introduces community-aware node-level contrastive learning, providing more robust and effective positive and negative node pairs generation, alongside graph-level contrastive learning to capture global semantic information. Additionally, we employ a comprehensive augmentation strategy that combines feature masking, node perturbation, and edge perturbation, enabling robust and diverse representation learning. By incorporating these enhancements, our model achieves superior performance across multiple tasks, including node classification, clustering, and link prediction. Evaluations on open benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a performance lift of 0.23%-2.01% depending on the task and dataset.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11776v1
Keypoints as Dynamic Centroids for Unified Human Pose and Segmentation,"The dynamic movement of the human body presents a fundamental challenge for human pose estimation and body segmentation. State-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on combining keypoint heatmaps with segmentation masks but often struggle in scenarios involving overlapping joints or rapidly changing poses during instance-level segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose Keypoints as Dynamic Centroid (KDC), a new centroid-based representation for unified human pose estimation and instance-level segmentation. KDC adopts a bottom-up paradigm to generate keypoint heatmaps for both easily distinguishable and complex keypoints and improves keypoint detection and confidence scores by introducing KeyCentroids using a keypoint disk. It leverages high-confidence keypoints as dynamic centroids in the embedding space to generate MaskCentroids, allowing for swift clustering of pixels to specific human instances during rapid body movements in live environments. Our experimental evaluations on the CrowdPose, OCHuman, and COCO benchmarks demonstrate KDC's effectiveness and generalizability in challenging scenarios in terms of both accuracy and runtime performance. The implementation is available at: https://sites.google.com/view/niazahmad/projects/kdc.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12130v1
Emergence of Fixational and Saccadic Movements in a Multi-Level   Recurrent Attention Model for Vision,"Inspired by foveal vision, hard attention models promise interpretability and parameter economy. However, existing models like the Recurrent Model of Visual Attention (RAM) and Deep Recurrent Attention Model (DRAM) failed to model the hierarchy of human vision system, that compromise on the visual exploration dynamics. As a result, they tend to produce attention that are either overly fixational or excessively saccadic, diverging from human eye movement behavior. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level Recurrent Attention Model (MRAM), a novel hard attention framework that explicitly models the neural hierarchy of human visual processing. By decoupling the function of glimpse location generation and task execution in two recurrent layers, MRAM emergent a balanced behavior between fixation and saccadic movement. Our results show that MRAM not only achieves more human-like attention dynamics, but also consistently outperforms CNN, RAM and DRAM baselines on standard image classification benchmarks.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13191v1
Temporal Distance-aware Transition Augmentation for Offline Model-based   Reinforcement Learning,"The goal of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to extract a high-performance policy from the fixed datasets, minimizing performance degradation due to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Offline model-based RL (MBRL) is a promising approach that ameliorates OOD issues by enriching state-action transitions with augmentations synthesized via a learned dynamics model. Unfortunately, seminal offline MBRL methods often struggle in sparse-reward, long-horizon tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel MBRL framework, dubbed Temporal Distance-Aware Transition Augmentation (TempDATA), that generates augmented transitions in a temporally structured latent space rather than in raw state space. To model long-horizon behavior, TempDATA learns a latent abstraction that captures a temporal distance from both trajectory and transition levels of state space. Our experiments confirm that TempDATA outperforms previous offline MBRL methods and achieves matching or surpassing the performance of diffusion-based trajectory augmentation and goal-conditioned RL on the D4RL AntMaze, FrankaKitchen, CALVIN, and pixel-based FrankaKitchen.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13144v1
"Modèles de Substitution pour les Modèles à base d'Agents : Enjeux,   Méthodes et Applications","Multi-agent simulations enables the modeling and analyses of the dynamic behaviors and interactions of autonomous entities evolving in complex environments. Agent-based models (ABM) are widely used to study emergent phenomena arising from local interactions. However, their high computational cost poses a significant challenge, particularly for large-scale simulations requiring extensive parameter exploration, optimization, or uncertainty quantification. The increasing complexity of ABM limits their feasibility for real-time decision-making and large-scale scenario analysis. To address these limitations, surrogate models offer an efficient alternative by learning approximations from sparse simulation data. These models provide cheap-to-evaluate predictions, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy. Various machine learning techniques, including regression models, neural networks, random forests and Gaussian processes, have been applied to construct robust surrogates. Moreover, uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis play a crucial role in enhancing model reliability and interpretability.   This article explores the motivations, methods, and applications of surrogate modeling for ABM, emphasizing the trade-offs between accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Through a case study on a segregation model, we highlight the challenges associated with building and validating surrogate models, comparing different approaches and evaluating their performance. Finally, we discuss future perspectives on integrating surrogate models within ABM to improve scalability, explainability, and real-time decision support across various fields such as ecology, urban planning and economics.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11912v1
Exploiting Symbolic Heuristics for the Synthesis of Domain-Specific   Temporal Planning Guidance using Reinforcement Learning,"Recent work investigated the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the synthesis of heuristic guidance to improve the performance of temporal planners when a domain is fixed and a set of training problems (not plans) is given. The idea is to extract a heuristic from the value function of a particular (possibly infinite-state) MDP constructed over the training problems.   In this paper, we propose an evolution of this learning and planning framework that focuses on exploiting the information provided by symbolic heuristics during both the RL and planning phases. First, we formalize different reward schemata for the synthesis and use symbolic heuristics to mitigate the problems caused by the truncation of episodes needed to deal with the potentially infinite MDP. Second, we propose learning a residual of an existing symbolic heuristic, which is a ""correction"" of the heuristic value, instead of eagerly learning the whole heuristic from scratch. Finally, we use the learned heuristic in combination with a symbolic heuristic using a multiple-queue planning approach to balance systematic search with imperfect learned information. We experimentally compare all the approaches, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses and significantly advancing the state of the art for this planning and learning schema.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13372v1
Bullying the Machine: How Personas Increase LLM Vulnerability,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactions where they are prompted to adopt personas. This paper investigates whether such persona conditioning affects model safety under bullying, an adversarial manipulation that applies psychological pressures in order to force the victim to comply to the attacker. We introduce a simulation framework in which an attacker LLM engages a victim LLM using psychologically grounded bullying tactics, while the victim adopts personas aligned with the Big Five personality traits. Experiments using multiple open-source LLMs and a wide range of adversarial goals reveal that certain persona configurations -- such as weakened agreeableness or conscientiousness -- significantly increase victim's susceptibility to unsafe outputs. Bullying tactics involving emotional or sarcastic manipulation, such as gaslighting and ridicule, are particularly effective. These findings suggest that persona-driven interaction introduces a novel vector for safety risks in LLMs and highlight the need for persona-aware safety evaluation and alignment strategies.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12692v1
SepPrune: Structured Pruning for Efficient Deep Speech Separation,"Although deep learning has substantially advanced speech separation in recent years, most existing studies continue to prioritize separation quality while overlooking computational efficiency, an essential factor for low-latency speech processing in real-time applications. In this paper, we propose SepPrune, the first structured pruning framework specifically designed to compress deep speech separation models and reduce their computational cost. SepPrune begins by analyzing the computational structure of a given model to identify layers with the highest computational burden. It then introduces a differentiable masking strategy to enable gradient-driven channel selection. Based on the learned masks, SepPrune prunes redundant channels and fine-tunes the remaining parameters to recover performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this learnable pruning paradigm yields substantial advantages for channel pruning in speech separation models, outperforming existing methods. Notably, a model pruned with SepPrune can recover 85% of the performance of a pre-trained model (trained over hundreds of epochs) with only one epoch of fine-tuning, and achieves convergence 36$\times$ faster than training from scratch.

AGI-Elo: How Far Are We From Mastering A Task?,"As the field progresses toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), there is a pressing need for more comprehensive and insightful evaluation frameworks that go beyond aggregate performance metrics. This paper introduces a unified rating system that jointly models the difficulty of individual test cases and the competency of AI models (or humans) across vision, language, and action domains. Unlike existing metrics that focus solely on models, our approach allows for fine-grained, difficulty-aware evaluations through competitive interactions between models and tasks, capturing both the long-tail distribution of real-world challenges and the competency gap between current models and full task mastery. We validate the generalizability and robustness of our system through extensive experiments on multiple established datasets and models across distinct AGI domains. The resulting rating distributions offer novel perspectives and interpretable insights into task difficulty, model progression, and the outstanding challenges that remain on the path to achieving full AGI task mastery.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12844v1
The Tower of Babel Revisited: Multilingual Jailbreak Prompts on   Closed-Source Large Language Models,"Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread applications across various domains, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial prompt injections. While most existing research on jailbreak attacks and hallucination phenomena has focused primarily on open-source models, we investigate the frontier of closed-source LLMs under multilingual attack scenarios. We present a first-of-its-kind integrated adversarial framework that leverages diverse attack techniques to systematically evaluate frontier proprietary solutions, including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini-1.5-Pro, and Qwen-Max. Our evaluation spans six categories of security contents in both English and Chinese, generating 38,400 responses across 32 types of jailbreak attacks. Attack success rate (ASR) is utilized as the quantitative metric to assess performance from three dimensions: prompt design, model architecture, and language environment. Our findings suggest that Qwen-Max is the most vulnerable, while GPT-4o shows the strongest defense. Notably, prompts in Chinese consistently yield higher ASRs than their English counterparts, and our novel Two-Sides attack technique proves to be the most effective across all models. This work highlights a dire need for language-aware alignment and robust cross-lingual defenses in LLMs, and we hope it will inspire researchers, developers, and policymakers toward more robust and inclusive AI systems.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12287v1
NeuroGen: Neural Network Parameter Generation via Large Language Models,"Acquiring the parameters of neural networks (NNs) has been one of the most important problems in machine learning since the inception of NNs. Traditional approaches, such as backpropagation and forward-only optimization, acquire parameters via iterative data fitting to gradually optimize them. This paper aims to explore the feasibility of a new direction: acquiring NN parameters via large language model generation. We propose NeuroGen, a generalized and easy-to-implement two-stage approach for NN parameter generation conditioned on descriptions of the data, task, and network architecture. Stage one is Parameter Reference Knowledge Injection, where LLMs are pretrained on NN checkpoints to build foundational understanding of parameter space, whereas stage two is Context-Enhanced Instruction Tuning, enabling LLMs to adapt to specific tasks through enriched, task-aware prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that NeuroGen effectively generates usable NN parameters. Our findings highlight the feasibility of LLM-based NN parameter generation and suggest a promising new paradigm where LLMs and lightweight NNs can coexist synergistically",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12470v1
SplInterp: Improving our Understanding and Training of Sparse   Autoencoders,"Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have received considerable recent attention as tools for mechanistic interpretability, showing success at extracting interpretable features even from very large LLMs. However, this research has been largely empirical, and there have been recent doubts about the true utility of SAEs. In this work, we seek to enhance the theoretical understanding of SAEs, using the spline theory of deep learning. By situating SAEs in this framework: we discover that SAEs generalise ``$k$-means autoencoders'' to be piecewise affine, but sacrifice accuracy for interpretability vs. the optimal ``$k$-means-esque plus local principal component analysis (PCA)'' piecewise affine autoencoder. We characterise the underlying geometry of (TopK) SAEs using power diagrams. And we develop a novel proximal alternating method SGD (PAM-SGD) algorithm for training SAEs, with both solid theoretical foundations and promising empirical results in MNIST and LLM experiments, particularly in sample efficiency and (in the LLM setting) improved sparsity of codes.

CompeteSMoE -- Statistically Guaranteed Mixture of Experts Training via   Competition,"Sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) offers an appealing solution to scale up the model complexity beyond the mean of increasing the network's depth or width. However, we argue that effective SMoE training remains challenging because of the suboptimal routing process where experts that perform computation do not directly contribute to the routing process. In this work, we propose competition, a novel mechanism to route tokens to experts with the highest neural response. Theoretically, we show that the competition mechanism enjoys a better sample efficiency than the traditional softmax routing. Furthermore, we develop CompeteSMoE, a simple yet effective algorithm to train large language models by deploying a router to learn the competition policy, thus enjoying strong performances at a low training overhead. Our extensive empirical evaluations on both the visual instruction tuning and language pre-training tasks demonstrate the efficacy, robustness, and scalability of CompeteSMoE compared to state-of-the-art SMoE strategies. We have made the implementation available at: https://github.com/Fsoft-AIC/CompeteSMoE.

EvoGPT: Enhancing Test Suite Robustness via LLM-Based Generation and   Genetic Optimization,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for automated unit test generation. We introduce a hybrid framework called EvoGPT that integrates LLM-based test generation with evolutionary search techniques to create diverse, fault-revealing unit tests. Unit tests are initially generated with diverse temperature sampling to maximize behavioral and test suite diversity, followed by a generation-repair loop and coverage-guided assertion enhancement. The resulting test suites are evolved using genetic algorithms, guided by a fitness function prioritizing mutation score over traditional coverage metrics. This design emphasizes the primary objective of unit testing-fault detection. Evaluated on multiple open-source Java projects, EvoGPT achieves an average improvement of 10% in both code coverage and mutation score compared to LLMs and traditional search-based software testing baselines. These results demonstrate that combining LLM-driven diversity, targeted repair, and evolutionary optimization produces more effective and resilient test suites.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12424v1
Multi-View Wireless Sensing via Conditional Generative Learning:   Framework and Model Design,"In this paper, we incorporate physical knowledge into learning-based high-precision target sensing using the multi-view channel state information (CSI) between multiple base stations (BSs) and user equipment (UEs). Such kind of multi-view sensing problem can be naturally cast into a conditional generation framework. To this end, we design a bipartite neural network architecture, the first part of which uses an elaborately designed encoder to fuse the latent target features embedded in the multi-view CSI, and then the second uses them as conditioning inputs of a powerful generative model to guide the target's reconstruction. Specifically, the encoder is designed to capture the physical correlation between the CSI and the target, and also be adaptive to the numbers and positions of BS-UE pairs. Therein the view-specific nature of CSI is assimilated by introducing a spatial positional embedding scheme, which exploits the structure of electromagnetic(EM)-wave propagation channels. Finally, a conditional diffusion model with a weighted loss is employed to generate the target's point cloud from the fused features. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed generative multi-view (Gen-MV) sensing framework exhibits excellent flexibility and significant performance improvement on the reconstruction quality of target's shape and EM properties.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12664v1
ChatHTN: Interleaving Approximate (LLM) and Symbolic HTN Planning,"We introduce ChatHTN, a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planner that combines symbolic HTN planning techniques with queries to ChatGPT to approximate solutions in the form of task decompositions. The resulting hierarchies interleave task decompositions generated by symbolic HTN planning with those generated by ChatGPT.

LifelongAgentBench: Evaluating LLM Agents as Lifelong Learners,"Lifelong learning is essential for intelligent agents operating in dynamic environments. Current large language model (LLM)-based agents, however, remain stateless and unable to accumulate or transfer knowledge over time. Existing benchmarks treat agents as static systems and fail to evaluate lifelong learning capabilities. We present LifelongAgentBench, the first unified benchmark designed to systematically assess the lifelong learning ability of LLM agents. It provides skill-grounded, interdependent tasks across three interactive environments, Database, Operating System, and Knowledge Graph, with automatic label verification, reproducibility, and modular extensibility. Extensive experiments reveal that conventional experience replay has limited effectiveness for LLM agents due to irrelevant information and context length constraints. We further introduce a group self-consistency mechanism that significantly improves lifelong learning performance. We hope LifelongAgentBench will advance the development of adaptive, memory-capable LLM agents.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11942v1
Rethinking Reward Model Evaluation Through the Lens of Reward   Overoptimization,"Reward models (RMs) play a crucial role in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), aligning model behavior with human preferences. However, existing benchmarks for reward models show a weak correlation with the performance of optimized policies, suggesting that they fail to accurately assess the true capabilities of RMs. To bridge this gap, we explore several evaluation designs through the lens of reward overoptimization\textemdash a phenomenon that captures both how well the reward model aligns with human preferences and the dynamics of the learning signal it provides to the policy. The results highlight three key findings on how to construct a reliable benchmark: (i) it is important to minimize differences between chosen and rejected responses beyond correctness, (ii) evaluating reward models requires multiple comparisons across a wide range of chosen and rejected responses, and (iii) given that reward models encounter responses with diverse representations, responses should be sourced from a variety of models. However, we also observe that a extremely high correlation with degree of overoptimization leads to comparatively lower correlation with certain downstream performance. Thus, when designing a benchmark, it is desirable to use the degree of overoptimization as a useful tool, rather than the end goal.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12763v1
Emergent Specialization: Rare Token Neurons in Language Models,"Large language models struggle with representing and generating rare tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. In this study, we identify neuron structures with exceptionally strong influence on language model's prediction of rare tokens, termed as rare token neurons, and investigate the mechanism for their emergence and behavior. These neurons exhibit a characteristic three-phase organization (plateau, power-law, and rapid decay) that emerges dynamically during training, evolving from a homogeneous initial state to a functionally differentiated architecture. In the activation space, rare token neurons form a coordinated subnetwork that selectively co-activates while avoiding co-activation with other neurons. This functional specialization potentially correlates with the development of heavy-tailed weight distributions, suggesting a statistical mechanical basis for emergent specialization.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12822v1
Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant,"Video-based spatial cognition is vital for robotics and embodied AI but challenges current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce ViCA (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant)-322K, a diverse dataset of 322,003 QA pairs from real-world indoor videos (ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++), offering supervision for 3D metadata-grounded queries and video-based complex reasoning. Second, we develop ViCA-7B, fine-tuned on ViCA-322K, which achieves new state-of-the-art on all eight VSI-Bench tasks, outperforming existing models, including larger ones (e.g., +26.1 on Absolute Distance). For interpretability, we present ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial reasoning. Our work highlights the importance of targeted data and suggests paths for improved temporal-spatial modeling. We release all resources to foster research in robust visuospatial intelligence.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12312v1
Importance Sampling for Nonlinear Models,"While norm-based and leverage-score-based methods have been extensively studied for identifying ""important"" data points in linear models, analogous tools for nonlinear models remain significantly underdeveloped. By introducing the concept of the adjoint operator of a nonlinear map, we address this gap and generalize norm-based and leverage-score-based importance sampling to nonlinear settings. We demonstrate that sampling based on these generalized notions of norm and leverage scores provides approximation guarantees for the underlying nonlinear mapping, similar to linear subspace embeddings. As direct applications, these nonlinear scores not only reduce the computational complexity of training nonlinear models by enabling efficient sampling over large datasets but also offer a novel mechanism for model explainability and outlier detection. Our contributions are supported by both theoretical analyses and experimental results across a variety of supervised learning scenarios.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12353v1
From n-gram to Attention: How Model Architectures Learn and Propagate   Bias in Language Modeling,"Current research on bias in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on data quality, with significantly less attention paid to model architecture and temporal influences of data. Even more critically, few studies systematically investigate the origins of bias. We propose a methodology grounded in comparative behavioral theory to interpret the complex interaction between training data and model architecture in bias propagation during language modeling. Building on recent work that relates transformers to n-gram LMs, we evaluate how data, model design choices, and temporal dynamics affect bias propagation. Our findings reveal that: (1) n-gram LMs are highly sensitive to context window size in bias propagation, while transformers demonstrate architectural robustness; (2) the temporal provenance of training data significantly affects bias; and (3) different model architectures respond differentially to controlled bias injection, with certain biases (e.g. sexual orientation) being disproportionately amplified. As language models become ubiquitous, our findings highlight the need for a holistic approach -- tracing bias to its origins across both data and model dimensions, not just symptoms, to mitigate harm.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12381v1
The Traitors: Deception and Trust in Multi-Agent Language Model   Simulations,"As AI systems increasingly assume roles where trust and alignment with human values are essential, understanding when and why they engage in deception has become a critical research priority. We introduce The Traitors, a multi-agent simulation framework inspired by social deduction games, designed to probe deception, trust formation, and strategic communication among large language model (LLM) agents under asymmetric information. A minority of agents the traitors seek to mislead the majority, while the faithful must infer hidden identities through dialogue and reasoning. Our contributions are: (1) we ground the environment in formal frameworks from game theory, behavioral economics, and social cognition; (2) we develop a suite of evaluation metrics capturing deception success, trust dynamics, and collective inference quality; (3) we implement a fully autonomous simulation platform where LLMs reason over persistent memory and evolving social dynamics, with support for heterogeneous agent populations, specialized traits, and adaptive behaviors. Our initial experiments across DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o (10 runs per model) reveal a notable asymmetry: advanced models like GPT-4o demonstrate superior deceptive capabilities yet exhibit disproportionate vulnerability to others' falsehoods. This suggests deception skills may scale faster than detection abilities. Overall, The Traitors provides a focused, configurable testbed for investigating LLM behavior in socially nuanced interactions. We position this work as a contribution toward more rigorous research on deception mechanisms, alignment challenges, and the broader social reliability of AI systems.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12923v1
When the Left Foot Leads to the Right Path: Bridging Initial Prejudice   and Trainability,"Understanding the statistical properties of deep neural networks (DNNs) at initialization is crucial for elucidating both their trainability and the intrinsic architectural biases they encode prior to data exposure. Mean-field (MF) analyses have demonstrated that the parameter distribution in randomly initialized networks dictates whether gradients vanish or explode. Concurrently, untrained DNNs were found to exhibit an initial-guessing bias (IGB), in which large regions of the input space are assigned to a single class. In this work, we derive a theoretical proof establishing the correspondence between IGB and previous MF theories, thereby connecting a network prejudice toward specific classes with the conditions for fast and accurate learning. This connection yields the counter-intuitive conclusion: the initialization that optimizes trainability is necessarily biased, rather than neutral. Furthermore, we extend the MF/IGB framework to multi-node activation functions, offering practical guidelines for designing initialization schemes that ensure stable optimization in architectures employing max- and average-pooling layers.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12096v1
Addressing the Scarcity of Benchmarks for Graph XAI,"While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto model for learning from structured data, their decisional process remains opaque to the end user, undermining their deployment in safety-critical applications. In the case of graph classification, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques address this major issue by identifying sub-graph motifs that explain predictions. However, advancements in this field are hindered by a chronic scarcity of benchmark datasets with known ground-truth motifs to assess the explanations' quality. Current graph XAI benchmarks are limited to synthetic data or a handful of real-world tasks hand-curated by domain experts. In this paper, we propose a general method to automate the construction of XAI benchmarks for graph classification from real-world datasets. We provide both 15 ready-made benchmarks, as well as the code to generate more than 2000 additional XAI benchmarks with our method. As a use case, we employ our benchmarks to assess the effectiveness of some popular graph explainers.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12437v1
Step-wise Adaptive Integration of Supervised Fine-tuning and   Reinforcement Learning for Task-Specific LLMs,"Large language models (LLMs) excel at mathematical reasoning and logical problem-solving. The current popular training paradigms primarily use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the models' reasoning abilities. However, when using SFT or RL alone, there are respective challenges: SFT may suffer from overfitting, while RL is prone to mode collapse. The state-of-the-art methods have proposed hybrid training schemes. However, static switching faces challenges such as poor generalization across different tasks and high dependence on data quality. In response to these challenges, inspired by the curriculum learning-quiz mechanism in human reasoning cultivation, We propose SASR, a step-wise adaptive hybrid training framework that theoretically unifies SFT and RL and dynamically balances the two throughout optimization. SASR uses SFT for initial warm-up to establish basic reasoning skills, and then uses an adaptive dynamic adjustment algorithm based on gradient norm and divergence relative to the original distribution to seamlessly integrate SFT with the online RL method GRPO. By monitoring the training status of LLMs and adjusting the training process in sequence, SASR ensures a smooth transition between training schemes, maintaining core reasoning abilities while exploring different paths. Experimental results demonstrate that SASR outperforms SFT, RL, and static hybrid training methods.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13026v1
Single Image Reflection Removal via inter-layer Complementarity,"Although dual-stream architectures have achieved remarkable success in single image reflection removal, they fail to fully exploit inter-layer complementarity in their physical modeling and network design, which limits the quality of image separation. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose two targeted improvements to enhance dual-stream architectures: First, we introduce a novel inter-layer complementarity model where low-frequency components extracted from the residual layer interact with the transmission layer through dual-stream architecture to enhance inter-layer complementarity. Meanwhile, high-frequency components from the residual layer provide inverse modulation to both streams, improving the detail quality of the transmission layer. Second, we propose an efficient inter-layer complementarity attention mechanism which first cross-reorganizes dual streams at the channel level to obtain reorganized streams with inter-layer complementary structures, then performs attention computation on the reorganized streams to achieve better inter-layer separation, and finally restores the original stream structure for output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art separation quality on multiple public datasets while significantly reducing both computational cost and model complexity.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12641v1
AdaptMol: Adaptive Fusion from Sequence String to Topological Structure   for Few-shot Drug Discovery,"Accurate molecular property prediction (MPP) is a critical step in modern drug development. However, the scarcity of experimental validation data poses a significant challenge to AI-driven research paradigms. Under few-shot learning scenarios, the quality of molecular representations directly dictates the theoretical upper limit of model performance. We present AdaptMol, a prototypical network integrating Adaptive multimodal fusion for Molecular representation. This framework employs a dual-level attention mechanism to dynamically integrate global and local molecular features derived from two modalities: SMILES sequences and molecular graphs. (1) At the local level, structural features such as atomic interactions and substructures are extracted from molecular graphs, emphasizing fine-grained topological information; (2) At the global level, the SMILES sequence provides a holistic representation of the molecule. To validate the necessity of multimodal adaptive fusion, we propose an interpretable approach based on identifying molecular active substructures to demonstrate that multimodal adaptive fusion can efficiently represent molecules. Extensive experiments on three commonly used benchmarks under 5-shot and 10-shot settings demonstrate that AdaptMol achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases. The rationale-extracted method guides the fusion of two modalities and highlights the importance of both modalities.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11878v1
Bi-Level Policy Optimization with Nyström Hypergradients,"The dependency of the actor on the critic in actor-critic (AC) reinforcement learning means that AC can be characterized as a bilevel optimization (BLO) problem, also called a Stackelberg game. This characterization motivates two modifications to vanilla AC algorithms. First, the critic's update should be nested to learn a best response to the actor's policy. Second, the actor should update according to a hypergradient that takes changes in the critic's behavior into account. Computing this hypergradient involves finding an inverse Hessian vector product, a process that can be numerically unstable. We thus propose a new algorithm, Bilevel Policy Optimization with Nystr\""om Hypergradients (BLPO), which uses nesting to account for the nested structure of BLO, and leverages the Nystr\""om method to compute the hypergradient. Theoretically, we prove BLPO converges to (a point that satisfies the necessary conditions for) a local strong Stackelberg equilibrium in polynomial time with high probability, assuming a linear parametrization of the critic's objective. Empirically, we demonstrate that BLPO performs on par with or better than PPO on a variety of discrete and continuous control tasks.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11714v1
Dense Communication between Language Models,"As higher-level intelligence emerges from the combination of modular components with lower-level intelligence, many works combines Large Language Models (LLMs) for collective intelligence. Such combination is achieved by building communications among LLMs. While current systems primarily facilitate such communication through natural language, this paper proposes a novel paradigm of direct dense vector communication between LLMs. Our approach eliminates the unnecessary embedding and de-embedding steps when LLM interact with another, enabling more efficient information transfer, fully differentiable optimization pathways, and exploration of capabilities beyond human heuristics. We use such stripped LLMs as vertexes and optimizable seq2seq modules as edges to construct LMNet, with similar structure as MLPs. By utilizing smaller pre-trained LLMs as vertexes, we train a LMNet that achieves comparable performance with LLMs in similar size with only less than 0.1% training cost. This offers a new perspective on scaling for general intelligence rather than training a monolithic LLM from scratch. Besides, the proposed method can be used for other applications, like customizing LLM with limited data, showing its versatility.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12741v1
Bridging Generative and Discriminative Learning: Few-Shot Relation   Extraction via Two-Stage Knowledge-Guided Pre-training,"Few-Shot Relation Extraction (FSRE) remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated data and the limited generalization capabilities of existing models. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in FSRE through in-context learning (ICL), their general-purpose training objectives often result in suboptimal performance for task-specific relation extraction. To overcome these challenges, we propose TKRE (Two-Stage Knowledge-Guided Pre-training for Relation Extraction), a novel framework that synergistically integrates LLMs with traditional relation extraction models, bridging generative and discriminative learning paradigms. TKRE introduces two key innovations: (1) leveraging LLMs to generate explanation-driven knowledge and schema-constrained synthetic data, addressing the issue of data scarcity; and (2) a two-stage pre-training strategy combining Masked Span Language Modeling (MSLM) and Span-Level Contrastive Learning (SCL) to enhance relational reasoning and generalization. Together, these components enable TKRE to effectively tackle FSRE tasks. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of TKRE, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in FSRE and underscoring its potential for broader application in low-resource scenarios. \footnote{The code and data are released on https://github.com/UESTC-GQJ/TKRE.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12236v1
SEED-GRPO: Semantic Entropy Enhanced GRPO for Uncertainty-Aware Policy   Optimization,"Large language models (LLMs) exhibit varying levels of confidence across input prompts (questions): some lead to consistent, semantically similar answers, while others yield diverse or contradictory outputs. This variation reflects LLM's uncertainty about the input prompt, a signal of how confidently the model understands a given problem. However, vanilla Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) treats all prompts equally during policy updates, ignoring this important information about the model's knowledge boundaries. To address this limitation, we propose SEED-GRPO (Semantic Entropy EnhanceD GRPO), which explicitly measures LLMs' uncertainty of the input prompts semantic entropy. Semantic entropy measures the diversity of meaning in multiple generated answers given a prompt and uses this to modulate the magnitude of policy updates. This uncertainty-aware training mechanism enables dynamic adjustment of policy update magnitudes based on question uncertainty. It allows more conservative updates on high-uncertainty questions while maintaining the original learning signal on confident ones. Experimental results on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24 56.7, AMC 68.7, MATH 83.4, Minerva 34.2, and OlympiadBench 48.0) demonstrate that SEED-GRPO achieves new state-of-the-art performance in average accuracy, validating the effectiveness of uncertainty-aware policy optimization.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12346v1
GATES: Cost-aware Dynamic Workflow Scheduling via Graph Attention   Networks and Evolution Strategy,"Cost-aware Dynamic Workflow Scheduling (CADWS) is a key challenge in cloud computing, focusing on devising an effective scheduling policy to efficiently schedule dynamically arriving workflow tasks, represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG), to suitable virtual machines (VMs). Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely employed for automated scheduling policy design. However, the performance of DRL is heavily influenced by the design of the problem-tailored policy network and is highly sensitive to hyperparameters and the design of reward feedback. Considering the above-mentioned issues, this study proposes a novel DRL method combining Graph Attention Networks-based policy network and Evolution Strategy, referred to as GATES. The contributions of GATES are summarized as follows: (1) GATES can capture the impact of current task scheduling on subsequent tasks by learning the topological relationships between tasks in a DAG. (2) GATES can learn the importance of each VM to ready tasks, increasing the chance of selecting the optimal VM. (3) Utilizing Evolution Strategy's robustness, exploratory nature, and tolerance for delayed rewards, GATES achieves stable policy learning in CADWS. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GATES in CADWS, outperforming several state-of-the-art algorithms.

True Zero-Shot Inference of Dynamical Systems Preserving Long-Term   Statistics,"Complex, temporally evolving phenomena, from climate to brain activity, are governed by dynamical systems (DS). DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters and orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts, even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems, and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also for advancing the TS prediction field.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13192v1
SourceDetMamba: A Graph-aware State Space Model for Source Detection in   Sequential Hypergraphs,"Source detection on graphs has demonstrated high efficacy in identifying rumor origins. Despite advances in machine learning-based methods, many fail to capture intrinsic dynamics of rumor propagation. In this work, we present SourceDetMamba: A Graph-aware State Space Model for Source Detection in Sequential Hypergraphs, which harnesses the recent success of the state space model Mamba, known for its superior global modeling capabilities and computational efficiency, to address this challenge. Specifically, we first employ hypergraphs to model high-order interactions within social networks. Subsequently, temporal network snapshots generated during the propagation process are sequentially fed in reverse order into Mamba to infer underlying propagation dynamics. Finally, to empower the sequential model to effectively capture propagation patterns while integrating structural information, we propose a novel graph-aware state update mechanism, wherein the state of each node is propagated and refined by both temporal dependencies and topological context. Extensive evaluations on eight datasets demonstrate that SourceDetMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12910v1
The Logical Expressiveness of Temporal GNNs via Two-Dimensional Product   Logics,"In recent years, the expressive power of various neural architectures -- including graph neural networks (GNNs), transformers, and recurrent neural networks -- has been characterised using tools from logic and formal language theory. As the capabilities of basic architectures are becoming well understood, increasing attention is turning to models that combine multiple architectural paradigms. Among them particularly important, and challenging to analyse, are temporal extensions of GNNs, which integrate both spatial (graph-structure) and temporal (evolution over time) dimensions. In this paper, we initiate the study of logical characterisation of temporal GNNs by connecting them to two-dimensional product logics. We show that the expressive power of temporal GNNs depends on how graph and temporal components are combined. In particular, temporal GNNs that apply static GNNs recursively over time can capture all properties definable in the product logic of (past) propositional temporal logic PTL and the modal logic K. In contrast, architectures such as graph-and-time TGNNs and global TGNNs can only express restricted fragments of this logic, where the interaction between temporal and spatial operators is syntactically constrained. These results yield the first logical characterisations of temporal GNNs and establish new relative expressiveness results for temporal GNNs.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11930v1
"Sinusoidal Initialization, Time for a New Start","Initialization plays a critical role in Deep Neural Network training, directly influencing convergence, stability, and generalization. Common approaches such as Glorot and He initializations rely on randomness, which can produce uneven weight distributions across layer connections. In this paper, we introduce the Sinusoidal initialization, a novel deterministic method that employs sinusoidal functions to construct structured weight matrices expressly to improve the spread and balance of weights throughout the network while simultaneously fostering a more uniform, well-conditioned distribution of neuron activation states from the very first forward pass. Because Sinusoidal initialization begins with weights and activations that are already evenly and efficiently utilized, it delivers consistently faster convergence, greater training stability, and higher final accuracy across a wide range of models, including convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and large language models. On average, our experiments show an increase of 4.8 % in final validation accuracy and 20.9 % in convergence speed. By replacing randomness with structure, this initialization provides a stronger and more reliable foundation for Deep Learning systems.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12909v1
Optimizing Anytime Reasoning via Budget Relative Policy Optimization,"Scaling test-time compute is crucial for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically employ reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize a verifiable reward obtained at the end of reasoning traces. However, such methods optimize only the final performance under a large and fixed token budget, which hinders efficiency in both training and deployment. In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more effective credit assignment in RL optimization. We then optimize the thinking and summary policies in a decoupled manner to maximize the cumulative reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO), to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the learning process when reinforcing the thinking policy. Empirical results in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms GRPO across all thinking budgets under various prior distributions, enhancing both training and token efficiency.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13438v1
Programmable metasurfaces for future photonic artificial intelligence,"Photonic neural networks (PNNs), which share the inherent benefits of photonic systems, such as high parallelism and low power consumption, could challenge traditional digital neural networks in terms of energy efficiency, latency, and throughput. However, producing scalable photonic artificial intelligence (AI) solutions remains challenging. To make photonic AI models viable, the scalability problem needs to be solved. Large optical AI models implemented on PNNs are only commercially feasible if the advantages of optical computation outweigh the cost of their input-output overhead. In this Perspective, we discuss how field-programmable metasurface technology may become a key hardware ingredient in achieving scalable photonic AI accelerators and how it can compete with current digital electronic technologies. Programmability or reconfigurability is a pivotal component for PNN hardware, enabling in situ training and accommodating non-stationary use cases that require fine-tuning or transfer learning. Co-integration with electronics, 3D stacking, and large-scale manufacturing of metasurfaces would significantly improve PNN scalability and functionalities. Programmable metasurfaces could address some of the current challenges that PNNs face and enable next-generation photonic AI technology.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11659v1
"Predicting Turn-Taking and Backchannel in Human-Machine Conversations   Using Linguistic, Acoustic, and Visual Signals","This paper addresses the gap in predicting turn-taking and backchannel actions in human-machine conversations using multi-modal signals (linguistic, acoustic, and visual). To overcome the limitation of existing datasets, we propose an automatic data collection pipeline that allows us to collect and annotate over 210 hours of human conversation videos. From this, we construct a Multi-Modal Face-to-Face (MM-F2F) human conversation dataset, including over 1.5M words and corresponding turn-taking and backchannel annotations from approximately 20M frames. Additionally, we present an end-to-end framework that predicts the probability of turn-taking and backchannel actions from multi-modal signals. The proposed model emphasizes the interrelation between modalities and supports any combination of text, audio, and video inputs, making it adaptable to a variety of realistic scenarios. Our experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on turn-taking and backchannel prediction tasks, achieving a 10\% increase in F1-score on turn-taking and a 33\% increase on backchannel prediction. Our dataset and code are publicly available online to ease of subsequent research.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12654v1
Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with Graph Embedding and   Rotational Position Encoding for Traffic Forecasting,"Traffic forecasting is a key task in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems. Recent research on traffic forecasting has mainly focused on combining graph neural networks (GNNs) with other models. However, GNNs only consider short-range spatial information. In this study, we present a novel model termed LSTAN-GERPE (Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with Graph Embedding and Rotational Position Encoding). This model leverages both Temporal and Spatial Attention mechanisms to effectively capture long-range traffic dynamics. Additionally, the optimal frequency for rotational position encoding is determined through a grid search approach in both the spatial and temporal attention mechanisms. This systematic optimization enables the model to effectively capture complex traffic patterns. The model also enhances feature representation by incorporating geographical location maps into the spatio-temporal embeddings. Without extensive feature engineering, the proposed method in this paper achieves advanced accuracy on the real-world traffic forecasting datasets PeMS04 and PeMS08.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12136v1
From Assistants to Adversaries: Exploring the Security Risks of Mobile   LLM Agents,"The growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has led to a new paradigm in mobile computing--LLM-powered mobile AI agents--capable of decomposing and automating complex tasks directly on smartphones. However, the security implications of these agents remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of mobile LLM agents, encompassing three representative categories: System-level AI Agents developed by original equipment manufacturers (e.g., YOYO Assistant), Third-party Universal Agents (e.g., Zhipu AI AutoGLM), and Emerging Agent Frameworks (e.g., Alibaba Mobile Agent). We begin by analyzing the general workflow of mobile agents and identifying security threats across three core capability dimensions: language-based reasoning, GUI-based interaction, and system-level execution. Our analysis reveals 11 distinct attack surfaces, all rooted in the unique capabilities and interaction patterns of mobile LLM agents, and spanning their entire operational lifecycle. To investigate these threats in practice, we introduce AgentScan, a semi-automated security analysis framework that systematically evaluates mobile LLM agents across all 11 attack scenarios. Applying AgentScan to nine widely deployed agents, we uncover a concerning trend: every agent is vulnerable to targeted attacks. In the most severe cases, agents exhibit vulnerabilities across eight distinct attack vectors. These attacks can cause behavioral deviations, privacy leakage, or even full execution hijacking. Based on these findings, we propose a set of defensive design principles and practical recommendations for building secure mobile LLM agents. Our disclosures have received positive feedback from two major device vendors. Overall, this work highlights the urgent need for standardized security practices in the fast-evolving landscape of LLM-driven mobile automation.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12981v1
REMOR: Automated Peer Review Generation with LLM Reasoning and   Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning,"AI-based peer review systems tend to produce shallow and overpraising suggestions compared to human feedback. Here, we evaluate how well a reasoning LLM trained with multi-objective reinforcement learning (REMOR) can overcome these limitations. We start by designing a multi-aspect reward function that aligns with human evaluation of reviews. The aspects are related to the review itself (e.g., criticisms, novelty) and the relationship between the review and the manuscript (i.e., relevance). First, we perform supervised fine-tuning of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B using LoRA on PeerRT, a new dataset of high-quality top AI conference reviews enriched with reasoning traces. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train two models: REMOR-H (with the human-aligned reward) and REMOR-U (with a uniform reward). Interestingly, the human-aligned reward penalizes aspects typically associated with strong reviews, leading REMOR-U to produce qualitatively more substantive feedback. Our results show that REMOR-U and REMOR-H achieve more than twice the average rewards of human reviews, non-reasoning state-of-the-art agentic multi-modal AI review systems, and general commercial LLM baselines. We found that while the best AI and human reviews are comparable in quality, REMOR avoids the long tail of low-quality human reviews. We discuss how reasoning is key to achieving these improvements and release the Human-aligned Peer Review Reward (HPRR) function, the Peer Review Reasoning-enriched Traces (PeerRT) dataset, and the REMOR models, which we believe can help spur progress in the area.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11718v1
TIME: A Multi-level Benchmark for Temporal Reasoning of LLMs in   Real-World Scenarios,"Temporal reasoning is pivotal for Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend the real world. However, existing works neglect the real-world challenges for temporal reasoning: (1) intensive temporal information, (2) fast-changing event dynamics, and (3) complex temporal dependencies in social interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-level benchmark TIME, designed for temporal reasoning in real-world scenarios. TIME consists of 38,522 QA pairs, covering 3 levels with 11 fine-grained sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses 3 sub-datasets reflecting different real-world challenges: TIME-Wiki, TIME-News, and TIME-Dial. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning models and non-reasoning models. And we conducted an in-depth analysis of temporal reasoning performance across diverse real-world scenarios and tasks, and summarized the impact of test-time scaling on temporal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we release TIME-Lite, a human-annotated subset to foster future research and standardized evaluation in temporal reasoning.

Learning Probabilistic Temporal Logic Specifications for Stochastic   Systems,"There has been substantial progress in the inference of formal behavioural specifications from sample trajectories, for example, using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). However, these techniques cannot handle specifications that correctly characterise systems with stochastic behaviour, which occur commonly in reinforcement learning and formal verification. We consider the passive learning problem of inferring a Boolean combination of probabilistic LTL (PLTL) formulas from a set of Markov chains, classified as either positive or negative. We propose a novel learning algorithm that infers concise PLTL specifications, leveraging grammar-based enumeration, search heuristics, probabilistic model checking and Boolean set-cover procedures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in two use cases: learning from policies induced by RL algorithms and learning from variants of a probabilistic model. In both cases, our method automatically and efficiently extracts PLTL specifications that succinctly characterise the temporal differences between the policies or model variants.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12107v1
MMS-VPR: Multimodal Street-Level Visual Place Recognition Dataset and   Benchmark,"Existing visual place recognition (VPR) datasets predominantly rely on vehicle-mounted imagery, lack multimodal diversity and underrepresent dense, mixed-use street-level spaces, especially in non-Western urban contexts. To address these gaps, we introduce MMS-VPR, a large-scale multimodal dataset for street-level place recognition in complex, pedestrian-only environments. The dataset comprises 78,575 annotated images and 2,512 video clips captured across 207 locations in a ~70,800 $\mathrm{m}^2$ open-air commercial district in Chengdu, China. Each image is labeled with precise GPS coordinates, timestamp, and textual metadata, and covers varied lighting conditions, viewpoints, and timeframes. MMS-VPR follows a systematic and replicable data collection protocol with minimal device requirements, lowering the barrier for scalable dataset creation. Importantly, the dataset forms an inherent spatial graph with 125 edges, 81 nodes, and 1 subgraph, enabling structure-aware place recognition. We further define two application-specific subsets -- Dataset_Edges and Dataset_Points -- to support fine-grained and graph-based evaluation tasks. Extensive benchmarks using conventional VPR models, graph neural networks, and multimodal baselines show substantial improvements when leveraging multimodal and structural cues. MMS-VPR facilitates future research at the intersection of computer vision, geospatial understanding, and multimodal reasoning.

Unleashing Automated Congestion Control Customization in the Wild,"Congestion control (CC) crucially impacts user experience across Internet services like streaming, gaming, AR/VR, and connected cars. Traditionally, CC algorithm design seeks universal control rules that yield high performance across diverse application domains and networks. However, varying service needs and network conditions challenge this approach.

SNAPE-PM: Building and Utilizing Dynamic Partner Models for Adaptive   Explanation Generation,"Adapting to the addressee is crucial for successful explanations, yet poses significant challenges for dialogsystems. We adopt the approach of treating explanation generation as a non-stationary decision process, where the optimal strategy varies according to changing beliefs about the explainee and the interaction context. In this paper we address the questions of (1) how to track the interaction context and the relevant listener features in a formally defined computational partner model, and (2) how to utilize this model in the dynamically adjusted, rational decision process that determines the currently best explanation strategy. We propose a Bayesian inference-based approach to continuously update the partner model based on user feedback, and a non-stationary Markov Decision Process to adjust decision-making based on the partner model values. We evaluate an implementation of this framework with five simulated interlocutors, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting to different partners with constant and even changing feedback behavior. The results show high adaptivity with distinct explanation strategies emerging for different partners, highlighting the potential of our approach to improve explainable AI systems and dialogsystems in general.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13053v1
HARDMath2: A Benchmark for Applied Mathematics Built by Students as Part   of a Graduate Class,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in mathematical problem-solving, but evaluation has largely focused on problems that have exact analytical solutions or involve formal proofs, often overlooking approximation-based problems ubiquitous in applied science and engineering. To fill this gap, we build on prior work and present HARDMath2, a dataset of 211 original problems covering the core topics in an introductory graduate applied math class, including boundary-layer analysis, WKB methods, asymptotic solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations, and the asymptotics of oscillatory integrals. This dataset was designed and verified by the students and instructors of a core graduate applied mathematics course at Harvard. We build the dataset through a novel collaborative environment that challenges students to write and refine difficult problems consistent with the class syllabus, peer-validate solutions, test different models, and automatically check LLM-generated solutions against their own answers and numerical ground truths. Evaluation results show that leading frontier models still struggle with many of the problems in the dataset, highlighting a gap in the mathematical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Importantly, students identified strategies to create increasingly difficult problems by interacting with the models and exploiting common failure modes. This back-and-forth with the models not only resulted in a richer and more challenging benchmark but also led to qualitative improvements in the students' understanding of the course material, which is increasingly important as we enter an age where state-of-the-art language models can solve many challenging problems across a wide domain of fields.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11774v1
"Tiny QA Benchmark++: Ultra-Lightweight, Synthetic Multilingual Dataset   Generation & Smoke-Tests for Continuous LLM Evaluation","Tiny QA Benchmark++ (TQB++) presents an ultra-lightweight, multilingual smoke-test suite designed to give large-language-model (LLM) pipelines a unit-test style safety net dataset that runs in seconds with minimal cost. Born out of the tight feedback-loop demands building the Comet Opik prompt-optimization SDK, where waiting on heavyweight benchmarks breaks developer flow. TQB++ couples a 52-item English gold set (less than 20 kB) with a tiny synthetic-data generator pypi package built on provider-agnostic LiteLLM. The generator lets practitioners mint their own tiny packs in any language, domain, or difficulty, while ten ready-made packs already cover Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish. Every dataset ships with Croissant metadata and plug-and-play files for OpenAI-Evals, LangChain, and standard CI tools, so teams can drop deterministic micro-benchmarks directly into pull-request gates, prompt-engineering loops, and production dashboards without touching GPU budgets. A complete TQB++ run adds only a few seconds to pipeline latency yet reliably flags prompt-template errors, tokenizer drift, and fine-tuning side-effects long before full-scale suites like MMLU or BIG-Bench would finish configuring. The entire framework is released to accelerate continuous, resource-efficient quality assurance across the generative-AI ecosystem.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12058v1
ARIW-Framework: Adaptive Robust Iterative Watermarking Framework,"With the rapid rise of large models, copyright protection for generated image content has become a critical security challenge. Although deep learning watermarking techniques offer an effective solution for digital image copyright protection, they still face limitations in terms of visual quality, robustness and generalization. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive robust iterative watermarking framework (ARIW-Framework) that achieves high-quality watermarked images while maintaining exceptional robustness and generalization performance. Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach to optimize the encoder for generating robust residuals. The encoder incorporates noise layers and a decoder to compute robustness weights for residuals under various noise attacks. By employing a parallel optimization strategy, the framework enhances robustness against multiple types of noise attacks. Furthermore, we leverage image gradients to determine the embedding strength at each pixel location, significantly improving the visual quality of the watermarked images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior visual quality while exhibiting remarkable robustness and generalization against noise attacks.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13101v1
MT-CYP-Net: Multi-Task Network for Pixel-Level Crop Yield Prediction   Under Very Few Samples,"Accurate and fine-grained crop yield prediction plays a crucial role in advancing global agriculture. However, the accuracy of pixel-level yield estimation based on satellite remote sensing data has been constrained by the scarcity of ground truth data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called the Multi-Task Crop Yield Prediction Network (MT-CYP-Net). This framework introduces an effective multi-task feature-sharing strategy, where features extracted from a shared backbone network are simultaneously utilized by both crop yield prediction decoders and crop classification decoders with the ability to fuse information between them. This design allows MT-CYP-Net to be trained with extremely sparse crop yield point labels and crop type labels, while still generating detailed pixel-level crop yield maps. Concretely, we collected 1,859 yield point labels along with corresponding crop type labels and satellite images from eight farms in Heilongjiang Province, China, in 2023, covering soybean, maize, and rice crops, and constructed a sparse crop yield label dataset. MT-CYP-Net is compared with three classical machine learning and deep learning benchmark methods in this dataset. Experimental results not only indicate the superiority of MT-CYP-Net compared to previous methods on multiple types of crops but also demonstrate the potential of deep networks on precise pixel-level crop yield prediction, especially with limited data labels.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12069v1
Residual Feature Integration is Sufficient to Prevent Negative Transfer,"Transfer learning typically leverages representations learned from a source domain to improve performance on a target task. A common approach is to extract features from a pre-trained model and directly apply them for target prediction. However, this strategy is prone to negative transfer where the source representation fails to align with the target distribution. In this article, we propose Residual Feature Integration (REFINE), a simple yet effective method designed to mitigate negative transfer. Our approach combines a fixed source-side representation with a trainable target-side encoder and fits a shallow neural network on the resulting joint representation, which adapts to the target domain while preserving transferable knowledge from the source domain. Theoretically, we prove that REFINE is sufficient to prevent negative transfer under mild conditions, and derive the generalization bound demonstrating its theoretical benefit. Empirically, we show that REFINE consistently enhances performance across diverse application and data modalities including vision, text, and tabular data, and outperforms numerous alternative solutions. Our method is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and robust, making it a valuable addition to the existing transfer learning toolbox.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11771v1
AutoGEEval: A Multimodal and Automated Framework for Geospatial Code   Generation on GEE with Large Language Models,"Geospatial code generation is emerging as a key direction in the integration of artificial intelligence and geoscientific analysis. However, there remains a lack of standardized tools for automatic evaluation in this domain. To address this gap, we propose AutoGEEval, the first multimodal, unit-level automated evaluation framework for geospatial code generation tasks on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform powered by large language models (LLMs). Built upon the GEE Python API, AutoGEEval establishes a benchmark suite (AutoGEEval-Bench) comprising 1325 test cases that span 26 GEE data types. The framework integrates both question generation and answer verification components to enable an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline-from function invocation to execution validation. AutoGEEval supports multidimensional quantitative analysis of model outputs in terms of accuracy, resource consumption, execution efficiency, and error types. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art LLMs-including general-purpose, reasoning-augmented, code-centric, and geoscience-specialized models-revealing their performance characteristics and potential optimization pathways in GEE code generation. This work provides a unified protocol and foundational resource for the development and assessment of geospatial code generation models, advancing the frontier of automated natural language to domain-specific code translation.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12900v1
Model Discovery with Grammatical Evolution. An Experiment with Prime   Numbers,"Machine Learning produces efficient decision and prediction models based on input-output data only.

AFCL: Analytic Federated Continual Learning for Spatio-Temporal   Invariance of Non-IID Data,"Federated Continual Learning (FCL) enables distributed clients to collaboratively train a global model from online task streams in dynamic real-world scenarios. However, existing FCL methods face challenges of both spatial data heterogeneity among distributed clients and temporal data heterogeneity across online tasks. Such data heterogeneity significantly degrades the model performance with severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and past knowledge. In this paper, we identify that the root cause of this issue lies in the inherent vulnerability and sensitivity of gradients to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a gradient-free method, named Analytic Federated Continual Learning (AFCL), by deriving analytical (i.e., closed-form) solutions from frozen extracted features. In local training, our AFCL enables single-epoch learning with only a lightweight forward-propagation process for each client. In global aggregation, the server can recursively and efficiently update the global model with single-round aggregation. Theoretical analyses validate that our AFCL achieves spatio-temporal invariance of non-IID data. This ideal property implies that, regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across local clients and online tasks, the aggregated model of our AFCL remains invariant and identical to that of centralized joint learning. Extensive experiments show the consistent superiority of our AFCL over state-of-the-art baselines across various benchmark datasets and settings.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12245v1
Lightweight and Effective Preference Construction in PIBT for   Large-Scale Multi-Agent Pathfinding,"PIBT is a computationally lightweight algorithm that can be applied to a variety of multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems, generating the next collision-free locations of agents given another. Because of its simplicity and scalability, it is becoming a popular underlying scheme for recent large-scale MAPF methods involving several hundreds or thousands of agents. Vanilla PIBT makes agents behave greedily towards their assigned goals, while agents typically have multiple best actions, since the graph shortest path is not always unique. Consequently, tiebreaking about how to choose between these actions significantly affects resulting solutions. This paper studies two simple yet effective techniques for tiebreaking in PIBT, without compromising its computational advantage. The first technique allows an agent to intelligently dodge another, taking into account whether each action will hinder the progress of the next timestep. The second technique is to learn, through multiple PIBT runs, how an action causes regret in others and to use this information to minimise regret collectively. Our empirical results demonstrate that these techniques can reduce the solution cost of one-shot MAPF and improve the throughput of lifelong MAPF. For instance, in densely populated one-shot cases, the combined use of these tiebreaks achieves improvements of around 10-20% in sum-of-costs, without significantly compromising the speed of a PIBT-based planner.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12623v1
An Empirical Study of Many-to-Many Summarization with Large Language   Models,"Many-to-many summarization (M2MS) aims to process documents in any language and generate the corresponding summaries also in any language. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong multi-lingual abilities, giving them the potential to perform M2MS in real applications. This work presents a systematic empirical study on LLMs' M2MS ability. Specifically, we first reorganize M2MS data based on eight previous domain-specific datasets. The reorganized data contains 47.8K samples spanning five domains and six languages, which could be used to train and evaluate LLMs. Then, we benchmark 18 LLMs in a zero-shot manner and an instruction-tuning manner. Fine-tuned traditional models (e.g., mBART) are also conducted for comparisons. Our experiments reveal that, zero-shot LLMs achieve competitive results with fine-tuned traditional models. After instruct-tuning, open-source LLMs can significantly improve their M2MS ability, and outperform zero-shot LLMs (including GPT-4) in terms of automatic evaluations. In addition, we demonstrate that this task-specific improvement does not sacrifice the LLMs' general task-solving abilities. However, as revealed by our human evaluation, LLMs still face the factuality issue, and the instruction tuning might intensify the issue. Thus, how to control factual errors becomes the key when building LLM summarizers in real applications, and is worth noting in future research.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12983v1
Correspondence of high-dimensional emotion structures elicited by video   clips between humans and Multimodal LLMs,"Recent studies have revealed that human emotions exhibit a high-dimensional, complex structure. A full capturing of this complexity requires new approaches, as conventional models that disregard high dimensionality risk overlooking key nuances of human emotions. Here, we examined the extent to which the latest generation of rapidly evolving Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capture these high-dimensional, intricate emotion structures, including capabilities and limitations. Specifically, we compared self-reported emotion ratings from participants watching videos with model-generated estimates (e.g., Gemini or GPT). We evaluated performance not only at the individual video level but also from emotion structures that account for inter-video relationships. At the level of simple correlation between emotion structures, our results demonstrated strong similarity between human and model-inferred emotion structures. To further explore whether the similarity between humans and models is at the signle item level or the coarse-categorical level, we applied Gromov Wasserstein Optimal Transport. We found that although performance was not necessarily high at the strict, single-item level, performance across video categories that elicit similar emotions was substantial, indicating that the model could infer human emotional experiences at the category level. Our results suggest that current state-of-the-art MLLMs broadly capture the complex high-dimensional emotion structures at the category level, as well as their apparent limitations in accurately capturing entire structures at the single-item level.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12746v1
Table-R1: Region-based Reinforcement Learning for Table Understanding,"Tables present unique challenges for language models due to their structured row-column interactions, necessitating specialized approaches for effective comprehension. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in table reasoning through prompting and techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT), optimizing their performance for table question answering remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce region-based Table-R1, a novel reinforcement learning approach that enhances LLM table understanding by integrating region evidence into reasoning steps. Our method employs Region-Enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (RE-SFT) to guide models in identifying relevant table regions before generating answers, incorporating textual, symbolic, and program-based reasoning. Additionally, Table-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (TARPO) introduces a mixed reward system to dynamically balance region accuracy and answer correctness, with decaying region rewards and consistency penalties to align reasoning steps. Experiments show that Table-R1 achieves an average performance improvement of 14.36 points across multiple base models on three benchmark datasets, even outperforming baseline models with ten times the parameters, while TARPO reduces response token consumption by 67.5% compared to GRPO, significantly advancing LLM capabilities in efficient tabular reasoning.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12415v1
LLM-BABYBENCH: Understanding and Evaluating Grounded Planning and   Reasoning in LLMs,"Assessing the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan and reason within the constraints of interactive environments is crucial for developing capable AI agents. We introduce $\textbf{LLM-BabyBench}$, a new benchmark suite designed specifically for this purpose. Built upon a textual adaptation of the procedurally generated BabyAI grid world, this suite evaluates LLMs on three fundamental aspects of grounded intelligence: (1) predicting the consequences of actions on the environment state ($\textbf{Predict}$ task), (2) generating sequences of low-level actions to achieve specified objectives ($\textbf{Plan}$ task), and (3) decomposing high-level instructions into coherent subgoal sequences ($\textbf{Decompose}$ task). We detail the methodology for generating the three corresponding datasets ($\texttt{LLM-BabyBench-Predict}$, $\texttt{-Plan}$, $\texttt{-Decompose}$) by extracting structured information from an expert agent operating within the text-based environment. Furthermore, we provide a standardized evaluation harness and metrics, including environment interaction for validating generated plans, to facilitate reproducible assessment of diverse LLMs. Initial baseline results highlight the challenges posed by these grounded reasoning tasks. The benchmark suite, datasets, data generation code, and evaluation code are made publicly available ($\href{https://github.com/choukrani/llm-babybench}{\text{GitHub}}$, $\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/salem-mbzuai/LLM-BabyBench}{\text{HuggingFace}}$).",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12135v1
To Bias or Not to Bias: Detecting bias in News with bias-detector,"Media bias detection is a critical task in ensuring fair and balanced information dissemination, yet it remains challenging due to the subjectivity of bias and the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this work, we perform sentence-level bias classification by fine-tuning a RoBERTa-based model on the expert-annotated BABE dataset. Using McNemar's test and the 5x2 cross-validation paired t-test, we show statistically significant improvements in performance when comparing our model to a domain-adaptively pre-trained DA-RoBERTa baseline. Furthermore, attention-based analysis shows that our model avoids common pitfalls like oversensitivity to politically charged terms and instead attends more meaningfully to contextually relevant tokens. For a comprehensive examination of media bias, we present a pipeline that combines our model with an already-existing bias-type classifier. Our method exhibits good generalization and interpretability, despite being constrained by sentence-level analysis and dataset size because of a lack of larger and more advanced bias corpora. We talk about context-aware modeling, bias neutralization, and advanced bias type classification as potential future directions. Our findings contribute to building more robust, explainable, and socially responsible NLP systems for media bias detection.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13010v1
Structure-Aware Corpus Construction and User-Perception-Aligned Metrics   for Large-Language-Model Code Completion,"Code completion technology based on large language model has significantly improved the development efficiency of programmers. However, in practical applications, there remains a gap between current commonly used code completion evaluation metrics and users' actual perception. To address this issue, we propose two evaluation metrics for code completion tasks--LCP and ROUGE-LCP, from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Furthermore, to tackle the lack of effective structural semantic modeling and cross-module dependency information in LLMs for repository-level code completion scenarios, we propose a data processing method based on a Structure-Preserving and Semantically-Reordered Code Graph (SPSR-Graph). Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed evaluation metrics in terms of user perception consistency, as well as the effectiveness of the data processing method in enhancing model performance.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13073v1
Benchmarking Spatiotemporal Reasoning in LLMs and Reasoning Models:   Capabilities and Challenges,"Spatiotemporal reasoning plays a key role in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Despite advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), their capacity to reason about complex spatiotemporal signals remains underexplored. This paper proposes a hierarchical SpatioTemporal reAsoning benchmaRK, STARK, to systematically evaluate LLMs across three levels of reasoning complexity: state estimation (e.g., predicting field variables, localizing and tracking events in space and time), spatiotemporal reasoning over states (e.g., inferring spatial-temporal relationships), and world-knowledge-aware reasoning that integrates contextual and domain knowledge (e.g., intent prediction, landmark-aware navigation). We curate 26 distinct spatiotemporal tasks with diverse sensor modalities, comprising 14,552 challenges where models answer directly or by Python Code Interpreter. Evaluating 3 LRMs and 8 LLMs, we find LLMs achieve limited success in tasks requiring geometric reasoning (e.g., multilateration or triangulation), particularly as complexity increases. Surprisingly, LRMs show robust performance across tasks with various levels of difficulty, often competing or surpassing traditional first-principle-based methods. Our results show that in reasoning tasks requiring world knowledge, the performance gap between LLMs and LRMs narrows, with some LLMs even surpassing LRMs. However, the LRM o3 model continues to achieve leading performance across all evaluated tasks, a result attributed primarily to the larger size of the reasoning models. STARK motivates future innovations in model architectures and reasoning paradigms for intelligent CPS by providing a structured framework to identify limitations in the spatiotemporal reasoning of LLMs and LRMs.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11618v1
Diverging Towards Hallucination: Detection of Failures in   Vision-Language Models via Multi-token Aggregation,"Vision-language models (VLMs) now rival human performance on many multimodal tasks, yet they still hallucinate objects or generate unsafe text. Current hallucination detectors, e.g., single-token linear probing (SLP) and P(True), typically analyze only the logit of the first generated token or just its highest scoring component overlooking richer signals embedded within earlier token distributions. We demonstrate that analyzing the complete sequence of early logits potentially provides substantially more diagnostic information. We emphasize that hallucinations may only emerge after several tokens, as subtle inconsistencies accumulate over time. By analyzing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between logits corresponding to hallucinated and non-hallucinated tokens, we underscore the importance of incorporating later-token logits to more accurately capture the reliability dynamics of VLMs. In response, we introduce Multi-Token Reliability Estimation (MTRE), a lightweight, white-box method that aggregates logits from the first ten tokens using multi-token log-likelihood ratios and self-attention. Despite the challenges posed by large vocabulary sizes and long logit sequences, MTRE remains efficient and tractable. On MAD-Bench, MM-SafetyBench, MathVista, and four compositional-geometry benchmarks, MTRE improves AUROC by 9.4 +/- 1.3 points over SLP and by 12.1 +/- 1.7 points over P(True), setting a new state-of-the-art in hallucination detection for open-source VLMs.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11741v1
Role-Playing Evaluation for Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a notable capacity for adopting personas and engaging in role-playing.

To address this, we introduce Role-Playing Eval (RPEval), a novel benchmark designed to assess LLM role-playing capabilities across four key dimensions: emotional understanding, decision-making, moral alignment, and in-character consistency. This article details the construction of RPEval and presents baseline evaluations. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/yelboudouri/RPEval",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13157v1
On Membership Inference Attacks in Knowledge Distillation,"Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on huge datasets, some including sensitive information. This poses a serious privacy concern because privacy attacks such as Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) may detect this sensitive information. While knowledge distillation compresses LLMs into efficient, smaller student models, its impact on privacy remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate how knowledge distillation affects model robustness against MIA. We focus on two questions. First, how is private data protected in teacher and student models? Second, how can we strengthen privacy preservation against MIAs in knowledge distillation? Through comprehensive experiments, we show that while teacher and student models achieve similar overall MIA accuracy, teacher models better protect member data, the primary target of MIA, whereas student models better protect non-member data. To address this vulnerability in student models, we propose 5 privacy-preserving distillation methods and demonstrate that they successfully reduce student models' vulnerability to MIA, with ensembling further stabilizing the robustness, offering a reliable approach for distilling more secure and efficient student models. Our implementation source code is available at https://github.com/richardcui18/MIA_in_KD.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11837v1
Introduction to Analytical Software Engineering Design Paradigm,"As modern software systems expand in scale and complexity, the challenges associated with their modeling and formulation grow increasingly intricate. Traditional approaches often fall short in effectively addressing these complexities, particularly in tasks such as design pattern detection for maintenance and assessment, as well as code refactoring for optimization and long-term sustainability. This growing inadequacy underscores the need for a paradigm shift in how such challenges are approached and resolved. This paper presents Analytical Software Engineering (ASE), a novel design paradigm aimed at balancing abstraction, tool accessibility, compatibility, and scalability. ASE enables effective modeling and resolution of complex software engineering problems. The paradigm is evaluated through two frameworks Behavioral-Structural Sequences (BSS) and Optimized Design Refactoring (ODR), both developed in accordance with ASE principles. BSS offers a compact, language-agnostic representation of codebases to facilitate precise design pattern detection. ODR unifies artifact and solution representations to optimize code refactoring via heuristic algorithms while eliminating iterative computational overhead. By providing a structured approach to software design challenges, ASE lays the groundwork for future research in encoding and analyzing complex software metrics.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11979v1
Language Models That Walk the Talk: A Framework for Formal Fairness   Certificates,"As large language models become integral to high-stakes applications, ensuring their robustness and fairness is critical. Despite their success, large language models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations, such as synonym substitutions, can alter model predictions, posing risks in fairness-critical areas, such as gender bias mitigation, and safety-critical areas, such as toxicity detection. While formal verification has been explored for neural networks, its application to large language models remains limited. This work presents a holistic verification framework to certify the robustness of transformer-based language models, with a focus on ensuring gender fairness and consistent outputs across different gender-related terms. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to toxicity detection, offering formal guarantees that adversarially manipulated toxic inputs are consistently detected and appropriately censored, thereby ensuring the reliability of moderation systems. By formalizing robustness within the embedding space, this work strengthens the reliability of language models in ethical AI deployment and content moderation.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12767v1
DisCO: Reinforcing Large Reasoning Models with Discriminative   Constrained Optimization,"The recent success and openness of DeepSeek-R1 have brought widespread attention to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a reinforcement learning method for large reasoning models (LRMs). In this work, we analyze the GRPO objective under a binary reward setting and reveal an inherent limitation of question-level difficulty bias. We also identify a connection between GRPO and traditional discriminative methods in supervised learning. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a new Discriminative Constrained Optimization (DisCO) framework for reinforcing LRMs, grounded in the principle of discriminative learning. The main differences between DisCO and GRPO and its recent variants are: (1) it replaces the group relative objective with a discriminative objective defined by a scoring function; (2) it abandons clipping-based surrogates in favor of non-clipping RL surrogate objectives used as scoring functions; (3) it employs a simple yet effective constrained optimization approach to enforce the KL divergence constraint, ensuring stable training. As a result, DisCO offers notable advantages over GRPO and its variants: (i) it completely eliminates difficulty bias by adopting discriminative objectives; (ii) it addresses the entropy instability in GRPO and its variants through the use of non-clipping scoring functions and a constrained optimization approach; (iii) it allows the incorporation of advanced discriminative learning techniques to address data imbalance, where a significant number of questions have more negative than positive generated answers during training. Our experiments on enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of SFT-finetuned models show that DisCO significantly outperforms GRPO and its improved variants such as DAPO, achieving average gains of 7\% over GRPO and 6\% over DAPO across six benchmark tasks for an 1.5B model.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12366v1
Information Science Principles of Machine Learning: A Causal Chain   Meta-Framework Based on Formalized Information Mapping,"[Objective] This study focuses on addressing the current lack of a unified formal theoretical framework in machine learning, as well as the deficiencies in interpretability and ethical safety assurance. [Methods] A formal information model is first constructed, utilizing sets of well-formed formulas to explicitly define the ontological states and carrier mappings of typical components in machine learning. Learnable and processable predicates, along with learning and processing functions, are introduced to analyze the logical deduction and constraint rules of the causal chains within models. [Results] A meta-framework for machine learning theory (MLT-MF) is established. Based on this framework, universal definitions for model interpretability and ethical safety are proposed. Furthermore, three key theorems are proved: the equivalence of model interpretability and information recoverability, the assurance of ethical safety, and the estimation of generalization error. [Limitations] The current framework assumes ideal conditions with noiseless information-enabling mappings and primarily targets model learning and processing logic in static scenarios. It does not yet address information fusion and conflict resolution across ontological spaces in multimodal or multi-agent systems. [Conclusions] This work overcomes the limitations of fragmented research and provides a unified theoretical foundation for systematically addressing the critical challenges currently faced in machine learning.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13182v1
"KHRONOS: a Kernel-Based Neural Architecture for Rapid,   Resource-Efficient Scientific Computation","Contemporary models of high dimensional physical systems are constrained by the curse of dimensionality and a reliance on dense data. We introduce KHRONOS (Kernel Expansion Hierarchy for Reduced Order, Neural Optimized Surrogates), an AI framework for model based, model free and model inversion tasks. KHRONOS constructs continuously differentiable target fields with a hierarchical composition of per-dimension kernel expansions, which are tensorized into modes and then superposed. We evaluate KHRONOS on a canonical 2D, Poisson equation benchmark: across 16 to 512 degrees of freedom (DoFs), it obtained L2 square errors of 5e-4 down to 6e-10. This represents a 100 time gain over Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (which itself reports a 100 times improvement on MLPs/PINNs with 100 times fewer parameters) when controlling for the number of parameters. This also represents a 1e4 times improvement in L2 square error compared to standard linear FEM at comparable DoFs. Inference complexity is dominated by inner products, yielding sub-millisecond full-field predictions that scale to an arbitrary resolution. For inverse problems, KHRONOS facilitates rapid, iterative level set recovery in only a few forward evaluations, with sub-microsecond per sample latency. KHRONOS scalability, expressivity, and interpretability open new avenues in constrained edge computing, online control, computer vision, and beyond.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13315v1
Enhancing Large Language Models with Reward-guided Tree Search for   Knowledge Graph Question and Answering,"Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) tasks, which aim to find answers based on knowledge graphs (KGs) for natural language questions. Existing LLMs-based KGQA methods typically follow the Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) paradigm, which first retrieves reasoning paths from the large KGs, and then generates the answers based on them. However, these methods emphasize the exploration of new optimal reasoning paths in KGs while ignoring the exploitation of historical reasoning paths, which may lead to sub-optimal reasoning paths. Additionally, the complex semantics contained in questions may lead to the retrieval of inaccurate reasoning paths. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel and training-free framework for KGQA tasks called Reward-guided Tree Search on Graph (RTSoG). RTSoG decomposes an original question into a series of simpler and well-defined sub-questions to handle the complex semantics. Then, a Self-Critic Monte Carlo Tree Search (SC-MCTS) guided by a reward model is introduced to iteratively retrieve weighted reasoning paths as contextual knowledge. Finally, it stacks the weighted reasoning paths according to their weights to generate the final answers. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RTSoG. Notably, it achieves 8.7\% and 7.0\% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the GrailQA and the WebQSP respectively.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12476v1
Learning in Chaos: Efficient Autoscaling and Self-healing for   Distributed Training at the Edge,"Frequent node and link changes in edge AI clusters disrupt distributed training, while traditional checkpoint-based recovery and cloud-centric autoscaling are too slow for scale-out and ill-suited to chaotic and self-governed edge. This paper proposes Chaos, a resilient and scalable edge distributed training system with built-in self-healing and autoscaling. It speeds up scale-out by using multi-neighbor replication with fast shard scheduling, allowing a new node to pull the latest training state from nearby neighbors in parallel while balancing the traffic load between them. It also uses a cluster monitor to track resource and topology changes to assist scheduler decisions, and handles scaling events through peer negotiation protocols, enabling fully self-governed autoscaling without a central admin. Extensive experiments show that Chaos consistently achieves much lower scale-out delays than Pollux, EDL, and Autoscaling, and handles scale-in, connect-link, and disconnect-link events within 1 millisecond, making it smoother to handle node joins, exits, and failures. It also delivers the lowest idle time, showing superior resource use and scalability as the cluster grows.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12815v1
OZSpeech: One-step Zero-shot Speech Synthesis with   Learned-Prior-Conditioned Flow Matching,"Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have seen significant advancements in recent years, driven by improvements in deep learning and neural network architectures. Viewing the output speech as a data distribution, previous approaches often employ traditional speech representations, such as waveforms or spectrograms, within the Flow Matching framework. However, these methods have limitations, including overlooking various speech attributes and incurring high computational costs due to additional constraints introduced during training. To address these challenges, we introduce OZSpeech, the first TTS method to explore optimal transport conditional flow matching with one-step sampling and a learned prior as the condition, effectively disregarding preceding states and reducing the number of sampling steps. Our approach operates on disentangled, factorized components of speech in token format, enabling accurate modeling of each speech attribute, which enhances the TTS system's ability to precisely clone the prompt speech. Experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance over existing methods in content accuracy, naturalness, prosody generation, and speaker style preservation. Audio samples are available at our demo page https://ozspeech.github.io/OZSpeech_Web/.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12800v1
Observe-R1: Unlocking Reasoning Abilities of MLLMs with Dynamic   Progressive Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the specific challenges of adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we present Observe-R1, a novel framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We draw inspirations from human learning progression--from simple to complex and easy to difficult, and propose a gradual learning paradigm for MLLMs. To this end, we construct the NeuraLadder dataset, which is organized and sampled according to the difficulty and complexity of data samples for RL training. To tackle multimodal tasks, we introduce a multimodal format constraint that encourages careful observation of images, resulting in enhanced visual abilities and clearer and more structured responses. Additionally, we implement a bonus reward system that favors concise, correct answers within a length constraint, alongside a dynamic weighting mechanism that prioritizes uncertain and medium-difficulty problems, ensuring that more informative samples have a greater impact on training. Our experiments with the Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B models on 20k samples from the NeuraLadder dataset show that Observe-R1 outperforms a series of larger reasoning models on both reasoning and general benchmarks, achieving superior clarity and conciseness in reasoning chains. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our strategies, highlighting the robustness and generalization of our approach. The dataset and code will be released at https://github.com/zrguo/Observe-R1.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12432v1
Bootstrapping Diffusion: Diffusion Model Training Leveraging Partial and   Corrupted Data,"Training diffusion models requires large datasets. However, acquiring large volumes of high-quality data can be challenging, for example, collecting large numbers of high-resolution images and long videos. On the other hand, there are many complementary data that are usually considered corrupted or partial, such as low-resolution images and short videos. Other examples of corrupted data include videos that contain subtitles, watermarks, and logos. In this study, we investigate the theoretical problem of whether the above partial data can be utilized to train conventional diffusion models. Motivated by our theoretical analysis in this study, we propose a straightforward approach of training diffusion models utilizing partial data views, where we consider each form of complementary data as a view of conventional data. Our proposed approach first trains one separate diffusion model for each individual view, and then trains a model for predicting the residual score function. We prove generalization error bounds, which show that the proposed diffusion model training approach can achieve lower generalization errors if proper regularizations are adopted in the residual score function training. In particular, we prove that the difficulty in training the residual score function scales proportionally with the signal correlations not captured by partial data views. Consequently, the proposed approach achieves near first-order optimal data efficiency.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11825v1
An approach based on class activation maps for investigating the effects   of data augmentation on neural networks for image classification,"Neural networks have become increasingly popular in the last few years as an effective tool for the task of image classification due to the impressive performance they have achieved on this task. In image classification tasks, it is common to use data augmentation strategies to increase the robustness of trained networks to changes in the input images and to avoid overfitting. Although data augmentation is a widely adopted technique, the literature lacks a body of research analyzing the effects data augmentation methods have on the patterns learned by neural network models working on complex datasets. The primary objective of this work is to propose a methodology and set of metrics that may allow a quantitative approach to analyzing the effects of data augmentation in convolutional networks applied to image classification. An important tool used in the proposed approach lies in the concept of class activation maps for said models, which allow us to identify and measure the importance these models assign to each individual pixel in an image when executing the classification task. From these maps, we may then extract metrics over the similarities and differences between maps generated by these models trained on a given dataset with different data augmentation strategies. Experiments made using this methodology suggest that the effects of these data augmentation techniques not only can be analyzed in this way but also allow us to identify different impact profiles over the trained models.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12581v1
The power of text similarity in identifying AI-LLM paraphrased   documents: The case of BBC news articles and ChatGPT,"Generative AI paraphrased text can be used for copyright infringement and the AI paraphrased content can deprive substantial revenue from original content creators. Despite this recent surge of malicious use of generative AI, there are few academic publications that research this threat. In this article, we demonstrate the ability of pattern-based similarity detection for AI paraphrased news recognition. We propose an algorithmic scheme, which is not limited to detect whether an article is an AI paraphrase, but, more importantly, to identify that the source of infringement is the ChatGPT. The proposed method is tested with a benchmark dataset specifically created for this task that incorporates real articles from BBC, incorporating a total of 2,224 articles across five different news categories, as well as 2,224 paraphrased articles created with ChatGPT. Results show that our pattern similarity-based method, that makes no use of deep learning, can detect ChatGPT assisted paraphrased articles at percentages 96.23% for accuracy, 96.25% for precision, 96.21% for sensitivity, 96.25% for specificity and 96.23% for F1 score.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12405v1
Solve-Detect-Verify: Inference-Time Scaling with Flexible Generative   Verifier,"Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning for complex tasks inherently involves a trade-off between solution accuracy and computational efficiency. The subsequent step of verification, while intended to improve performance, further complicates this landscape by introducing its own challenging trade-off: sophisticated Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) can be computationally prohibitive if naively integrated with LLMs at test-time, while simpler, faster methods may lack reliability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce FlexiVe, a novel generative verifier that flexibly balances computational resources between rapid, reliable fast thinking and meticulous slow thinking using a Flexible Allocation of Verification Budget strategy. We further propose the Solve-Detect-Verify pipeline, an efficient inference-time scaling framework that intelligently integrates FlexiVe, proactively identifying solution completion points to trigger targeted verification and provide focused solver feedback. Experiments show FlexiVe achieves superior accuracy in pinpointing errors within reasoning traces on ProcessBench. Furthermore, on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and CNMO), our full approach outperforms baselines like self-consistency in reasoning accuracy and inference efficiency. Our system offers a scalable and effective solution to enhance LLM reasoning at test time.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11966v1
Token-Level Uncertainty Estimation for Large Language Model Reasoning,"While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, their output quality remains inconsistent across various application scenarios, making it difficult to identify trustworthy responses, especially in complex tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we propose a token-level uncertainty estimation framework to enable LLMs to self-assess and self-improve their generation quality in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we introduce low-rank random weight perturbation to LLM decoding, generating predictive distributions that we use to estimate token-level uncertainties. We then aggregate these uncertainties to reflect semantic uncertainty of the generated sequences. Experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets of varying difficulty demonstrate that our token-level uncertainty metrics strongly correlate with answer correctness and model robustness. Additionally, we explore using uncertainty to directly enhance the model's reasoning performance through multiple generations and the particle filtering algorithm. Our approach consistently outperforms existing uncertainty estimation methods, establishing effective uncertainty estimation as a valuable tool for both evaluating and improving reasoning generation in LLMs.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11737v1
Second SIGIR Workshop on Simulations for Information Access (Sim4IA   2025),"Simulations in information access (IA) have recently gained interest, as shown by various tutorials and workshops around that topic. Simulations can be key contributors to central IA research and evaluation questions, especially around interactive settings when real users are unavailable, or their participation is impossible due to ethical reasons. In addition, simulations in IA can help contribute to a better understanding of users, reduce complexity of evaluation experiments, and improve reproducibility. Building on recent developments in methods and toolkits, the second iteration of our Sim4IA workshop aims to again bring together researchers and practitioners to form an interactive and engaging forum for discussions on the future perspectives of the field. An additional aim is to plan an upcoming TREC/CLEF campaign.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11687v1
Towards Universal Semantics With Large Language Models,"The Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) is a linguistic theory based on a universal set of semantic primes: simple, primitive word-meanings that have been shown to exist in most, if not all, languages of the world. According to this framework, any word, regardless of complexity, can be paraphrased using these primes, revealing a clear and universally translatable meaning. These paraphrases, known as explications, can offer valuable applications for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but producing them has traditionally been a slow, manual process. In this work, we present the first study of using large language models (LLMs) to generate NSM explications. We introduce automatic evaluation methods, a tailored dataset for training and evaluation, and fine-tuned models for this task. Our 1B and 8B models outperform GPT-4o in producing accurate, cross-translatable explications, marking a significant step toward universal semantic representation with LLMs and opening up new possibilities for applications in semantic analysis, translation, and beyond.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11764v1
Malware families discovery via Open-Set Recognition on Android manifest   permissions,"Malware are malicious programs that are grouped into families based on their penetration technique, source code, and other characteristics. Classifying malware programs into their respective families is essential for building effective defenses against cyber threats. Machine learning models have a huge potential in malware detection on mobile devices, as malware families can be recognized by classifying permission data extracted from Android manifest files. Still, the malware classification task is challenging due to the high-dimensional nature of permission data and the limited availability of training samples. In particular, the steady emergence of new malware families makes it impossible to acquire a comprehensive training set covering all the malware classes. In this work, we present a malware classification system that, on top of classifying known malware, detects new ones. In particular, we combine an open-set recognition technique developed within the computer vision community, namely MaxLogit, with a tree-based Gradient Boosting classifier, which is particularly effective in classifying high-dimensional data. Our solution turns out to be very practical, as it can be seamlessly employed in a standard classification workflow, and efficient, as it adds minimal computational overhead. Experiments on public and proprietary datasets demonstrate the potential of our solution, which has been deployed in a business environment.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12750v1
ProMi: An Efficient Prototype-Mixture Baseline for Few-Shot Segmentation   with Bounding-Box Annotations,"In robotics applications, few-shot segmentation is crucial because it allows robots to perform complex tasks with minimal training data, facilitating their adaptation to diverse, real-world environments. However, pixel-level annotations of even small amount of images is highly time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we present a novel few-shot binary segmentation method based on bounding-box annotations instead of pixel-level labels. We introduce, ProMi, an efficient prototype-mixture-based method that treats the background class as a mixture of distributions. Our approach is simple, training-free, and effective, accommodating coarse annotations with ease. Compared to existing baselines, ProMi achieves the best results across different datasets with significant gains, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, we present qualitative experiments tailored to real-world mobile robot tasks, demonstrating the applicability of our approach in such scenarios.

LLM-based Automated Theorem Proving Hinges on Scalable Synthetic Data   Generation,"Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have sparked considerable interest in automated theorem proving and a prominent line of research integrates stepwise LLM-based provers into tree search. In this paper, we introduce a novel proof-state exploration approach for training data synthesis, designed to produce diverse tactics across a wide range of intermediate proof states, thereby facilitating effective one-shot fine-tuning of LLM as the policy model. We also propose an adaptive beam size strategy, which effectively takes advantage of our data synthesis method and achieves a trade-off between exploration and exploitation during tree search. Evaluations on the MiniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines under the stringent Pass@1 metric, attaining an average pass rate of $60.74\%$ on MiniF2F and $21.18\%$ on ProofNet. These results underscore the impact of large-scale synthetic data in advancing automated theorem proving.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12031v1
OT Score: An OT based Confidence Score for Unsupervised Domain   Adaptation,"We address the computational and theoretical limitations of existing distributional alignment methods for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), particularly regarding the estimation of classification performance and confidence without target labels. Current theoretical frameworks for these methods often yield computationally intractable quantities and fail to adequately reflect the properties of the alignment algorithms employed. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Optimal Transport (OT) score, a confidence metric derived from a novel theoretical analysis that exploits the flexibility of decision boundaries induced by Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport alignment. The proposed OT score is intuitively interpretable, theoretically rigorous, and computationally efficient. It provides principled uncertainty estimates for any given set of target pseudo-labels without requiring model retraining, and can flexibly adapt to varying degrees of available source information. Experimental results on standard UDA benchmarks demonstrate that classification accuracy consistently improves by identifying and removing low-confidence predictions, and that OT score significantly outperforms existing confidence metrics across diverse adaptation scenarios.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11669v1
SoftPQ: Robust Instance Segmentation Evaluation via Soft Matching and   Tunable Thresholds,"Segmentation evaluation metrics traditionally rely on binary decision logic: predictions are either correct or incorrect, based on rigid IoU thresholds. Detection--based metrics such as F1 and mAP determine correctness at the object level using fixed overlap cutoffs, while overlap--based metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice operate at the pixel level, often overlooking instance--level structure. Panoptic Quality (PQ) attempts to unify detection and segmentation assessment, but it remains dependent on hard-threshold matching--treating predictions below the threshold as entirely incorrect. This binary framing obscures important distinctions between qualitatively different errors and fails to reward gradual model improvements. We propose SoftPQ, a flexible and interpretable instance segmentation metric that redefines evaluation as a graded continuum rather than a binary classification. SoftPQ introduces tunable upper and lower IoU thresholds to define a partial matching region and applies a sublinear penalty function to ambiguous or fragmented predictions. These extensions allow SoftPQ to exhibit smoother score behavior, greater robustness to structural segmentation errors, and more informative feedback for model development and evaluation. Through controlled perturbation experiments, we show that SoftPQ captures meaningful differences in segmentation quality that existing metrics overlook, making it a practical and principled alternative for both benchmarking and iterative model refinement.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12155v1
AoP-SAM: Automation of Prompts for Efficient Segmentation,"The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a powerful foundation model for image segmentation, showing robust zero-shot generalization through prompt engineering. However, relying on manual prompts is impractical for real-world applications, particularly in scenarios where rapid prompt provision and resource efficiency are crucial. In this paper, we propose the Automation of Prompts for SAM (AoP-SAM), a novel approach that learns to generate essential prompts in optimal locations automatically. AoP-SAM enhances SAM's efficiency and usability by eliminating manual input, making it better suited for real-world tasks. Our approach employs a lightweight yet efficient Prompt Predictor model that detects key entities across images and identifies the optimal regions for placing prompt candidates. This method leverages SAM's image embeddings, preserving its zero-shot generalization capabilities without requiring fine-tuning. Additionally, we introduce a test-time instance-level Adaptive Sampling and Filtering mechanism that generates prompts in a coarse-to-fine manner. This notably enhances both prompt and mask generation efficiency by reducing computational overhead and minimizing redundant mask refinements. Evaluations of three datasets demonstrate that AoP-SAM substantially improves both prompt generation efficiency and mask generation accuracy, making SAM more effective for automated segmentation tasks.",AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11980v1
Enhancing the Dynamic Range of Quantum Sensing via Quantum Circuit   Learning,"Quantum metrology is a promising application of quantum technologies, enabling the precise measurement of weak external fields at a local scale. In typical quantum sensing protocols, a qubit interacts with an external field, and the amplitude of the field is estimated by analyzing the expectation value of a measured observable. Sensitivity can, in principle, be enhanced by increasing the number of qubits within a fixed volume, thereby maintaining spatial resolution. However, at high qubit densities, inter-qubit interactions induce complex many-body dynamics, resulting in multiple oscillations in the expectation value of the observable even for small field amplitudes. This ambiguity reduces the dynamic range of the sensing protocol. We propose a method to overcome the limitation in quantum metrology by adopting a quantum circuit learning framework using a parameterized quantum circuit to approximate a target function by optimizing the circuit parameters. In our method, after the qubits interact with the external field, we apply a sequence of parameterized quantum gates and measure a suitable observable. By optimizing the gate parameters, the expectation value is trained to exhibit a monotonic response within a target range of field amplitudes, thereby eliminating multiple oscillations and enhancing the dynamic range. This method offers a strategy for improving quantum sensing performance in dense qubit systems.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04958v1
Contextures: Representations from Contexts,"Despite the empirical success of foundation models, we do not have a systematic characterization of the representations that these models learn. In this paper, we establish the contexture theory. It shows that a large class of representation learning methods can be characterized as learning from the association between the input and a context variable. Specifically, we show that many popular methods aim to approximate the top-d singular functions of the expectation operator induced by the context, in which case we say that the representation learns the contexture. We demonstrate the generality of the contexture theory by proving that representation learning within various learning paradigms -- supervised, self-supervised, and manifold learning -- can all be studied from such a perspective. We also prove that the representations that learn the contexture are optimal on those tasks that are compatible with the context. One important implication of the contexture theory is that once the model is large enough to approximate the top singular functions, further scaling up the model size yields diminishing returns. Therefore, scaling is not all we need, and further improvement requires better contexts. To this end, we study how to evaluate the usefulness of a context without knowing the downstream tasks. We propose a metric and show by experiments that it correlates well with the actual performance of the encoder on many real datasets.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01557v1
FlashBias: Fast Computation of Attention with Bias,"Attention mechanism has emerged as a foundation module of modern deep learning models and has also empowered many milestones in various domains. Moreover, FlashAttention with IO-aware speedup resolves the efficiency issue of standard attention, further promoting its practicality. Beyond canonical attention, attention with bias also widely exists, such as relative position bias in vision and language models and pair representation bias in AlphaFold. In these works, prior knowledge is introduced as an additive bias term of attention weights to guide the learning process, which has been proven essential for model performance. Surprisingly, despite the common usage of attention with bias, its targeted efficiency optimization is still absent, which seriously hinders its wide applications in complex tasks. Diving into the computation of FlashAttention, we prove that its optimal efficiency is determined by the rank of the attention weight matrix. Inspired by this theoretical result, this paper presents FlashBias based on the low-rank compressed sensing theory, which can provide fast-exact computation for many widely used attention biases and a fast-accurate approximation for biases in general formalization. FlashBias can fully take advantage of the extremely optimized matrix multiplication operation in modern GPUs, achieving 1.5$\times$ speedup for AlphaFold, and over 2$\times$ speedup for attention with bias in vision and language models without loss of accuracy.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12044v1
EgoDex: Learning Dexterous Manipulation from Large-Scale Egocentric   Video,"Imitation learning for manipulation has a well-known data scarcity problem. Unlike natural language and 2D computer vision, there is no Internet-scale corpus of data for dexterous manipulation. One appealing option is egocentric human video, a passively scalable data source. However, existing large-scale datasets such as Ego4D do not have native hand pose annotations and do not focus on object manipulation. To this end, we use Apple Vision Pro to collect EgoDex: the largest and most diverse dataset of dexterous human manipulation to date. EgoDex has 829 hours of egocentric video with paired 3D hand and finger tracking data collected at the time of recording, where multiple calibrated cameras and on-device SLAM can be used to precisely track the pose of every joint of each hand. The dataset covers a wide range of diverse manipulation behaviors with everyday household objects in 194 different tabletop tasks ranging from tying shoelaces to folding laundry. Furthermore, we train and systematically evaluate imitation learning policies for hand trajectory prediction on the dataset, introducing metrics and benchmarks for measuring progress in this increasingly important area. By releasing this large-scale dataset, we hope to push the frontier of robotics, computer vision, and foundation models.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11709v1
Federated One-Shot Learning with Data Privacy and Objective-Hiding,"Privacy in federated learning is crucial, encompassing two key aspects: safeguarding the privacy of clients' data and maintaining the privacy of the federator's objective from the clients. While the first aspect has been extensively studied, the second has received much less attention.   We present a novel approach that addresses both concerns simultaneously, drawing inspiration from techniques in knowledge distillation and private information retrieval to provide strong information-theoretic privacy guarantees.   Traditional private function computation methods could be used here; however, they are typically limited to linear or polynomial functions. To overcome these constraints, our approach unfolds in three stages. In stage 0, clients perform the necessary computations locally. In stage 1, these results are shared among the clients, and in stage 2, the federator retrieves its desired objective without compromising the privacy of the clients' data. The crux of the method is a carefully designed protocol that combines secret-sharing-based multi-party computation and a graph-based private information retrieval scheme. We show that our method outperforms existing tools from the literature when properly adapted to this setting.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21182v1
Never Skip a Batch: Continuous Training of Temporal GNNs via Adaptive   Pseudo-Supervision,"Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs), while being accurate, face significant training inefficiencies due to irregular supervision signals in dynamic graphs, which induce sparse gradient updates. We first theoretically establish that aggregating historical node interactions into pseudo-labels reduces gradient variance, accelerating convergence. Building on this analysis, we propose History-Averaged Labels (HAL), a method that dynamically enriches training batches with pseudo-targets derived from historical label distributions. HAL ensures continuous parameter updates without architectural modifications by converting idle computation into productive learning steps. Experiments on the Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB) validate our findings and an assumption about slow change of user preferences: HAL accelerates TGNv2 training by up to 15x while maintaining competitive performance. Thus, this work offers an efficient, lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and theoretically motivated solution to label sparsity in temporal graph learning.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12526v1
Integrative Analysis and Imputation of Multiple Data Streams via Deep   Gaussian Processes,"Healthcare data, particularly in critical care settings, presents three key challenges for analysis. First, physiological measurements come from different sources but are inherently related. Yet, traditional methods often treat each measurement type independently, losing valuable information about their relationships. Second, clinical measurements are collected at irregular intervals, and these sampling times can carry clinical meaning. Finally, the prevalence of missing values. Whilst several imputation methods exist to tackle this common problem, they often fail to address the temporal nature of the data or provide estimates of uncertainty in their predictions. We propose using deep Gaussian process emulation with stochastic imputation, a methodology initially conceived to deal with computationally expensive models and uncertainty quantification, to solve the problem of handling missing values that naturally occur in critical care data. This method leverages longitudinal and cross-sectional information and provides uncertainty estimation for the imputed values. Our evaluation of a clinical dataset shows that the proposed method performs better than conventional methods, such as multiple imputations with chained equations (MICE), last-known value imputation, and individually fitted Gaussian Processes (GPs).",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12076v1
Enhancing Latent Computation in Transformers with Latent Tokens,"Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with auxiliary tokens has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing model performance. In this work, we introduce a lightweight method termed latent tokens; these are dummy tokens that may be non-interpretable in natural language but steer the autoregressive decoding process of a Transformer-based LLM via the attention mechanism. The proposed latent tokens can be seamlessly integrated with a pre-trained Transformer, trained in a parameter-efficient manner, and applied flexibly at inference time, while adding minimal complexity overhead to the existing infrastructure of standard Transformers. We propose several hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms of latent tokens and design synthetic tasks accordingly to verify them. Numerical results confirm that the proposed method noticeably outperforms the baselines, particularly in the out-of-distribution generalization scenarios, highlighting its potential in improving the adaptability of LLMs.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12629v1
TransferTraj: A Vehicle Trajectory Learning Model for Region and Task   Transferability,"Vehicle GPS trajectories provide valuable movement information that supports various downstream tasks and applications. A desirable trajectory learning model should be able to transfer across regions and tasks without retraining, avoiding the need to maintain multiple specialized models and subpar performance with limited training data. However, each region has its unique spatial features and contexts, which are reflected in vehicle movement patterns and difficult to generalize. Additionally, transferring across different tasks faces technical challenges due to the varying input-output structures required for each task. Existing efforts towards transferability primarily involve learning embedding vectors for trajectories, which perform poorly in region transfer and require retraining of prediction modules for task transfer.   To address these challenges, we propose TransferTraj, a vehicle GPS trajectory learning model that excels in both region and task transferability. For region transferability, we introduce RTTE as the main learnable module within TransferTraj. It integrates spatial, temporal, POI, and road network modalities of trajectories to effectively manage variations in spatial context distribution across regions. It also introduces a TRIE module for incorporating relative information of spatial features and a spatial context MoE module for handling movement patterns in diverse contexts. For task transferability, we propose a task-transferable input-output scheme that unifies the input-output structure of different tasks into the masking and recovery of modalities and trajectory points. This approach allows TransferTraj to be pre-trained once and transferred to different tasks without retraining. Extensive experiments on three real-world vehicle trajectory datasets under task transfer, zero-shot, and few-shot region transfer, validating TransferTraj's effectiveness.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12672v1
Scaling Laws and Representation Learning in Simple Hierarchical   Languages: Transformers vs. Convolutional Architectures,"How do neural language models acquire a language's structure when trained for next-token prediction? We address this question by deriving theoretical scaling laws for neural network performance on synthetic datasets generated by the Random Hierarchy Model (RHM) -- an ensemble of probabilistic context-free grammars designed to capture the hierarchical structure of natural language while remaining analytically tractable. Previously, we developed a theory of representation learning based on data correlations that explains how deep learning models capture the hierarchical structure of the data sequentially, one layer at a time. Here, we extend our theoretical framework to account for architectural differences. In particular, we predict and empirically validate that convolutional networks, whose structure aligns with that of the generative process through locality and weight sharing, enjoy a faster scaling of performance compared to transformer models, which rely on global self-attention mechanisms. This finding clarifies the architectural biases underlying neural scaling laws and highlights how representation learning is shaped by the interaction between model architecture and the statistical properties of data.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07070v1
Metric Graph Kernels via the Tropical Torelli Map,"We propose new graph kernels grounded in the study of metric graphs via tropical algebraic geometry. In contrast to conventional graph kernels that are based on graph combinatorics such as nodes, edges, and subgraphs, our graph kernels are purely based on the geometry and topology of the underlying metric space. A key characterizing property of our construction is its invariance under edge subdivision, making the kernels intrinsically well-suited for comparing graphs that represent different underlying spaces. We develop efficient algorithms for computing these kernels and analyze their complexity, showing that it depends primarily on the genus of the input graphs. Empirically, our kernels outperform existing methods in label-free settings, as demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. We further highlight their practical utility through an urban road network classification task.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12129v1
Improving Random Forests by Smoothing,"Gaussian process regression is a popular model in the small data regime due to its sound uncertainty quantification and the exploitation of the smoothness of the regression function that is encountered in a wide range of practical problems. However, Gaussian processes perform sub-optimally when the degree of smoothness is non-homogeneous across the input domain. Random forest regression partially addresses this issue by providing local basis functions of variable support set sizes that are chosen in a data-driven way. However, they do so at the expense of forgoing any degree of smoothness, which often results in poor performance in the small data regime. Here, we aim to combine the advantages of both models by applying a kernel-based smoothing mechanism to a learned random forest or any other piecewise constant prediction function. As we demonstrate empirically, the resulting model consistently improves the predictive performance of the underlying random forests and, in almost all test cases, also improves the log loss of the usual uncertainty quantification based on inter-tree variance. The latter advantage can be attributed to the ability of the smoothing model to take into account the uncertainty over the exact tree-splitting locations.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06852v1
Unlearning for Federated Online Learning to Rank: A Reproducibility   Study,"This paper reports on findings from a comparative study on the effectiveness and efficiency of federated unlearning strategies within Federated Online Learning to Rank (FOLTR), with specific attention to systematically analysing the unlearning capabilities of methods in a verifiable manner.   Federated approaches to ranking of search results have recently garnered attention to address users privacy concerns. In FOLTR, privacy is safeguarded by collaboratively training ranking models across decentralized data sources, preserving individual user data while optimizing search results based on implicit feedback, such as clicks.   Recent legislation introduced across numerous countries is establishing the so called ""the right to be forgotten"", according to which services based on machine learning models like those in FOLTR should provide capabilities that allow users to remove their own data from those used to train models. This has sparked the development of unlearning methods, along with evaluation practices to measure whether unlearning of a user data successfully occurred. Current evaluation practices are however often controversial, necessitating the use of multiple metrics for a more comprehensive assessment -- but previous proposals of unlearning methods only used single evaluation metrics.   This paper addresses this limitation: our study rigorously assesses the effectiveness of unlearning strategies in managing both under-unlearning and over-unlearning scenarios using adapted, and newly proposed evaluation metrics. Thanks to our detailed analysis, we uncover the strengths and limitations of five unlearning strategies, offering valuable insights into optimizing federated unlearning to balance data privacy and system performance within FOLTR. We publicly release our code and complete results at https://github.com/Iris1026/Unlearning-for-FOLTR.git.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12791v1
Path Gradients after Flow Matching,"Boltzmann Generators have emerged as a promising machine learning tool for generating samples from equilibrium distributions of molecular systems using Normalizing Flows and importance weighting. Recently, Flow Matching has helped speed up Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs), scale them to more complex molecular systems, and minimize the length of the flow integration trajectories. We investigate the benefits of using path gradients to fine-tune CNFs initially trained by Flow Matching, in the setting where a target energy is known. Our experiments show that this hybrid approach yields up to a threefold increase in sampling efficiency for molecular systems, all while using the same model, a similar computational budget and without the need for additional sampling. Furthermore, by measuring the length of the flow trajectories during fine-tuning, we show that path gradients largely preserve the learned structure of the flow.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10139v1
FedHQ: Hybrid Runtime Quantization for Federated Learning,"Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized model training approach that preserves data privacy but struggles with low efficiency. Quantization, a powerful training optimization technique, has been widely explored for integration into FL. However, many studies fail to consider the distinct performance attribution between particular quantization strategies, such as post-training quantization (PTQ) or quantization-aware training (QAT). As a result, existing FL quantization methods rely solely on either PTQ or QAT, optimizing for speed or accuracy while compromising the other. To efficiently accelerate FL and maintain distributed convergence accuracy across various FL settings, this paper proposes a hybrid quantitation approach combining PTQ and QAT for FL systems. We conduct case studies to validate the effectiveness of using hybrid quantization in FL. To solve the difficulty of modeling speed and accuracy caused by device and data heterogeneity, we propose a hardware-related analysis and data-distribution-related analysis to help identify the trade-off boundaries for strategy selection. Based on these, we proposed a novel framework named FedHQ to automatically adopt optimal hybrid strategy allocation for FL systems. Specifically, FedHQ develops a coarse-grained global initialization and fine-grained ML-based adjustment to ensure efficiency and robustness. Experiments show that FedHQ achieves up to 2.47x times training acceleration and up to 11.15% accuracy improvement and negligible extra overhead.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11982v1
Feature Representation Transferring to Lightweight Models via Perception   Coherence,"In this paper, we propose a method for transferring feature representation to lightweight student models from larger teacher models. We mathematically define a new notion called \textit{perception coherence}. Based on this notion, we propose a loss function, which takes into account the dissimilarities between data points in feature space through their ranking. At a high level, by minimizing this loss function, the student model learns to mimic how the teacher model \textit{perceives} inputs. More precisely, our method is motivated by the fact that the representational capacity of the student model is weaker than the teacher model. Hence, we aim to develop a new method allowing for a better relaxation. This means that, the student model does not need to preserve the absolute geometry of the teacher one, while preserving global coherence through dissimilarity ranking. Our theoretical insights provide a probabilistic perspective on the process of feature representation transfer. Our experiments results show that our method outperforms or achieves on-par performance compared to strong baseline methods for representation transferring.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06595v1
"It's not you, it's me -- Global urban visual perception varies across   demographics and personalities","Understanding people's preferences and needs is crucial for urban planning decisions, yet current approaches often combine them from multi-cultural and multi-city populations, obscuring important demographic differences and risking amplifying biases. We conducted a large-scale urban visual perception survey of streetscapes worldwide using street view imagery, examining how demographics -- including gender, age, income, education, race and ethnicity, and, for the first time, personality traits -- shape perceptions among 1,000 participants, with balanced demographics, from five countries and 45 nationalities. This dataset, introduced as Street Perception Evaluation Considering Socioeconomics (SPECS), exhibits statistically significant differences in perception scores in six traditionally used indicators (safe, lively, wealthy, beautiful, boring, and depressing) and four new ones we propose (live nearby, walk, cycle, green) among demographics and personalities. We revealed that location-based sentiments are carried over in people's preferences when comparing urban streetscapes with other cities. Further, we compared the perception scores based on where participants and streetscapes are from. We found that an off-the-shelf machine learning model trained on an existing global perception dataset tends to overestimate positive indicators and underestimate negative ones compared to human responses, suggesting that targeted intervention should consider locals' perception. Our study aspires to rectify the myopic treatment of street perception, which rarely considers demographics or personality traits.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12758v1
Neural Functional: Learning Function to Scalar Maps for Neural PDE   Surrogates,"Many architectures for neural PDE surrogates have been proposed in recent years, largely based on neural networks or operator learning. In this work, we derive and propose a new architecture, the Neural Functional, which learns function to scalar mappings. Its implementation leverages insights from operator learning and neural fields, and we show the ability of neural functionals to implicitly learn functional derivatives. For the first time, this allows for an extension of Hamiltonian mechanics to neural PDE surrogates by learning the Hamiltonian functional and optimizing its functional derivatives. We demonstrate that the Hamiltonian Neural Functional can be an effective surrogate model through improved stability and conserving energy-like quantities on 1D and 2D PDEs. Beyond PDEs, functionals are prevalent in physics; functional approximation and learning with its gradients may find other uses, such as in molecular dynamics or design optimization.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13275v1
Online Functional Principal Component Analysis on a Multidimensional   Domain,"Multidimensional functional data streams arise in diverse scientific fields, yet their analysis poses significant challenges. We propose a novel online framework for functional principal component analysis that enables efficient and scalable modeling of such data. Our method represents functional principal components using tensor product splines, enforcing smoothness and orthonormality through a penalized framework on a Stiefel manifold. An efficient Riemannian stochastic gradient descent algorithm is developed, with extensions inspired by adaptive moment estimation and averaging techniques to accelerate convergence. Additionally, a dynamic tuning strategy for smoothing parameter selection is developed based on a rolling averaged block validation score that adapts to the streaming nature of the data. Extensive simulations and real-world applications demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework for analyzing multidimensional functional data.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02131v1
RECON: Robust symmetry discovery via Explicit Canonical Orientation   Normalization,"Real-world data often exhibits unknown or approximate symmetries, yet existing equivariant networks must commit to a fixed transformation group prior to training, e.g., continuous $SO(2)$ rotations. This mismatch degrades performance when the actual data symmetries differ from those in the transformation group. We introduce RECON, a framework to discover each input's intrinsic symmetry distribution from unlabeled data. RECON leverages class-pose decompositions and applies a data-driven normalization to align arbitrary reference frames into a common natural pose, yielding directly comparable and interpretable symmetry descriptors. We demonstrate effective symmetry discovery on 2D image benchmarks and -- for the first time -- extend it to 3D transformation groups, paving the way towards more flexible equivariant modeling.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13289v1
Proximal optimal transport divergences,"We introduce proximal optimal transport divergence, a novel discrepancy measure that interpolates between information divergences and optimal transport distances via an infimal convolution formulation. This divergence provides a principled foundation for optimal transport proximals and proximal optimization methods frequently used in generative modeling. We explore its mathematical properties, including smoothness, boundedness, and computational tractability, and establish connections to primal-dual formulation and adversarial learning. Building on the Benamou-Brenier dynamic formulation of optimal transport cost, we also establish a dynamic formulation for proximal OT divergences. The resulting dynamic formulation is a first order mean-field game whose optimality conditions are governed by a pair of nonlinear partial differential equations, a backward Hamilton-Jacobi and a forward continuity partial differential equations. Our framework generalizes existing approaches while offering new insights and computational tools for generative modeling, distributional optimization, and gradient-based learning in probability spaces.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12097v1
Fair Representation Learning for Continuous Sensitive Attributes using   Expectation of Integral Probability Metrics,"AI fairness, also known as algorithmic fairness, aims to ensure that algorithms operate without bias or discrimination towards any individual or group. Among various AI algorithms, the Fair Representation Learning (FRL) approach has gained significant interest in recent years. However, existing FRL algorithms have a limitation: they are primarily designed for categorical sensitive attributes and thus cannot be applied to continuous sensitive attributes, such as age or income. In this paper, we propose an FRL algorithm for continuous sensitive attributes. First, we introduce a measure called the Expectation of Integral Probability Metrics (EIPM) to assess the fairness level of representation space for continuous sensitive attributes. We demonstrate that if the distribution of the representation has a low EIPM value, then any prediction head constructed on the top of the representation become fair, regardless of the selection of the prediction head. Furthermore, EIPM possesses a distinguished advantage in that it can be accurately estimated using our proposed estimator with finite samples. Based on these properties, we propose a new FRL algorithm called Fair Representation using EIPM with MMD (FREM). Experimental evidences show that FREM outperforms other baseline methods.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06435v1
Role of scrambling and noise in temporal information processing with   quantum systems,"Scrambling quantum systems have been demonstrated as effective substrates for temporal information processing. While their role in providing rich feature maps has been widely studied, a theoretical understanding of their performance in temporal tasks is still lacking. Here we consider a general quantum reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast, the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove exponential memory decays with iterations for local noisy channels. Proving these results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding concentration in temporal quantum learning models.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10080v1
Efficient Optimization with Orthogonality Constraint: a Randomized   Riemannian Submanifold Method,"Optimization with orthogonality constraints frequently arises in various fields such as machine learning. Riemannian optimization offers a powerful framework for solving these problems by equipping the constraint set with a Riemannian manifold structure and performing optimization intrinsically on the manifold. This approach typically involves computing a search direction in the tangent space and updating variables via a retraction operation. However, as the size of the variables increases, the computational cost of the retraction can become prohibitively high, limiting the applicability of Riemannian optimization to large-scale problems. To address this challenge and enhance scalability, we propose a novel approach that restricts each update on a random submanifold, thereby significantly reducing the per-iteration complexity. We introduce two sampling strategies for selecting the random submanifolds and theoretically analyze the convergence of the proposed methods. We provide convergence results for general nonconvex functions and functions that satisfy Riemannian Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition as well as for stochastic optimization settings. Additionally, we demonstrate how our approach can be generalized to quotient manifolds derived from the orthogonal manifold. Extensive experiments verify the benefits of the proposed method, across a wide variety of problems.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12378v1
Emergence and scaling laws in SGD learning of shallow neural networks,"We study the complexity of online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for learning a two-layer neural network with $P$ neurons on isotropic Gaussian data: $f_*(\boldsymbol{x}) = \sum_{p=1}^P a_p\cdot \sigma(\langle\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{v}_p^*\rangle)$, $\boldsymbol{x} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\boldsymbol{I}_d)$, where the activation $\sigma:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is an even function with information exponent $k_*>2$ (defined as the lowest degree in the Hermite expansion), $\{\boldsymbol{v}^*_p\}_{p\in[P]}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ are orthonormal signal directions, and the non-negative second-layer coefficients satisfy $\sum_{p} a_p^2=1$. We focus on the challenging ``extensive-width'' regime $P\gg 1$ and permit diverging condition number in the second-layer, covering as a special case the power-law scaling $a_p\asymp p^{-\beta}$ where $\beta\in\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$. We provide a precise analysis of SGD dynamics for the training of a student two-layer network to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) objective, and explicitly identify sharp transition times to recover each signal direction. In the power-law setting, we characterize scaling law exponents for the MSE loss with respect to the number of training samples and SGD steps, as well as the number of parameters in the student neural network. Our analysis entails that while the learning of individual teacher neurons exhibits abrupt transitions, the juxtaposition of $P\gg 1$ emergent learning curves at different timescales leads to a smooth scaling law in the cumulative objective.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19983v1
Spiking Neural Network: a low power solution for physical layer   authentication,"Deep learning (DL) is a powerful tool that can solve complex problems, and thus, it seems natural to assume that DL can be used to enhance the security of wireless communication. However, deploying DL models to edge devices in wireless networks is challenging, as they require significant amounts of computing and power resources. Notably, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are known to be efficient in terms of power consumption, meaning they can be an alternative platform for DL models for edge devices. In this study, we ask if SNNs can be used in physical layer authentication. Our evaluation suggests that SNNs can learn unique physical properties (i.e., `fingerprints') of RF transmitters and use them to identify individual devices. Furthermore, we find that SNNs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that an autoencoder can be used clean out adversarial perturbations to harden SNNs against them.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12647v1
Generalization Analysis for Contrastive Representation Learning under   Non-IID Settings,"Contrastive Representation Learning (CRL) has achieved impressive success in various domains in recent years. Nevertheless, the theoretical understanding of the generalization behavior of CRL is limited. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the current literature only analyzes generalization bounds under the assumption that the data tuples used for contrastive learning are independently and identically distributed. However, in practice, we are often limited to a fixed pool of reusable labeled data points, making it inevitable to recycle data across tuples to create sufficiently large datasets. Therefore, the tuple-wise independence condition imposed by previous works is invalidated. In this paper, we provide a generalization analysis for the CRL framework under non-$i.i.d.$ settings that adheres to practice more realistically. Drawing inspiration from the literature on U-statistics, we derive generalization bounds which indicate the required number of samples in each class scales as the logarithm of the covering number of the class of learnable feature representations associated to each class. Next, we apply our main results to derive excess risk bounds for common function classes such as linear maps and neural networks.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04937v1
Geometry-aware Active Learning of Spatiotemporal Dynamic Systems,"Rapid developments in advanced sensing and imaging have significantly enhanced information visibility, opening opportunities for predictive modeling of complex dynamic systems. However, sensing signals acquired from such complex systems are often distributed across 3D geometries and rapidly evolving over time, posing significant challenges in spatiotemporal predictive modeling. This paper proposes a geometry-aware active learning framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we propose a geometry-aware spatiotemporal Gaussian Process (G-ST-GP) to effectively integrate the temporal correlations and geometric manifold features for reliable prediction of high-dimensional dynamic behaviors. In addition, we develop an adaptive active learning strategy to strategically identify informative spatial locations for data collection and further maximize the prediction accuracy. This strategy achieves the adaptive trade-off between the prediction uncertainty in the G-ST-GP model and the space-filling design guided by the geodesic distance across the 3D geometry. We implement the proposed framework to model the spatiotemporal electrodynamics in a 3D heart geometry. Numerical experiments show that our framework outperforms traditional methods lacking the mechanism of geometric information incorporation or effective data collection.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19012v2
Theoretical Investigation on Inductive Bias of Isolation Forest,"Isolation Forest (iForest) stands out as a widely-used unsupervised anomaly detector valued for its exceptional runtime efficiency and performance on large-scale tasks. Despite its widespread adoption, a theoretical foundation explaining iForest's success remains unclear. This paper theoretically investigates the conditions and extent of iForest's effectiveness by analyzing its inductive bias through the formulation of depth functions and growth processes. Since directly analyzing the depth function proves intractable due to iForest's random splitting mechanism, we model the growth process of iForest as a random walk, enabling us to derive the expected depth function using transition probabilities. Our case studies reveal key inductive biases: iForest exhibits lower sensitivity to central anomalies while demonstrating greater parameter adaptability compared to $k$-Nearest Neighbor anomaly detectors. Our study provides theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of iForest and establishes a foundation for further theoretical exploration.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12825v1
Multivariate Conformal Selection,"Selecting high-quality candidates from large datasets is critical in applications such as drug discovery, precision medicine, and alignment of large language models (LLMs). While Conformal Selection (CS) provides rigorous uncertainty quantification, it is limited to univariate responses and scalar criteria. To address this issue, we propose Multivariate Conformal Selection (mCS), a generalization of CS designed for multivariate response settings. Our method introduces regional monotonicity and employs multivariate nonconformity scores to construct conformal p-values, enabling finite-sample False Discovery Rate (FDR) control. We present two variants: mCS-dist, using distance-based scores, and mCS-learn, which learns optimal scores via differentiable optimization. Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that mCS significantly improves selection power while maintaining FDR control, establishing it as a robust framework for multivariate selection tasks.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00917v1
Bayesian Estimation of Causal Effects Using Proxies of a Latent   Interference Network,"Network interference occurs when treatments assigned to some units affect the outcomes of others. Traditional approaches often assume that the observed network correctly specifies the interference structure. However, in practice, researchers frequently only have access to proxy measurements of the interference network due to limitations in data collection or potential mismatches between measured networks and actual interference pathways. In this paper, we introduce a framework for estimating causal effects when only proxy networks are available. Our approach leverages a structural causal model that accommodates diverse proxy types, including noisy measurements, multiple data sources, and multilayer networks, and defines causal effects as interventions on population-level treatments. Since the true interference network is latent, estimation poses significant challenges. To overcome them, we develop a Bayesian inference framework. We propose a Block Gibbs sampler with Locally Informed Proposals to update the latent network, thereby efficiently exploring the high-dimensional posterior space composed of both discrete and continuous parameters. We illustrate the performance of our method through numerical experiments, demonstrating its accuracy in recovering causal effects even when only proxies of the interference network are available.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08395v1
Nash: Neural Adaptive Shrinkage for Structured High-Dimensional   Regression,"Sparse linear regression is a fundamental tool in data analysis. However, traditional approaches often fall short when covariates exhibit structure or arise from heterogeneous sources. In biomedical applications, covariates may stem from distinct modalities or be structured according to an underlying graph. We introduce Neural Adaptive Shrinkage (Nash), a unified framework that integrates covariate-specific side information into sparse regression via neural networks. Nash adaptively modulates penalties on a per-covariate basis, learning to tailor regularization without cross-validation. We develop a variational inference algorithm for efficient training and establish connections to empirical Bayes regression. Experiments on real data demonstrate that Nash can improve accuracy and adaptability over existing methods.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11143v1
Reconstructing Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Traffic Flow   Modeling: a Multi-Gradient Descent and Pareto Learning Approach,"Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is crucial in modern traffic flow modeling because it combines the benefits of both physics-based and data-driven approaches. In conventional PIML, physical information is typically incorporated by constructing a hybrid loss function that combines data-driven loss and physics loss through linear scalarization. The goal is to find a trade-off between these two objectives to improve the accuracy of model predictions. However, from a mathematical perspective, linear scalarization is limited to identifying only the convex region of the Pareto front, as it treats data-driven and physics losses as separate objectives. Given that most PIML loss functions are non-convex, linear scalarization restricts the achievable trade-off solutions. Moreover, tuning the weighting coefficients for the two loss components can be both time-consuming and computationally challenging. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a paradigm shift in PIML by reformulating the training process as a multi-objective optimization problem, treating data-driven loss and physics loss independently. We apply several multi-gradient descent algorithms (MGDAs), including traditional multi-gradient descent (TMGD) and dual cone gradient descent (DCGD), to explore the Pareto front in this multi-objective setting. These methods are evaluated on both macroscopic and microscopic traffic flow models. In the macroscopic case, MGDAs achieved comparable performance to traditional linear scalarization methods. Notably, in the microscopic case, MGDAs significantly outperformed their scalarization-based counterparts, demonstrating the advantages of a multi-objective optimization approach in complex PIML scenarios.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13241v1
Extended Fiducial Inference for Individual Treatment Effects via Deep   Neural Networks,"Individual treatment effect estimation has gained significant attention in recent data science literature. This work introduces the Double Neural Network (Double-NN) method to address this problem within the framework of extended fiducial inference (EFI). In the proposed method, deep neural networks are used to model the treatment and control effect functions, while an additional neural network is employed to estimate their parameters. The universal approximation capability of deep neural networks ensures the broad applicability of this method. Numerical results highlight the superior performance of the proposed Double-NN method compared to the conformal quantile regression (CQR) method in individual treatment effect estimation. From the perspective of statistical inference, this work advances the theory and methodology for statistical inference of large models. Specifically, it is theoretically proven that the proposed method permits the model size to increase with the sample size $n$ at a rate of $O(n^{\zeta})$ for some $0 \leq \zeta<1$, while still maintaining proper quantification of uncertainty in the model parameters. This result marks a significant improvement compared to the range $0\leq \zeta < \frac{1}{2}$ required by the classical central limit theorem. Furthermore, this work provides a rigorous framework for quantifying the uncertainty of deep neural networks under the neural scaling law, representing a substantial contribution to the statistical understanding of large-scale neural network models.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01995v1
Towards Cross-Modality Modeling for Time Series Analytics: A Survey in   the LLM Era,"The proliferation of edge devices has generated an unprecedented volume of time series data across different domains, motivating various well-customized methods. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm for time series analytics by leveraging the shared sequential nature of textual data and time series. However, a fundamental cross-modality gap between time series and LLMs exists, as LLMs are pre-trained on textual corpora and are not inherently optimized for time series. Many recent proposals are designed to address this issue. In this survey, we provide an up-to-date overview of LLMs-based cross-modality modeling for time series analytics. We first introduce a taxonomy that classifies existing approaches into four groups based on the type of textual data employed for time series modeling. We then summarize key cross-modality strategies, e.g., alignment and fusion, and discuss their applications across a range of downstream tasks. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on multimodal datasets from different application domains to investigate effective combinations of textual data and cross-modality strategies for enhancing time series analytics. Finally, we suggest several promising directions for future research. This survey is designed for a range of professionals, researchers, and practitioners interested in LLM-based time series modeling.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02583v1

High-Dimensional Dynamic Covariance Models with Random Forests,"This paper introduces a novel nonparametric method for estimating high-dimensional dynamic covariance matrices with multiple conditioning covariates, leveraging random forests and supported by robust theoretical guarantees. Unlike traditional static methods, our dynamic nonparametric covariance models effectively capture distributional heterogeneity. Furthermore, unlike kernel-smoothing methods, which are restricted to a single conditioning covariate, our approach accommodates multiple covariates in a fully nonparametric framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to use random forests for estimating high-dimensional dynamic covariance matrices. In high-dimensional settings, we establish uniform consistency theory, providing nonasymptotic error rates and model selection properties, even when the response dimension grows sub-exponentially with the sample size. These results hold uniformly across a range of conditioning variables. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through simulations and a stock dataset analysis, highlighting its ability to model complex dynamics in high-dimensional scenarios.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12444v1
Learning from Samples: Inverse Problems over measures via Sharpened   Fenchel-Young Losses,"Estimating parameters from samples of an optimal probability distribution is essential in applications ranging from socio-economic modeling to biological system analysis. In these settings, the probability distribution arises as the solution to an optimization problem that captures either static interactions among agents or the dynamic evolution of a system over time. Our approach relies on minimizing a new class of loss functions, called sharpened Fenchel-Young losses, which measure the sub-optimality gap of the optimization problem over the space of measures. We study the stability of this estimation method when only a finite number of sample is available. The parameters to be estimated typically correspond to a cost function in static problems and to a potential function in dynamic problems. To analyze stability, we introduce a general methodology that leverages the strong convexity of the loss function together with the sample complexity of the forward optimization problem. Our analysis emphasizes two specific settings in the context of optimal transport, where our method provides explicit stability guarantees: The first is inverse unbalanced optimal transport (iUOT) with entropic regularization, where the parameters to estimate are cost functions that govern transport computations; this method has applications such as link prediction in machine learning. The second is inverse gradient flow (iJKO), where the objective is to recover a potential function that drives the evolution of a probability distribution via the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) time-discretization scheme; this is particularly relevant for understanding cell population dynamics in single-cell genomics. Finally, we validate our approach through numerical experiments on Gaussian distributions, where closed-form solutions are available, to demonstrate the practical performance of our methods",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07124v1
Learning Linearized Models from Nonlinear Systems under Initialization   Constraints with Finite Data,"The identification of a linear system model from data has wide applications in control theory. The existing work that provides finite sample guarantees for linear system identification typically uses data from a single long system trajectory under i.i.d. random inputs, and assumes that the underlying dynamics is truly linear. In contrast, we consider the problem of identifying a linearized model when the true underlying dynamics is nonlinear, given that there is a certain constraint on the region where one can initialize the experiments. We provide a multiple trajectories-based deterministic data acquisition algorithm followed by a regularized least squares algorithm, and provide a finite sample error bound on the learned linearized dynamics. Our error bound shows that one can consistently learn the linearized dynamics, and demonstrates a trade-off between the error due to nonlinearity and the error due to noise. We validate our results through numerical experiments, where we also show the potential insufficiency of linear system identification using a single trajectory with i.i.d. random inputs, when nonlinearity does exist.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04954v1
Mean Flows for One-step Generative Modeling,"We propose a principled and effective framework for one-step generative modeling. We introduce the notion of average velocity to characterize flow fields, in contrast to instantaneous velocity modeled by Flow Matching methods. A well-defined identity between average and instantaneous velocities is derived and used to guide neural network training. Our method, termed the MeanFlow model, is self-contained and requires no pre-training, distillation, or curriculum learning. MeanFlow demonstrates strong empirical performance: it achieves an FID of 3.43 with a single function evaluation (1-NFE) on ImageNet 256x256 trained from scratch, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art one-step diffusion/flow models. Our study substantially narrows the gap between one-step diffusion/flow models and their multi-step predecessors, and we hope it will motivate future research to revisit the foundations of these powerful models.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13447v1
Local linear Fréchet curve regression in manifolds,"Global Fr\'echet functional regression has been recently addressed from time correlated bivariate curve data evaluated in a manifold (see Torres et al. 2025). For this type of curve data sets, the present paper solves the problem of local linear approximation of the Fr\'echet conditional mean in an extrinsic and intrinsic way. The extrinsic local linear Fr\'echet functional regression predictor is obtained in the time varying tangent space by projection into an orthornormal basis of the ambient Hilbert space. The conditions assumed ensure the existence and uniqueness of this predictor, and its computation via exponential and logarithmic maps. A weighted Fr\'echet mean approach is adopted in the computation of an intrinsic local linear Fr\'echet functional regression predictor. The asymptotic optimality of this intrinsic local approximation is also proved. The performance of the empirical version of both, extrinsic and intrinsic functional predictors, and of a Nadaraya-Watson type Fr\'echet curve predictor is illustrated in the simulation study undertaken. The finite-sample size properties are also tested in a real-data application via cross-validation. Specifically, functional prediction of the magnetic vector field from the time-varying geocentric latitude and longitude of the satellite NASA's MAGSAT spacecraft is addressed.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05168v1
HessFormer: Hessians at Foundation Scale,"Whilst there have been major advancements in the field of first order optimisation of deep learning models, where state of the art open source mixture of expert models go into the hundreds of billions of parameters, methods that rely on Hessian vector products, are still limited to run on a single GPU and thus cannot even work for models in the billion parameter range. We release a software package \textbf{HessFormer}, which integrates nicely with the well known Transformers package and allows for distributed hessian vector computation across a single node with multiple GPUs. Underpinning our implementation is a distributed stochastic lanczos quadrature algorithm, which we release for public consumption.

An Efficient Transport-Based Dissimilarity Measure for Time Series   Classification under Warping Distortions,"Time Series Classification (TSC) is an important problem with numerous applications in science and technology. Dissimilarity-based approaches, such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), are classical methods for distinguishing time series when time deformations are confounding information. In this paper, starting from a deformation-based model for signal classes we define a problem statement for time series classification problem. We show that, under theoretically ideal conditions, a continuous version of classic 1NN-DTW method can solve the stated problem, even when only one training sample is available. In addition, we propose an alternative dissimilarity measure based on Optimal Transport and show that it can also solve the aforementioned problem statement at a significantly reduced computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the newly proposed approach in simulated and real time series classification data, showing the efficacy of the method.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05676v2
Ambiguity Resolution in Text-to-Structured Data Mapping,"Ambiguity in natural language is a significant obstacle for achieving accurate text to structured data mapping through large language models (LLMs), which affects the performance of tasks such as mapping text to agentic tool calling and text-to-SQL queries. Existing methods of ambiguity handling either exploit ReACT framework to produce the correct mapping through trial and error, or supervised fine tuning to guide models to produce a biased mapping to improve certain tasks. In this paper, we adopt a different approach that characterizes the representation difference of ambiguous text in the latent space and leverage the difference to identify ambiguity before mapping them to structured data. To detect ambiguity of a sentence, we focused on the relationship between ambiguous questions and their interpretations and what cause the LLM ignore multiple interpretations. Different to the distance calculated by dense embedding vectors, we utilize the observation that ambiguity is caused by concept missing in latent space of LLM to design a new distance measurement, computed through the path kernel by the integral of gradient values for each concepts from sparse-autoencoder (SAE) under each state. We identify patterns to distinguish ambiguous questions with this measurement. Based on our observation, We propose a new framework to improve the performance of LLMs on ambiguous agentic tool calling through missing concepts prediction.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11679v1
On Measuring Intrinsic Causal Attributions in Deep Neural Networks,"Quantifying the causal influence of input features within neural networks has become a topic of increasing interest. Existing approaches typically assess direct, indirect, and total causal effects. This work treats NNs as structural causal models (SCMs) and extends our focus to include intrinsic causal contributions (ICC). We propose an identifiable generative post-hoc framework for quantifying ICC. We also draw a relationship between ICC and Sobol' indices. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ICC generates more intuitive and reliable explanations compared to existing global explanation techniques.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09660v1
Enabling Local Neural Operators to perform Equation-Free System-Level   Analysis,"Neural Operators (NOs) provide a powerful framework for computations involving physical laws that can be modelled by (integro-) partial differential equations (PDEs), directly learning maps between infinite-dimensional function spaces that bypass both the explicit equation identification and their subsequent numerical solving. Still, NOs have so far primarily been employed to explore the dynamical behavior as surrogates of brute-force temporal simulations/predictions. Their potential for systematic rigorous numerical system-level tasks, such as fixed-point, stability, and bifurcation analysis - crucial for predicting irreversible transitions in real-world phenomena - remains largely unexplored. Toward this aim, inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale framework, we propose and implement a framework that integrates (local) NOs with advanced iterative numerical methods in the Krylov subspace, so as to perform efficient system-level stability and bifurcation analysis of large-scale dynamical systems. Beyond fixed point, stability, and bifurcation analysis enabled by local in time NOs, we also demonstrate the usefulness of local in space as well as in space-time (""patch"") NOs in accelerating the computer-aided analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics. We illustrate our framework via three nonlinear PDE benchmarks: the 1D Allen-Cahn equation, which undergoes multiple concatenated pitchfork bifurcations; the Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand PDE, which features a saddle-node tipping point; and the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, consisting of two coupled PDEs that exhibit both Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02308v1
Mitigating Bias in Facial Recognition Systems: Centroid Fairness Loss   Optimization,"The urging societal demand for fair AI systems has put pressure on the research community to develop predictive models that are not only globally accurate but also meet new fairness criteria, reflecting the lack of disparate mistreatment with respect to sensitive attributes ($\textit{e.g.}$ gender, ethnicity, age). In particular, the variability of the errors made by certain Facial Recognition (FR) systems across specific segments of the population compromises the deployment of the latter, and was judged unacceptable by regulatory authorities. Designing fair FR systems is a very challenging problem, mainly due to the complex and functional nature of the performance measure used in this domain ($\textit{i.e.}$ ROC curves) and because of the huge heterogeneity of the face image datasets usually available for training. In this paper, we propose a novel post-processing approach to improve the fairness of pre-trained FR models by optimizing a regression loss which acts on centroid-based scores. Beyond the computational advantages of the method, we present numerical experiments providing strong empirical evidence of the gain in fairness and of the ability to preserve global accuracy.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19370v1
Multi-Order Wavelet Derivative Transform for Deep Time Series   Forecasting,"In deep time series forecasting, the Fourier Transform (FT) is extensively employed for frequency representation learning. However, it often struggles in capturing multi-scale, time-sensitive patterns. Although the Wavelet Transform (WT) can capture these patterns through frequency decomposition, its coefficients are insensitive to change points in time series, leading to suboptimal modeling. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce the multi-order Wavelet Derivative Transform (WDT) grounded in the WT, enabling the extraction of time-aware patterns spanning both the overall trend and subtle fluctuations. Compared with the standard FT and WT, which model the raw series, the WDT operates on the derivative of the series, selectively magnifying rate-of-change cues and exposing abrupt regime shifts that are particularly informative for time series modeling. Practically, we embed the WDT into a multi-branch framework named WaveTS, which decomposes the input series into multi-scale time-frequency coefficients, refines them via linear layers, and reconstructs them into the time domain via the inverse WDT. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that WaveTS achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while retaining high computational efficiency.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11781v1
Humble your Overconfident Networks: Unlearning Overfitting via   Sequential Monte Carlo Tempered Deep Ensembles,"Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods offer a principled approach to Bayesian uncertainty quantification but are traditionally limited by the need for full-batch gradient evaluations. We introduce a scalable variant by incorporating Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) proposals into SMC, enabling efficient mini-batch based sampling. Our resulting SMCSGHMC algorithm outperforms standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and deep ensembles across image classification, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, and transfer learning tasks. We further show that SMCSGHMC mitigates overfitting and improves calibration, providing a flexible, scalable pathway for converting pretrained neural networks into well-calibrated Bayesian models.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11671v1
Learning on a Razor's Edge: the Singularity Bias of Polynomial Neural   Networks,"Deep neural networks often infer sparse representations, converging to a subnetwork during the learning process. In this work, we theoretically analyze subnetworks and their bias through the lens of algebraic geometry. We consider fully-connected networks with polynomial activation functions, and focus on the geometry of the function space they parametrize, often referred to as neuromanifold. First, we compute the dimension of the subspace of the neuromanifold parametrized by subnetworks. Second, we show that this subspace is singular. Third, we argue that such singularities often correspond to critical points of the training dynamics. Lastly, we discuss convolutional networks, for which subnetworks and singularities are similarly related, but the bias does not arise.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11846v1
Model uncertainty quantification using feature confidence sets for   outcome excursions,"When implementing prediction models for high-stakes real-world applications such as medicine, finance, and autonomous systems, quantifying prediction uncertainty is critical for effective risk management. Traditional approaches to uncertainty quantification, such as confidence and prediction intervals, provide probability coverage guarantees for the expected outcomes $f(\boldsymbol{x})$ or the realized outcomes $f(\boldsymbol{x})+\epsilon$. Instead, this paper introduces a novel, model-agnostic framework for quantifying uncertainty in continuous and binary outcomes using confidence sets for outcome excursions, where the goal is to identify a subset of the feature space where the expected or realized outcome exceeds a specific value. The proposed method constructs data-dependent inner and outer confidence sets that aim to contain the true feature subset for which the expected or realized outcomes of these features exceed a specified threshold. We establish theoretical guarantees for the probability that these confidence sets contain the true feature subset, both asymptotically and for finite sample sizes. The framework is validated through simulations and applied to real-world datasets, demonstrating its utility in contexts such as housing price prediction and time to sepsis diagnosis in healthcare. This approach provides a unified method for uncertainty quantification that is broadly applicable across various continuous and binary prediction models.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19464v1
A Symbolic and Statistical Learning Framework to Discover Bioprocessing   Regulatory Mechanism: Cell Culture Example,"Bioprocess mechanistic modeling is essential for advancing intelligent digital twin representation of biomanufacturing, yet challenges persist due to complex intracellular regulation, stochastic system behavior, and limited experimental data. This paper introduces a symbolic and statistical learning framework to identify key regulatory mechanisms and quantify model uncertainty. Bioprocess dynamics is formulated with stochastic differential equations characterizing intrinsic process variability, with a predefined set of candidate regulatory mechanisms constructed from biological knowledge. A Bayesian learning approach is developed, which is based on a joint learning of kinetic parameters and regulatory structure through a formulation of the mixture model. To enhance computational efficiency, a Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm with adjoint sensitivity analysis is developed for posterior exploration. Compared to state-of-the-art Bayesian inference approaches, the proposed framework achieves improved sample efficiency and robust model selection. An empirical study demonstrates its ability to recover missing regulatory mechanisms and improve model fidelity under data-limited conditions.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03177v1
Fairness-aware Bayes optimal functional classification,"Algorithmic fairness has become a central topic in machine learning, and mitigating disparities across different subpopulations has emerged as a rapidly growing research area. In this paper, we systematically study the classification of functional data under fairness constraints, ensuring the disparity level of the classifier is controlled below a pre-specified threshold. We propose a unified framework for fairness-aware functional classification, tackling an infinite-dimensional functional space, addressing key challenges from the absence of density ratios and intractability of posterior probabilities, and discussing unique phenomena in functional classification. We further design a post-processing algorithm, Fair Functional Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier (Fair-FLDA), which targets at homoscedastic Gaussian processes and achieves fairness via group-wise thresholding. Under weak structural assumptions on eigenspace, theoretical guarantees on fairness and excess risk controls are established. As a byproduct, our results cover the excess risk control of the standard FLDA as a special case, which, to the best of our knowledge, is first time seen. Our theoretical findings are complemented by extensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real datasets, highlighting the practicality of our designed algorithm.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09471v1
On the Mechanisms of Adversarial Data Augmentation for Robust and   Adaptive Transfer Learning,"Transfer learning across domains with distribution shift remains a fundamental challenge in building robust and adaptable machine learning systems. While adversarial perturbations are traditionally viewed as threats that expose model vulnerabilities, recent studies suggest that they can also serve as constructive tools for data augmentation. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of adversarial data augmentation (ADA) in enhancing both robustness and adaptivity in transfer learning settings. We analyze how adversarial examples, when used strategically during training, improve domain generalization by enriching decision boundaries and reducing overfitting to source-domain-specific features. We further propose a unified framework that integrates ADA with consistency regularization and domain-invariant representation learning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets -- including VisDA, DomainNet, and Office-Home -- demonstrate that our method consistently improves target-domain performance under both unsupervised and few-shot domain adaptation settings. Our results highlight a constructive perspective of adversarial learning, transforming perturbation from a destructive attack into a regularizing force for cross-domain transferability.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12681v1
Scalable Importance Sampling in High Dimensions with Low-Rank Mixture   Proposals,"Importance sampling is a Monte Carlo technique for efficiently estimating the likelihood of rare events by biasing the sampling distribution towards the rare event of interest. By drawing weighted samples from a learned proposal distribution, importance sampling allows for more sample-efficient estimation of rare events or tails of distributions. A common choice of proposal density is a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). However, estimating full-rank GMM covariance matrices in high dimensions is a challenging task due to numerical instabilities. In this work, we propose using mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzers (MPPCA) as the parametric proposal density for importance sampling methods. MPPCA models are a type of low-rank mixture model that can be fit quickly using expectation-maximization, even in high-dimensional spaces. We validate our method on three simulated systems, demonstrating consistent gains in sample efficiency and quality of failure distribution characterization.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13335v1
A Dictionary of Closed-Form Kernel Mean Embeddings,"Kernel mean embeddings -- integrals of a kernel with respect to a probability distribution -- are essential in Bayesian quadrature, but also widely used in other computational tools for numerical integration or for statistical inference based on the maximum mean discrepancy. These methods often require, or are enhanced by, the availability of a closed-form expression for the kernel mean embedding. However, deriving such expressions can be challenging, limiting the applicability of kernel-based techniques when practitioners do not have access to a closed-form embedding. This paper addresses this limitation by providing a comprehensive dictionary of known kernel mean embeddings, along with practical tools for deriving new embeddings from known ones. We also provide a Python library that includes minimal implementations of the embeddings.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18830v1
New affine invariant ensemble samplers and their dimensional scaling,"We introduce some new affine invariant ensemble samplers that are easy to construct and improve upon existing widely used algorithms, especially for high-dimensional problems. Specifically, we propose a derivative-free ensemble side move sampler that performs favorably compared to popular samplers in the \texttt{emcee} package. Additionally, we develop a class of derivative-based ensemble Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) samplers with affine invariance, which outperform standard HMC without affine invariance when sampling highly skewed distributions. We provide asymptotic scaling analysis for high-dimensional Gaussian targets to further elucidate the properties of these affine invariant ensemble samplers. In particular, with derivative information, the affine invariant ensemble HMC can scale much better with dimension compared to derivative-free ensemble samplers.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02987v1
Stereographic Multi-Try Metropolis Algorithms for Heavy-tailed Sampling,"Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from heavy-tailed distributions present unique challenges, particularly in high dimensions. Multi-proposal MCMC algorithms have recently gained attention for their potential to improve performance, especially through parallel implementation on modern hardware. This paper introduces a novel family of gradient-free MCMC algorithms that combine the multi-try Metropolis (MTM) with stereographic MCMC framework, specifically designed for efficient sampling from heavy-tailed targets. The proposed stereographic multi-try Metropolis (SMTM) algorithm not only outperforms traditional Euclidean MTM and existing stereographic random-walk Metropolis methods, but also avoids the pathological convergence behavior often observed in MTM and demonstrates strong robustness to tuning. These properties are supported by scaling analysis and extensive simulation studies.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12487v1
Causal Identification in Time Series Models,"In this paper, we analyze the applicability of the Causal Identification algorithm to causal time series graphs with latent confounders. Since these graphs extend over infinitely many time steps, deciding whether causal effects across arbitrary time intervals are identifiable appears to require computation on graph segments of unbounded size. Even for deciding the identifiability of intervention effects on variables that are close in time, no bound is known on how many time steps in the past need to be considered. We give a first bound of this kind that only depends on the number of variables per time step and the maximum time lag of any direct or latent causal effect. More generally, we show that applying the Causal Identification algorithm to a constant-size segment of the time series graph is sufficient to decide identifiability of causal effects, even across unbounded time intervals.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20172v1
ConDiSim: Conditional Diffusion Models for Simulation Based Inference,"We present a conditional diffusion model - ConDiSim, for simulation-based inference of complex systems with intractable likelihoods. ConDiSim leverages denoising diffusion probabilistic models to approximate posterior distributions, consisting of a forward process that adds Gaussian noise to parameters, and a reverse process learning to denoise, conditioned on observed data. This approach effectively captures complex dependencies and multi-modalities within posteriors. ConDiSim is evaluated across ten benchmark problems and two real-world test problems, where it demonstrates effective posterior approximation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency and stability in model training. ConDiSim offers a robust and extensible framework for simulation-based inference, particularly suitable for parameter inference workflows requiring fast inference methods.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08403v1
Rank-One Modified Value Iteration,"In this paper, we provide a novel algorithm for solving planning and learning problems of Markov decision processes. The proposed algorithm follows a policy iteration-type update by using a rank-one approximation of the transition probability matrix in the policy evaluation step. This rank-one approximation is closely related to the stationary distribution of the corresponding transition probability matrix, which is approximated using the power method. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the proposed algorithm to optimal (action-)value function with the same rate and computational complexity as the value iteration algorithm in the planning problem and as the Q-learning algorithm in the learning problem. Through our extensive numerical simulations, however, we show that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms first-order algorithms and their accelerated versions for both planning and learning problems.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01828v1
Langevin Diffusion Approximation to Same Marginal Schrödinger Bridge,"We introduce a novel approximation to the same marginal Schr\""{o}dinger bridge using the Langevin diffusion. As $\varepsilon \downarrow 0$, it is known that the barycentric projection (also known as the entropic Brenier map) of the Schr\""{o}dinger bridge converges to the Brenier map, which is the identity. Our diffusion approximation is leveraged to show that, under suitable assumptions, the difference between the two is $\varepsilon$ times the gradient of the marginal log density (i.e., the score function), in $\mathbf{L}^2$. More generally, we show that the family of Markov operators, indexed by $\varepsilon > 0$, derived from integrating test functions against the conditional density of the static Schr\""{o}dinger bridge at temperature $\varepsilon$, admits a derivative at $\varepsilon=0$ given by the generator of the Langevin semigroup. Hence, these operators satisfy an approximate semigroup property at low temperatures.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07647v1
PyScrew: A Comprehensive Dataset Collection from Industrial Screw   Driving Experiments,"This paper presents a comprehensive collection of industrial screw driving datasets designed to advance research in manufacturing process monitoring and quality control. The collection comprises six distinct datasets with over 34,000 individual screw driving operations conducted under controlled experimental conditions, capturing the multifaceted nature of screw driving processes in plastic components. Each dataset systematically investigates specific aspects: natural thread degradation patterns through repeated use (s01), variations in surface friction conditions including contamination and surface treatments (s02), diverse assembly faults with up to 27 error types (s03-s04), and fabrication parameter variations in both upper and lower workpieces through modified injection molding settings (s05-s06). We detail the standardized experimental setup used across all datasets, including hardware specifications, process phases, and data acquisition methods. The hierarchical data model preserves the temporal and operational structure of screw driving processes, facilitating both exploratory analysis and the development of machine learning models. To maximize accessibility, we provide dual access pathways: raw data through Zenodo with a persistent DOI, and a purpose-built Python library (PyScrew) that offers consistent interfaces for data loading, preprocessing, and integration with common analysis workflows. These datasets serve diverse research applications including anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, quality control system development, feature extraction methodology evaluation, and classification of specific error conditions. By addressing the scarcity of standardized, comprehensive datasets in industrial manufacturing, this collection enables reproducible research and fair comparison of analytical approaches in an area of growing importance for industrial automation.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11925v1
Soft causal learning for generalized molecule property prediction: An   environment perspective,"Learning on molecule graphs has become an increasingly important topic in AI for science, which takes full advantage of AI to facilitate scientific discovery. Existing solutions on modeling molecules utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to achieve representations but they mostly fail to adapt models to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Although recent advances on OOD-oriented graph learning have discovered the invariant rationale on graphs, they still ignore three important issues, i.e., 1) the expanding atom patterns regarding environments on graphs lead to failures of invariant rationale based models, 2) the associations between discovered molecular subgraphs and corresponding properties are complex where causal substructures cannot fully interpret the labels. 3) the interactions between environments and invariances can influence with each other thus are challenging to be modeled. To this end, we propose a soft causal learning framework, to tackle the unresolved OOD challenge in molecular science, from the perspective of fully modeling the molecule environments and bypassing the invariant subgraphs. Specifically, we first incorporate chemistry theories into our graph growth generator to imitate expaned environments, and then devise an GIB-based objective to disentangle environment from whole graphs and finally introduce a cross-attention based soft causal interaction, which allows dynamic interactions between environments and invariances. We perform experiments on seven datasets by imitating different kinds of OOD generalization scenarios. Extensive comparison, ablation experiments as well as visualized case studies demonstrate well generalization ability of our proposal.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06283v1
Investigating Active Sampling for Hardness Classification with   Vision-Based Tactile Sensors,"One of the most important object properties that humans and robots perceive through touch is hardness. This paper investigates information-theoretic active sampling strategies for sample-efficient hardness classification with vision-based tactile sensors. We evaluate three probabilistic classifier models and two model-uncertainty-based sampling strategies on a robotic setup as well as on a previously published dataset of samples collected by human testers. Our findings indicate that the active sampling approaches, driven by uncertainty metrics, surpass a random sampling baseline in terms of accuracy and stability. Additionally, while in our human study, the participants achieve an average accuracy of 48.00%, our best approach achieves an average accuracy of 88.78% on the same set of objects, demonstrating the effectiveness of vision-based tactile sensors for object hardness classification.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13231v1
MINGLE: Mixtures of Null-Space Gated Low-Rank Experts for Test-Time   Continual Model Merging,"Continual model merging integrates independently fine-tuned models sequentially without access to original training data, providing a scalable and efficient solution to continual learning. However, current methods still face critical challenges, notably parameter interference among tasks and limited adaptability to evolving test distributions. The former causes catastrophic forgetting of integrated tasks, while the latter hinders effective adaptation to new tasks. To address these, we propose MINGLE, a novel framework for test-time continual model merging, which leverages test-time adaptation using a small set of unlabeled test samples from the current task to dynamically guide the merging process. MINGLE employs a mixture-of-experts architecture composed of parameter-efficient, low-rank experts, enabling efficient adaptation and improving robustness to distribution shifts. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we propose Null-Space Constrained Gating, which restricts gating updates to subspaces orthogonal to prior task representations. This suppresses activations on old task inputs and preserves model behavior on past tasks. To further balance stability and adaptability, we design an Adaptive Relaxation Strategy, which dynamically adjusts the constraint strength based on interference signals captured during test-time adaptation. Extensive experiments on standard continual merging benchmarks demonstrate that MINGLE achieves robust generalization, reduces forgetting significantly, and consistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods by 7-9\% on average across diverse task orders.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11883v1
Learning Stochastic Thermodynamics Directly from Correlation and   Trajectory-Fluctuation Currents,"Markedly increased computational power and data acquisition have led to growing interest in data-driven inverse dynamics problems. These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19007v1
UFO-RL: Uncertainty-Focused Optimization for Efficient Reinforcement   Learning Data Selection,"Scaling RL for LLMs is computationally expensive, largely due to multi-sampling for policy optimization and evaluation, making efficient data selection crucial. Inspired by the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory, we hypothesize LLMs learn best from data within their potential comprehension zone. Addressing the limitation of conventional, computationally intensive multi-sampling methods for data assessment, we introduce UFO-RL. This novel framework uses a computationally efficient single-pass uncertainty estimation to identify informative data instances, achieving up to 185x faster data evaluation. UFO-RL leverages this metric to select data within the estimated ZPD for training. Experiments show that training with just 10% of data selected by UFO-RL yields performance comparable to or surpassing full-data training, reducing overall training time by up to 16x while enhancing stability and generalization. UFO-RL offers a practical and highly efficient strategy for scaling RL fine-tuning of LLMs by focusing learning on valuable data.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12457v1
Wide & Deep Learning for Node Classification,"Wide & Deep, a simple yet effective learning architecture for recommendation systems developed by Google, has had a significant impact in both academia and industry due to its combination of the memorization ability of generalized linear models and the generalization ability of deep models. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) remain dominant in node classification tasks; however, recent studies have highlighted issues such as heterophily and expressiveness, which focus on graph structure while seemingly neglecting the potential role of node features. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework GCNIII, which leverages the Wide & Deep architecture and incorporates three techniques: Intersect memory, Initial residual and Identity mapping. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that GCNIII can more effectively balance the trade-off between over-fitting and over-generalization on various semi- and full- supervised tasks. Additionally, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for node feature engineering to enhance the performance of GCNIII in cross-domain node classification tasks. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/CYCUCAS/GCNIII.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02020v1
A Connection Between Learning to Reject and Bhattacharyya Divergences,"Learning to reject provide a learning paradigm which allows for our models to abstain from making predictions. One way to learn the rejector is to learn an ideal marginal distribution (w.r.t. the input domain) - which characterizes a hypothetical best marginal distribution - and compares it to the true marginal distribution via a density ratio. In this paper, we consider learning a joint ideal distribution over both inputs and labels; and develop a link between rejection and thresholding different statistical divergences. We further find that when one considers a variant of the log-loss, the rejector obtained by considering the joint ideal distribution corresponds to the thresholding of the skewed Bhattacharyya divergence between class-probabilities. This is in contrast to the marginal case - that is equivalent to a typical characterization of optimal rejection, Chow's Rule - which corresponds to a thresholding of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In general, we find that rejecting via a Bhattacharyya divergence is less aggressive than Chow's Rule.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05273v1
Representing spherical tensors with scalar-based machine-learning models,"Rotational symmetry plays a central role in physics, providing an elegant framework to describe how the properties of 3D objects -- from atoms to the macroscopic scale -- transform under the action of rigid rotations. Equivariant models of 3D point clouds are able to approximate structure-property relations in a way that is fully consistent with the structure of the rotation group, by combining intermediate representations that are themselves spherical tensors. The symmetry constraints however make this approach computationally demanding and cumbersome to implement, which motivates increasingly popular unconstrained architectures that learn approximate symmetries as part of the training process. In this work, we explore a third route to tackle this learning problem, where equivariant functions are expressed as the product of a scalar function of the point cloud coordinates and a small basis of tensors with the appropriate symmetry. We also propose approximations of the general expressions that, while lacking universal approximation properties, are fast, simple to implement, and accurate in practical settings.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05404v1
Evolution of Gaussians in the Hellinger-Kantorovich-Boltzmann gradient   flow,"This study leverages the basic insight that the gradient-flow equation associated with the relative Boltzmann entropy, in relation to a Gaussian reference measure within the Hellinger-Kantorovich (HK) geometry, preserves the class of Gaussian measures. This invariance serves as the foundation for constructing a reduced gradient structure on the parameter space characterizing Gaussian densities. We derive explicit ordinary differential equations that govern the evolution of mean, covariance, and mass under the HK-Boltzmann gradient flow. The reduced structure retains the additive form of the HK metric, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics involved.   We explore the geodesic convexity of the reduced system, revealing that global convexity is confined to the pure transport scenario, while a variant of sublevel semi-convexity is observed in the general case. Furthermore, we demonstrate exponential convergence to equilibrium through Polyak-Lojasiewicz-type inequalities, applicable both globally and on sublevel sets. By monitoring the evolution of covariance eigenvalues, we refine the decay rates associated with convergence. Additionally, we extend our analysis to non-Gaussian targets exhibiting strong log-lambda-concavity, corroborating our theoretical results with numerical experiments that encompass a Gaussian-target gradient flow and a Bayesian logistic regression application.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20400v1
Simplicity is Key: An Unsupervised Pretraining Approach for Sparse Radio   Channels,"We introduce the Sparse pretrained Radio Transformer (SpaRTran), an unsupervised representation learning approach based on the concept of compressed sensing for radio channels. Our approach learns embeddings that focus on the physical properties of radio propagation, to create the optimal basis for fine-tuning on radio-based downstream tasks. SpaRTran uses a sparse gated autoencoder that induces a simplicity bias to the learned representations, resembling the sparse nature of radio propagation. For signal reconstruction, it learns a dictionary that holds atomic features, which increases flexibility across signal waveforms and spatiotemporal signal patterns. Our experiments show that SpaRTran reduces errors by up to 85 % compared to state-of-the-art methods when fine-tuned on radio fingerprinting, a challenging downstream task. In addition, our method requires less pretraining effort and offers greater flexibility, as we train it solely on individual radio signals. SpaRTran serves as an excellent base model that can be fine-tuned for various radio-based downstream tasks, effectively reducing the cost for labeling. In addition, it is significantly more versatile than existing methods and demonstrates superior generalization.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13055v1
Learning cardiac activation and repolarization times with operator   learning,"Solving partial or ordinary differential equation models in cardiac electrophysiology is a computationally demanding task, particularly when high-resolution meshes are required to capture the complex dynamics of the heart. Moreover, in clinical applications, it is essential to employ computational tools that provide only relevant information, ensuring clarity and ease of interpretation. In this work, we exploit two recently proposed operator learning approaches, namely Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and Kernel Operator Learning (KOL), to learn the operator mapping the applied stimulus in the physical domain into the activation and repolarization time distributions. These data-driven methods are evaluated on synthetic 2D and 3D domains, as well as on a physiologically realistic left ventricle geometry. Notably, while the learned map between the applied current and activation time has its modelling counterpart in the Eikonal model, no equivalent partial differential equation (PDE) model is known for the map between the applied current and repolarization time. Our results demonstrate that both FNO and KOL approaches are robust to hyperparameter choices and computationally efficient compared to traditional PDE-based Monodomain models. These findings highlight the potential use of these surrogate operators to accelerate cardiac simulations and facilitate their clinical integration.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08631v1
A New Approach to Backtracking Counterfactual Explanations: A Causal   Framework for Efficient Model Interpretability,"Counterfactual explanations enhance interpretability by identifying alternative inputs that produce different outputs, offering localized insights into model decisions. However, traditional methods often neglect causal relationships, leading to unrealistic examples. While newer approaches integrate causality, they are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient method based on backtracking counterfactuals that incorporates causal reasoning to generate actionable explanations. We first examine the limitations of existing methods and then introduce our novel approach and its features. We also explore the relationship between our method and previous techniques, demonstrating that it generalizes them in specific scenarios. Finally, experiments show that our method provides deeper insights into model outputs.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02435v1
Lower Bounds on the MMSE of Adversarially Inferring Sensitive Features,"We propose an adversarial evaluation framework for sensitive feature inference based on minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation with a finite sample size and linear predictive models. Our approach establishes theoretical lower bounds on the true MMSE of inferring sensitive features from noisy observations of other correlated features. These bounds are expressed in terms of the empirical MMSE under a restricted hypothesis class and a non-negative error term. The error term captures both the estimation error due to finite number of samples and the approximation error from using a restricted hypothesis class. For linear predictive models, we derive closed-form bounds, which are order optimal in terms of the noise variance, on the approximation error for several classes of relationships between the sensitive and non-sensitive features, including linear mappings, binary symmetric channels, and class-conditional multi-variate Gaussian distributions. We also present a new lower bound that relies on the MSE computed on a hold-out validation dataset of the MMSE estimator learned on finite-samples and a restricted hypothesis class. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our framework serves as an effective tool for MMSE-based adversarial evaluation of sensitive feature inference that balances theoretical guarantees with practical efficiency.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09004v1
Restoration Score Distillation: From Corrupted Diffusion Pretraining to   One-Step High-Quality Generation,"Learning generative models from corrupted data is a fundamental yet persistently challenging task across scientific disciplines, particularly when access to clean data is limited or expensive. Denoising Score Distillation (DSD) \cite{chen2025denoising} recently introduced a novel and surprisingly effective strategy that leverages score distillation to train high-fidelity generative models directly from noisy observations. Building upon this foundation, we propose \textit{Restoration Score Distillation} (RSD), a principled generalization of DSD that accommodates a broader range of corruption types, such as blurred, incomplete, or low-resolution images. RSD operates by first pretraining a teacher diffusion model solely on corrupted data and subsequently distilling it into a single-step generator that produces high-quality reconstructions. Empirically, RSD consistently surpasses its teacher model across diverse restoration tasks on both natural and scientific datasets. Moreover, beyond standard diffusion objectives, the RSD framework is compatible with several corruption-aware training techniques such as Ambient Tweedie, Ambient Diffusion, and its Fourier-space variant, enabling flexible integration with recent advances in diffusion modeling. Theoretically, we demonstrate that in a linear regime, RSD recovers the eigenspace of the clean data covariance matrix from linear measurements, thereby serving as an implicit regularizer. This interpretation recasts score distillation not only as a sampling acceleration technique but as a principled approach to enhancing generative performance in severely degraded data regimes.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13377v1
Model Steering: Learning with a Reference Model Improves Generalization   Bounds and Scaling Laws,"This paper formalizes an emerging learning paradigm that uses a trained model as a reference to guide and enhance the training of a target model through strategic data selection or weighting, named $\textbf{model steering}$. While ad-hoc methods have been used in various contexts, including the training of large foundation models, its underlying principles remain insufficiently understood, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we propose a theory-driven framework for model steering called $\textbf{DRRho risk minimization}$, which is rooted in Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO). Through a generalization analysis, we provide theoretical insights into why this approach improves generalization and data efficiency compared to training without a reference model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such theoretical insights are provided for the new learning paradigm, which significantly enhance our understanding and practice of model steering. Building on these insights and the connection between contrastive learning and DRO, we introduce a novel method for Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) with a reference model, termed DRRho-CLIP. Extensive experiments validate the theoretical insights, reveal a superior scaling law compared to CLIP without a reference model, and demonstrate its strength over existing heuristic approaches.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06699v3
Generalization Bounds and Stopping Rules for Learning with Self-Selected   Data,"Many learning paradigms self-select training data in light of previously learned parameters. Examples include active learning, semi-supervised learning, bandits, or boosting. Rodemann et al. (2024) unify them under the framework of ""reciprocal learning"". In this article, we address the question of how well these methods can generalize from their self-selected samples. In particular, we prove universal generalization bounds for reciprocal learning using covering numbers and Wasserstein ambiguity sets. Our results require no assumptions on the distribution of self-selected data, only verifiable conditions on the algorithms. We prove results for both convergent and finite iteration solutions. The latter are anytime valid, thereby giving rise to stopping rules for a practitioner seeking to guarantee the out-of-sample performance of their reciprocal learning algorithm. Finally, we illustrate our bounds and stopping rules for reciprocal learning's special case of semi-supervised learning.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07367v1
Modelling higher education dropouts using sparse and interpretable   post-clustering logistic regression,"Higher education dropout constitutes a critical challenge for tertiary education systems worldwide. While machine learning techniques can achieve high predictive accuracy on selected datasets, their adoption by policymakers remains limited and unsatisfactory, particularly when the objective is the unsupervised identification and characterization of student subgroups at elevated risk of dropout. The model introduced in this paper is a specialized form of logistic regression, specifically adapted to the context of university dropout analysis. Logistic regression continues to serve as a foundational tool among reliable statistical models, primarily due to the ease with which its parameters can be interpreted in terms of odds ratios. Our approach significantly extends this framework by incorporating heterogeneity within the student population. This is achieved through the application of a preliminary clustering algorithm that identifies latent subgroups, each characterized by distinct dropout propensities, which are then modeled via cluster-specific effects. We provide a detailed interpretation of the model parameters within this extended framework and enhance interpretability by imposing sparsity through a tailored variant of the LASSO algorithm. To demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed methodology, we present an extensive case study based on the Italian university system, in which all the developed tools are systematically applied",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07582v1
GEM: Gaussian Embedding Modeling for Out-of-Distribution Detection in   GUI Agents,"Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have recently emerged as an intriguing paradigm for human-computer interaction, capable of automatically executing user instructions to operate intelligent terminal devices. However, when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) instructions that violate environmental constraints or exceed the current capabilities of agents, GUI agents may suffer task breakdowns or even pose security threats. Therefore, effective OOD detection for GUI agents is essential. Traditional OOD detection methods perform suboptimally in this domain due to the complex embedding space and evolving GUI environments. In this work, we observe that the in-distribution input semantic space of GUI agents exhibits a clustering pattern with respect to the distance from the centroid. Based on the finding, we propose GEM, a novel method based on fitting a Gaussian mixture model over input embedding distances extracted from the GUI Agent that reflect its capability boundary. Evaluated on eight datasets spanning smartphones, computers, and web browsers, our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 23.70\% over the best-performing baseline. Analysis verifies the generalization ability of our method through experiments on nine different backbones. The codes are available at https://github.com/Wuzheng02/GEM-OODforGUIagents.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12842v1
IIKL: Isometric Immersion Kernel Learning with Riemannian Manifold for   Geometric Preservation,"Geometric representation learning in preserving the intrinsic geometric and topological properties for discrete non-Euclidean data is crucial in scientific applications. Previous research generally mapped non-Euclidean discrete data into Euclidean space during representation learning, which may lead to the loss of some critical geometric information. In this paper, we propose a novel Isometric Immersion Kernel Learning (IIKL) method to build Riemannian manifold and isometrically induce Riemannian metric from discrete non-Euclidean data. We prove that Isometric immersion is equivalent to the kernel function in the tangent bundle on the manifold, which explicitly guarantees the invariance of the inner product between vectors in the arbitrary tangent space throughout the learning process, thus maintaining the geometric structure of the original data. Moreover, a novel parameterized learning model based on IIKL is introduced, and an alternating training method for this model is derived using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), ensuring efficient convergence. Experimental results proved that using the learned Riemannian manifold and its metric, our model preserved the intrinsic geometric representation of data in both 3D and high-dimensional datasets successfully, and significantly improved the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as data reconstruction and classification. It is showed that our method could reduce the inner product invariant loss by more than 90% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, also achieved an average 40% improvement in downstream reconstruction accuracy and a 90% reduction in error for geometric metrics involving isometric and conformal.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06288v1
Ranked differences Pearson correlation dissimilarity with an application   to electricity users time series clustering,"Time series clustering is an unsupervised learning method for classifying time series data into groups with similar behavior. It is used in applications such as healthcare, finance, economics, energy, and climate science. Several time series clustering methods have been introduced and used for over four decades. Most of them focus on measuring either Euclidean distances or association dissimilarities between time series. In this work, we propose a new dissimilarity measure called ranked Pearson correlation dissimilarity (RDPC), which combines a weighted average of a specified fraction of the largest element-wise differences with the well-known Pearson correlation dissimilarity. It is incorporated into hierarchical clustering. The performance is evaluated and compared with existing clustering algorithms. The results show that the RDPC algorithm outperforms others in complicated cases involving different seasonal patterns, trends, and peaks. Finally, we demonstrate our method by clustering a random sample of customers from a Thai electricity consumption time series dataset into seven groups with unique characteristics.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02173v2
What's Wrong with Your Synthetic Tabular Data? Using Explainable AI to   Evaluate Generative Models,"Evaluating synthetic tabular data is challenging, since they can differ from the real data in so many ways. There exist numerous metrics of synthetic data quality, ranging from statistical distances to predictive performance, often providing conflicting results. Moreover, they fail to explain or pinpoint the specific weaknesses in the synthetic data. To address this, we apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques to a binary detection classifier trained to distinguish real from synthetic data. While the classifier identifies distributional differences, XAI concepts such as feature importance and feature effects, analyzed through methods like permutation feature importance, partial dependence plots, Shapley values and counterfactual explanations, reveal why synthetic data are distinguishable, highlighting inconsistencies, unrealistic dependencies, or missing patterns. This interpretability increases transparency in synthetic data evaluation and provides deeper insights beyond conventional metrics, helping diagnose and improve synthetic data quality. We apply our approach to two tabular datasets and generative models, showing that it uncovers issues overlooked by standard evaluation techniques.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20687v1
Mixed-Integer Optimization for Responsible Machine Learning,"In the last few decades, Machine Learning (ML) has achieved significant success across domains ranging from healthcare, sustainability, and the social sciences, to criminal justice and finance. But its deployment in increasingly sophisticated, critical, and sensitive areas affecting individuals, the groups they belong to, and society as a whole raises critical concerns around fairness, transparency, robustness, and privacy, among others. As the complexity and scale of ML systems and of the settings in which they are deployed grow, so does the need for responsible ML methods that address these challenges while providing guaranteed performance in deployment.   Mixed-integer optimization (MIO) offers a powerful framework for embedding responsible ML considerations directly into the learning process while maintaining performance. For example, it enables learning of inherently transparent models that can conveniently incorporate fairness or other domain specific constraints. This tutorial paper provides an accessible and comprehensive introduction to this topic discussing both theoretical and practical aspects. It outlines some of the core principles of responsible ML, their importance in applications, and the practical utility of MIO for building ML models that align with these principles. Through examples and mathematical formulations, it illustrates practical strategies and available tools for efficiently solving MIO problems for responsible ML. It concludes with a discussion on current limitations and open research questions, providing suggestions for future work.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05857v1
Beyond $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ Constraint Violation for Online Convex   Optimization with Adversarial Constraints,"We revisit the Online Convex Optimization problem with adversarial constraints (COCO) where, in each round, a learner is presented with a convex cost function and a convex constraint function, both of which may be chosen adversarially. The learner selects actions from a convex decision set in an online fashion, with the goal of minimizing both regret and the cumulative constraint violation (CCV) over a horizon of $T$ rounds. The best-known policy for this problem achieves $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ CCV. In this paper, we present a surprising improvement that achieves a significantly smaller CCV by trading it off with regret. Specifically, for any bounded convex cost and constraint functions, we propose an online policy that achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dT}+ T^\beta)$ regret and $\tilde{O}(dT^{1-\beta})$ CCV, where $d$ is the dimension of the decision set and $\beta \in [0,1]$ is a tunable parameter. We achieve this result by first considering the special case of $\textsf{Constrained Expert}$ problem where the decision set is a probability simplex and the cost and constraint functions are linear. Leveraging a new adaptive small-loss regret bound, we propose an efficient policy for the $\textsf{Constrained Expert}$ problem, that attains $O(\sqrt{T\ln N}+T^{\beta})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\beta} \ln N)$ CCV, where $N$ is the number of experts. The original problem is then reduced to the $\textsf{Constrained Expert}$ problem via a covering argument. Finally, with an additional smoothness assumption, we propose an efficient gradient-based policy attaining $O(T^{\max(\frac{1}{2},\beta)})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\beta})$ CCV.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06709v1
Gaussian Differential Private Bootstrap by Subsampling,"Bootstrap is a common tool for quantifying uncertainty in data analysis. However, besides additional computational costs in the application of the bootstrap on massive data, a challenging problem in bootstrap based inference under Differential Privacy consists in the fact that it requires repeated access to the data. As a consequence, bootstrap based differentially private inference requires a significant increase of the privacy budget, which on the other hand comes with a substantial loss in statistical accuracy.   A potential solution to reconcile the conflicting goals of statistical accuracy and privacy is to analyze the data under parametric model assumptions and in the last decade, several parametric bootstrap methods for inference under privacy have been investigated. However, uncertainty quantification by parametric bootstrap is only valid if the the quantities of interest can be identified as the parameters of a statistical model and the imposed model assumptions are (at least approximately) satisfied. An alternative to parametric methods is the empirical bootstrap that is a widely used tool for non-parametric inference and well studied in the non-private regime. However, under privacy, less insight is available. In this paper, we propose a private empirical $m$ out of $n$ bootstrap and validate its consistency and privacy guarantees under Gaussian Differential Privacy. Compared to the the private $n$ out of $n$ bootstrap, our approach has several advantages. First, it comes with less computational costs, in particular for massive data. Second, the proposed procedure needs less additional noise in the bootstrap iterations, which leads to an improved statistical accuracy while asymptotically guaranteeing the same level of privacy. Third, we demonstrate much better finite sample properties compared to the currently available procedures.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01197v1
UGoDIT: Unsupervised Group Deep Image Prior Via Transferable Weights,"Recent advances in data-centric deep generative models have led to significant progress in solving inverse imaging problems. However, these models (e.g., diffusion models (DMs)) typically require large amounts of fully sampled (clean) training data, which is often impractical in medical and scientific settings such as dynamic imaging.   On the other hand, training-data-free approaches like the Deep Image Prior (DIP) do not require clean ground-truth images but suffer from noise overfitting and can be computationally expensive as the network parameters need to be optimized for each measurement set independently. Moreover, DIP-based methods often overlook the potential of learning a prior using a small number of sub-sampled measurements (or degraded images) available during training. In this paper, we propose UGoDIT, an Unsupervised Group DIP via Transferable weights, designed for the low-data regime where only a very small number, M, of sub-sampled measurement vectors are available during training. Our method learns a set of transferable weights by optimizing a shared encoder and M disentangled decoders. At test time, we reconstruct the unseen degraded image using a DIP network, where part of the parameters are fixed to the learned weights, while the remaining are optimized to enforce measurement consistency. We evaluate UGoDIT on both medical (multi-coil MRI) and natural (super resolution and non-linear deblurring) image recovery tasks under various settings. Compared to recent standalone DIP methods, UGoDIT provides accelerated convergence and notable improvement in reconstruction quality. Furthermore, our method achieves performance competitive with SOTA DM-based and supervised approaches, despite not requiring large amounts of clean training data.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11720v1
"Estimation of discrete distributions in relative entropy, and the   deviations of the missing mass","We study the problem of estimating a distribution over a finite alphabet from an i.i.d. sample, with accuracy measured in relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence). While optimal expected risk bounds are known, high-probability guarantees remain less well-understood. First, we analyze the classical Laplace (add-$1$) estimator, obtaining matching upper and lower bounds on its performance and showing its optimality among confidence-independent estimators. We then characterize the minimax-optimal high-probability risk achievable by any estimator, which is attained via a simple confidence-dependent smoothing technique. Interestingly, the optimal non-asymptotic risk contains an additional logarithmic factor over the ideal asymptotic risk. Next, motivated by scenarios where the alphabet exceeds the sample size, we investigate methods that adapt to the sparsity of the distribution at hand. We introduce an estimator using data-dependent smoothing, for which we establish a high-probability risk bound depending on two effective sparsity parameters. As part of the analysis, we also derive a sharp high-probability upper bound on the missing mass.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21787v1
Actor-Critics Can Achieve Optimal Sample Efficiency,"Actor-critic algorithms have become a cornerstone in reinforcement learning (RL), leveraging the strengths of both policy-based and value-based methods. Despite recent progress in understanding their statistical efficiency, no existing work has successfully learned an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with a sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ trajectories with general function approximation when strategic exploration is necessary.   We address this open problem by introducing a novel actor-critic algorithm that attains a sample-complexity of $O(dH^5 \log|\mathcal{A}|/\epsilon^2 + d H^4 \log|\mathcal{F}|/ \epsilon^2)$ trajectories, and accompanying $\sqrt{T}$ regret when the Bellman eluder dimension $d$ does not increase with $T$ at more than a $\log T$ rate.   Here, $\mathcal{F}$ is the critic function class, $\mathcal{A}$ is the action space, and $H$ is the horizon in the finite horizon MDP setting. Our algorithm integrates optimism, off-policy critic estimation targeting the optimal Q-function, and rare-switching policy resets.   We extend this to the setting of Hybrid RL, showing that initializing the critic with offline data yields sample efficiency gains compared to purely offline or online RL. Further, utilizing access to offline data, we provide a \textit{non-optimistic} provably efficient actor-critic algorithm that only additionally requires $N_{\text{off}} \geq c_{\text{off}}^*dH^4/\epsilon^2$ in exchange for omitting optimism, where $c_{\text{off}}^*$ is the single-policy concentrability coefficient and $N_{\text{off}}$ is the number of offline samples. This addresses another open problem in the literature. We further provide numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03710v1
Parameter Efficient Continual Learning with Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation,"Catastrophic forgetting has remained a critical challenge for deep neural networks in Continual Learning (CL) as it undermines consolidated knowledge when learning new tasks. Parameter efficient fine tuning CL techniques are gaining traction for their effectiveness in addressing catastrophic forgetting with a lightweight training schedule while avoiding degradation of consolidated knowledge in pre-trained models. However, low rank adapters (LoRA) in these approaches are highly sensitive to rank selection which can lead to sub-optimal resource allocation and performance. To this end, we introduce PEARL, a rehearsal-free CL framework that entails dynamic rank allocation for LoRA components during CL training. Specifically, PEARL leverages reference task weights and adaptively determines the rank of task-specific LoRA components based on the current tasks' proximity to reference task weights in parameter space. To demonstrate the versatility of PEARL, we evaluate it across three vision architectures (ResNet, Separable Convolutional Network and Vision Transformer) and a multitude of CL scenarios, and show that PEARL outperforms all considered baselines by a large margin.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11998v1
Multi-site modelling and reconstruction of past extreme skew surges   along the French Atlantic coast,"Appropriate modelling of extreme skew surges is crucial, particularly for coastal risk management. Our study focuses on modelling extreme skew surges along the French Atlantic coast, with a particular emphasis on investigating the extremal dependence structure between stations. We employ the peak-over-threshold framework, where a multivariate extreme event is defined whenever at least one location records a large value, though not necessarily all stations simultaneously. A novel method for determining an appropriate level (threshold) above which observations can be classified as extreme is proposed. Two complementary approaches are explored. First, the multivariate generalized Pareto distribution is employed to model extremes, leveraging its properties to derive a generative model that predicts extreme skew surges at one station based on observed extremes at nearby stations. Second, a novel extreme regression framework is assessed for point predictions. This specific regression framework enables accurate point predictions using only the ""angle"" of input variables, i.e. input variables divided by their norms. The ultimate objective is to reconstruct historical skew surge time series at stations with limited data. This is achieved by integrating extreme skew surge data from stations with longer records, such as Brest and Saint-Nazaire, which provide over 150 years of observations.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00835v1
Extreme Conformal Prediction: Reliable Intervals for High-Impact Events,"Conformal prediction is a popular method to construct prediction intervals for black-box machine learning models with marginal coverage guarantees. In applications with potentially high-impact events, such as flooding or financial crises, regulators often require very high confidence for such intervals. However, if the desired level of confidence is too large relative to the amount of data used for calibration, then classical conformal methods provide infinitely wide, thus, uninformative prediction intervals. In this paper, we propose a new method to overcome this limitation. We bridge extreme value statistics and conformal prediction to provide reliable and informative prediction intervals with high-confidence coverage, which can be constructed using any black-box extreme quantile regression method. The advantages of this extreme conformal prediction method are illustrated in a simulation study and in an application to flood risk forecasting.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08578v1
Stability Regularized Cross-Validation,"We revisit the problem of ensuring strong test-set performance via cross-validation. Motivated by the generalization theory literature, we propose a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme that selects hyperparameters by minimizing a weighted sum of the usual cross-validation metric and an empirical model-stability measure. The weight on the stability term is itself chosen via a nested cross-validation procedure. This reduces the risk of strong validation set performance and poor test set performance due to instability. We benchmark our procedure on a suite of 13 real-world UCI datasets, and find that, compared to k-fold cross-validation over the same hyperparameters, it improves the out-of-sample MSE for sparse ridge regression and CART by 4% on average, but has no impact on XGBoost. This suggests that for interpretable and unstable models, such as sparse regression and CART, our approach is a viable and computationally affordable method for improving test-set performance.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06927v1
Forests for Differences: Robust Causal Inference Beyond Parametric DiD,"This paper introduces the Difference-in-Differences Bayesian Causal Forest (DiD-BCF), a novel non-parametric model addressing key challenges in DiD estimation, such as staggered adoption and heterogeneous treatment effects. DiD-BCF provides a unified framework for estimating Average (ATE), Group-Average (GATE), and Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE). A core innovation, its Parallel Trends Assumption (PTA)-based reparameterization, enhances estimation accuracy and stability in complex panel data settings. Extensive simulations demonstrate DiD-BCF's superior performance over established benchmarks, particularly under non-linearity, selection biases, and effect heterogeneity. Applied to U.S. minimum wage policy, the model uncovers significant conditional treatment effect heterogeneity related to county population, insights obscured by traditional methods. DiD-BCF offers a robust and versatile tool for more nuanced causal inference in modern DiD applications.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09706v1
GeoERM: Geometry-Aware Multi-Task Representation Learning on Riemannian   Manifolds,"Multi-Task Learning (MTL) seeks to boost statistical power and learning efficiency by discovering structure shared across related tasks. State-of-the-art MTL representation methods, however, usually treat the latent representation matrix as a point in ordinary Euclidean space, ignoring its often non-Euclidean geometry, thus sacrificing robustness when tasks are heterogeneous or even adversarial. We propose GeoERM, a geometry-aware MTL framework that embeds the shared representation on its natural Riemannian manifold and optimizes it via explicit manifold operations. Each training cycle performs (i) a Riemannian gradient step that respects the intrinsic curvature of the search space, followed by (ii) an efficient polar retraction to remain on the manifold, guaranteeing geometric fidelity at every iteration. The procedure applies to a broad class of matrix-factorized MTL models and retains the same per-iteration cost as Euclidean baselines. Across a set of synthetic experiments with task heterogeneity and on a wearable-sensor activity-recognition benchmark, GeoERM consistently improves estimation accuracy, reduces negative transfer, and remains stable under adversarial label noise, outperforming leading MTL and single-task alternatives.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02972v1
HAKES: Scalable Vector Database for Embedding Search Service,"Modern deep learning models capture the semantics of complex data by transforming them into high-dimensional embedding vectors. Emerging applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation, use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in the embedding vector space to find similar data. Existing vector databases provide indexes for efficient ANN searches, with graph-based indexes being the most popular due to their low latency and high recall in real-world high-dimensional datasets. However, these indexes are costly to build, suffer from significant contention under concurrent read-write workloads, and scale poorly to multiple servers.   Our goal is to build a vector database that achieves high throughput and high recall under concurrent read-write workloads. To this end, we first propose an ANN index with an explicit two-stage design combining a fast filter stage with highly compressed vectors and a refine stage to ensure recall, and we devise a novel lightweight machine learning technique to fine-tune the index parameters. We introduce an early termination check to dynamically adapt the search process for each query. Next, we add support for writes while maintaining search performance by decoupling the management of the learned parameters. Finally, we design HAKES, a distributed vector database that serves the new index in a disaggregated architecture. We evaluate our index and system against 12 state-of-the-art indexes and three distributed vector databases, using high-dimensional embedding datasets generated by deep learning models. The experimental results show that our index outperforms index baselines in the high recall region and under concurrent read-write workloads. Furthermore, \namesys{} is scalable and achieves up to $16\times$ higher throughputs than the baselines. The HAKES project is open-sourced at https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dbsystem/hakes/.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12524v1
From Two Sample Testing to Singular Gaussian Discrimination,"We establish that testing for the equality of two probability measures on a general separable and compact metric space is equivalent to testing for the singularity between two corresponding Gaussian measures on a suitable Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. The corresponding Gaussians are defined via the notion of kernel mean and covariance embedding of a probability measure. Discerning two singular Gaussians is fundamentally simpler from an information-theoretic perspective than non-parametric two-sample testing, particularly in high-dimensional settings. Our proof leverages the Feldman-Hajek criterion for singularity/equivalence of Gaussians on Hilbert spaces, and shows that discrepancies between distributions are heavily magnified through their corresponding Gaussian embeddings: at a population level, distinct probability measures lead to essentially separated Gaussian embeddings. This appears to be a new instance of the blessing of dimensionality that can be harnessed for the design of efficient inference tools in great generality.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04613v1
PIF: Anomaly detection via preference embedding,"We address the problem of detecting anomalies with respect to structured patterns. To this end, we conceive a novel anomaly detection method called PIF, that combines the advantages of adaptive isolation methods with the flexibility of preference embedding. Specifically, we propose to embed the data in a high dimensional space where an efficient tree-based method, PI-Forest, is employed to compute an anomaly score. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that PIF favorably compares with state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques, and confirm that PI-Forest is better at measuring arbitrary distances and isolate points in the preference space.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10441v1
Few-Step Diffusion via Score identity Distillation,"Diffusion distillation has emerged as a promising strategy for accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by distilling a pretrained score network into a one- or few-step generator. While existing methods have made notable progress, they often rely on real or teacher-synthesized images to perform well when distilling high-resolution T2I diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), and their use of classifier-free guidance (CFG) introduces a persistent trade-off between text-image alignment and generation diversity. We address these challenges by optimizing Score identity Distillation (SiD) -- a data-free, one-step distillation framework -- for few-step generation. Backed by theoretical analysis that justifies matching a uniform mixture of outputs from all generation steps to the data distribution, our few-step distillation algorithm avoids step-specific networks and integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art performance on SDXL at 1024x1024 resolution. To mitigate the alignment-diversity trade-off when real text-image pairs are available, we introduce a Diffusion GAN-based adversarial loss applied to the uniform mixture and propose two new guidance strategies: Zero-CFG, which disables CFG in the teacher and removes text conditioning in the fake score network, and Anti-CFG, which applies negative CFG in the fake score network. This flexible setup improves diversity without sacrificing alignment. Comprehensive experiments on SD1.5 and SDXL demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both one-step and few-step generation settings, along with robustness to the absence of real images. Our efficient PyTorch implementation, along with the resulting one- and few-step distilled generators, will be released publicly as a separate branch at https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD-LSG.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12674v1
GraphFLEx: Structure Learning Framework for Large Expanding Graphs,"Graph structure learning is a core problem in graph-based machine learning, essential for uncovering latent relationships and ensuring model interpretability. However, most existing approaches are ill-suited for large-scale and dynamically evolving graphs, as they often require complete re-learning of the structure upon the arrival of new nodes and incur substantial computational and memory costs. In this work, we propose GraphFLEx: a unified and scalable framework for Graph Structure Learning in Large and Expanding Graphs. GraphFLEx mitigates the scalability bottlenecks by restricting edge formation to structurally relevant subsets of nodes identified through a combination of clustering and coarsening techniques. This dramatically reduces the search space and enables efficient, incremental graph updates. The framework supports 48 flexible configurations by integrating diverse choices of learning paradigms, coarsening strategies, and clustering methods, making it adaptable to a wide range of graph settings and learning objectives. Extensive experiments across 26 diverse datasets and Graph Neural Network architectures demonstrate that GraphFLEx achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved scalability.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12323v1
Wasserstein-Aitchison GAN for angular measures of multivariate extremes,"Economically responsible mitigation of multivariate extreme risks -- extreme rainfall in a large area, huge variations of many stock prices, widespread breakdowns in transportation systems -- requires estimates of the probabilities that such risks will materialize in the future. This paper develops a new method, Wasserstein--Aitchison Generative Adversarial Networks (WA-GAN), which provides simulated values of future $d$-dimensional multivariate extreme events and which hence can be used to give estimates of such probabilities. The main hypothesis is that, after transforming the observations to the unit-Pareto scale, their distribution is regularly varying in the sense that the distributions of their radial and angular components (with respect to the $L_1$-norm) converge and become asymptotically independent as the radius gets large. The method is a combination of standard extreme value analysis modeling of the tails of the marginal distributions with nonparametric GAN modeling of the angular distribution. For the latter, the angular values are transformed to Aitchison coordinates in a full $(d-1)$-dimensional linear space, and a Wasserstein GAN is trained on these coordinates and used to generate new values. A reverse transformation is then applied to these values and gives simulated values on the original data scale. The method shows good performance compared to other existing methods in the literature, both in terms of capturing the dependence structure of the extremes in the data, as well as in generating accurate new extremes of the data distribution. The comparison is performed on simulated multivariate extremes from a logistic model in dimensions up to 50 and on a 30-dimensional financial data set.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21438v1
Early Prediction of In-Hospital ICU Mortality Using Innovative First-Day   Data: A Review,"The intensive care unit (ICU) manages critically ill patients, many of whom face a high risk of mortality. Early and accurate prediction of in-hospital mortality within the first 24 hours of ICU admission is crucial for timely clinical interventions, resource optimization, and improved patient outcomes. Traditional scoring systems, while useful, often have limitations in predictive accuracy and adaptability. Objective: This review aims to systematically evaluate and benchmark innovative methodologies that leverage data available within the first day of ICU admission for predicting in-hospital mortality. We focus on advancements in machine learning, novel biomarker applications, and the integration of diverse data types.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12344v1
HybridServe: Efficient Serving of Large AI Models with Confidence-Based   Cascade Routing,"Giant Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have become indispensable for accurate and robust support of large-scale cloud based AI services. However, serving giant DNNs is prohibitively expensive from an energy consumption viewpoint easily exceeding that of training, due to the enormous scale of GPU clusters needed to hold giant DNN model partitions and replicas. Existing approaches can either optimize energy efficiency or inference accuracy but not both. To overcome this status quo, we propose HybridServe, a novel hybrid DNN model serving system that leverages multiple sized versions (small to giant) of the model to be served in tandem. Through a confidence based hybrid model serving dataflow, HybridServe prefers to serve inference requests with energy-efficient smaller models so long as accuracy is not compromised, thereby reducing the number of replicas needed for giant DNNs. HybridServe also features a dataflow planner for efficient partitioning and replication of candidate models to maximize serving system throughput. Experimental results using a prototype implementation of HybridServe show that it reduces energy footprint by up to 19.8x compared to the state-of-the-art DNN model serving systems while matching the accuracy of serving solely with giant DNNs.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12566v1
Towards DS-NER: Unveiling and Addressing Latent Noise in Distant   Annotations,"Distantly supervised named entity recognition (DS-NER) has emerged as a cheap and convenient alternative to traditional human annotation methods, enabling the automatic generation of training data by aligning text with external resources. Despite the many efforts in noise measurement methods, few works focus on the latent noise distribution between different distant annotation methods. In this work, we explore the effectiveness and robustness of DS-NER by two aspects: (1) distant annotation techniques, which encompasses both traditional rule-based methods and the innovative large language model supervision approach, and (2) noise assessment, for which we introduce a novel framework. This framework addresses the challenges by distinctly categorizing them into the unlabeled-entity problem (UEP) and the noisy-entity problem (NEP), subsequently providing specialized solutions for each. Our proposed method achieves significant improvements on eight real-world distant supervision datasets originating from three different data sources and involving four distinct annotation techniques, confirming its superiority over current state-of-the-art methods.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12454v1
Nonlinear Laplacians: Tunable principal component analysis under   directional prior information,"We introduce a new family of algorithms for detecting and estimating a rank-one signal from a noisy observation under prior information about that signal's direction, focusing on examples where the signal is known to have entries biased to be positive. Given a matrix observation $\mathbf{Y}$, our algorithms construct a nonlinear Laplacian, another matrix of the form $\mathbf{Y} + \mathrm{diag}(\sigma(\mathbf{Y}\mathbf{1}))$ for a nonlinear $\sigma: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, and examine the top eigenvalue and eigenvector of this matrix. When $\mathbf{Y}$ is the (suitably normalized) adjacency matrix of a graph, our approach gives a class of algorithms that search for unusually dense subgraphs by computing a spectrum of the graph ""deformed"" by the degree profile $\mathbf{Y}\mathbf{1}$. We study the performance of such algorithms compared to direct spectral algorithms (the case $\sigma = 0$) on models of sparse principal component analysis with biased signals, including the Gaussian planted submatrix problem. For such models, we rigorously characterize the critical threshold strength of rank-one signal, as a function of the nonlinearity $\sigma$, at which an outlier eigenvalue appears in the spectrum of a nonlinear Laplacian. While identifying the $\sigma$ that minimizes this critical signal strength in closed form seems intractable, we explore three approaches to design $\sigma$ numerically: exhaustively searching over simple classes of $\sigma$, learning $\sigma$ from datasets of problem instances, and tuning $\sigma$ using black-box optimization of the critical signal strength. We find both theoretically and empirically that, if $\sigma$ is chosen appropriately, then nonlinear Laplacian spectral algorithms substantially outperform direct spectral algorithms, while avoiding the complexity of broader classes of algorithms like approximate message passing or general first order methods.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12528v1
Modeling Nonstationary Extremal Dependence via Deep Spatial Deformations,"Modeling nonstationarity that often prevails in extremal dependence of spatial data can be challenging, and typically requires bespoke or complex spatial models that are difficult to estimate. Inference for stationary and isotropic models is considerably easier, but the assumptions that underpin these models are rarely met by data observed over large or topographically complex domains. A possible approach for accommodating nonstationarity in a spatial model is to warp the spatial domain to a latent space where stationarity and isotropy can be reasonably assumed. Although this approach is very flexible, estimating the warping function can be computationally expensive, and the transformation is not always guaranteed to be bijective, which may lead to physically unrealistic transformations when the domain folds onto itself. We overcome these challenges by developing deep compositional spatial models to capture nonstationarity in extremal dependence. Specifically, we focus on modeling high threshold exceedances of process functionals by leveraging efficient inference methods for limiting $r$-Pareto processes. A detailed high-dimensional simulation study demonstrates the superior performance of our model in estimating the warped space. We illustrate our method by modeling UK precipitation extremes and show that we can efficiently estimate the extremal dependence structure of data observed at thousands of locations.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12548v1
$γ$-FedHT: Stepsize-Aware Hard-Threshold Gradient Compression in   Federated Learning,"Gradient compression can effectively alleviate communication bottlenecks in Federated Learning (FL). Contemporary state-of-the-art sparse compressors, such as Top-$k$, exhibit high computational complexity, up to $\mathcal{O}(d\log_2{k})$, where $d$ is the number of model parameters. The hard-threshold compressor, which simply transmits elements with absolute values higher than a fixed threshold, is thus proposed to reduce the complexity to $\mathcal{O}(d)$. However, the hard-threshold compression causes accuracy degradation in FL, where the datasets are non-IID and the stepsize $\gamma$ is decreasing for model convergence. The decaying stepsize reduces the updates and causes the compression ratio of the hard-threshold compression to drop rapidly to an aggressive ratio. At or below this ratio, the model accuracy has been observed to degrade severely. To address this, we propose $\gamma$-FedHT, a stepsize-aware low-cost compressor with Error-Feedback to guarantee convergence. Given that the traditional theoretical framework of FL does not consider Error-Feedback, we introduce the fundamental conversation of Error-Feedback. We prove that $\gamma$-FedHT has the convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{T})$ ($T$ representing total training iterations) under $\mu$-strongly convex cases and $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$ under non-convex cases, \textit{same as FedAVG}. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\gamma$-FedHT improves accuracy by up to $7.42\%$ over Top-$k$ under equal communication traffic on various non-IID image datasets.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12479v1
Resolving Memorization in Empirical Diffusion Model for Manifold Data in   High-Dimensional Spaces,"Diffusion models is a popular computational tool to generate new data samples. It utilizes a forward diffusion process that add noise to the data distribution and then use a reverse process to remove noises to produce samples from the data distribution. However, when the empirical data distribution consists of $n$ data point, using the empirical diffusion model will necessarily produce one of the existing data points. This is often referred to as the memorization effect, which is usually resolved by sophisticated machine learning procedures in the current literature. This work shows that the memorization problem can be resolved by a simple inertia update step at the end of the empirical diffusion model simulation. Our inertial diffusion model requires only the empirical diffusion model score function and it does not require any further training. We show that choosing the inertia diffusion model sample distribution is an $O\left(n^{-\frac{2}{d+4}}\right)$ Wasserstein-1 approximation of a data distribution lying on a $C^2$ manifold of dimension $d$. Since this estimate is significant smaller the Wasserstein1 distance between population and empirical distributions, it rigorously shows the inertial diffusion model produces new data samples. Remarkably, this upper bound is completely free of the ambient space dimension, since there is no training involved. Our analysis utilizes the fact that the inertial diffusion model samples are approximately distributed as the Gaussian kernel density estimator on the manifold. This reveals an interesting connection between diffusion model and manifold learning.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02508v2
Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Automated Feature Generation,"Feature generation involves creating new features from raw data to capture complex relationships among the original features, improving model robustness and machine learning performance. Current methods using reinforcement learning for feature generation have made feature exploration more flexible and efficient. However, several challenges remain: first, during feature expansion, a large number of redundant features are generated. When removing them, current methods only retain the best features each round, neglecting those that perform poorly initially but could improve later. Second, the state representation used by current methods fails to fully capture complex feature relationships. Third, there are significant differences between discrete and continuous features in tabular data, requiring different operations for each type. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dual-agent reinforcement learning method for feature generation. Two agents are designed: the first generates new features, and the second determines whether they should be preserved. A self-attention mechanism enhances state representation, and diverse operations distinguish interactions between discrete and continuous features. The experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective. The code is available at https://github.com/extess0/DARL.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12628v1
"Adaptive, Robust and Scalable Bayesian Filtering for Online Learning","In this thesis, we introduce Bayesian filtering as a principled framework for tackling diverse sequential machine learning problems, including online (continual) learning, prequential (one-step-ahead) forecasting, and contextual bandits. To this end, this thesis addresses key challenges in applying Bayesian filtering to these problems: adaptivity to non-stationary environments, robustness to model misspecification and outliers, and scalability to the high-dimensional parameter space of deep neural networks. We develop novel tools within the Bayesian filtering framework to address each of these challenges, including: (i) a modular framework that enables the development adaptive approaches for online learning; (ii) a novel, provably robust filter with similar computational cost to standard filters, that employs Generalised Bayes; and (iii) a set of tools for sequentially updating model parameters using approximate second-order optimisation methods that exploit the overparametrisation of high-dimensional parametric models such as neural networks. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate the improved performance of our methods in dynamic, high-dimensional, and misspecified models.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07267v1
EVALOOP: Assessing LLM Robustness in Programming from a Self-consistency   Perspective,"Assessing the programming capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for their effective use in software engineering. Current evaluations, however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained. Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming. We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1 performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo, despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12185v1
ReLU integral probability metric and its applications,"We propose a parametric integral probability metric (IPM) to measure the discrepancy between two probability measures. The proposed IPM leverages a specific parametric family of discriminators, such as single-node neural networks with ReLU activation, to effectively distinguish between distributions, making it applicable in high-dimensional settings. By optimizing over the parameters of the chosen discriminator class, the proposed IPM demonstrates that its estimators have good convergence rates and can serve as a surrogate for other IPMs that use smooth nonparametric discriminator classes. We present an efficient algorithm for practical computation, offering a simple implementation and requiring fewer hyperparameters. Furthermore, we explore its applications in various tasks, such as covariate balancing for causal inference and fair representation learning. Across such diverse applications, we demonstrate that the proposed IPM provides strong theoretical guarantees, and empirical experiments show that it achieves comparable or even superior performance to other methods.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18897v1
OLinear: A Linear Model for Time Series Forecasting in Orthogonally   Transformed Domain,"This paper presents $\mathbf{OLinear}$, a $\mathbf{linear}$-based multivariate time series forecasting model that operates in an $\mathbf{o}$rthogonally transformed domain. Recent forecasting models typically adopt the temporal forecast (TF) paradigm, which directly encode and decode time series in the time domain. However, the entangled step-wise dependencies in series data can hinder the performance of TF. To address this, some forecasters conduct encoding and decoding in the transformed domain using fixed, dataset-independent bases (e.g., sine and cosine signals in the Fourier transform). In contrast, we utilize $\mathbf{OrthoTrans}$, a data-adaptive transformation based on an orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the series' temporal Pearson correlation matrix. This approach enables more effective encoding and decoding in the decorrelated feature domain and can serve as a plug-in module to enhance existing forecasters. To enhance the representation learning for multivariate time series, we introduce a customized linear layer, $\mathbf{NormLin}$, which employs a normalized weight matrix to capture multivariate dependencies. Empirically, the NormLin module shows a surprising performance advantage over multi-head self-attention, while requiring nearly half the FLOPs. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks and 140 forecasting tasks demonstrate that OLinear consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency. Notably, as a plug-in replacement for self-attention, the NormLin module consistently enhances Transformer-based forecasters. The code and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/OLinear",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08550v2
ProDS: Preference-oriented Data Selection for Instruction Tuning,"Instruction data selection aims to identify a high-quality subset from the training set that matches or exceeds the performance of the full dataset on target tasks. Existing methods focus on the instruction-to-response mapping, but neglect the human preference for diverse responses. In this paper, we propose Preference-oriented Data Selection method (ProDS) that scores training samples based on their alignment with preferences observed in the target set. Our key innovation lies in shifting the data selection criteria from merely estimating features for accurate response generation to explicitly aligning training samples with human preferences in target tasks. Specifically, direct preference optimization (DPO) is employed to estimate human preferences across diverse responses. Besides, a bidirectional preference synthesis strategy is designed to score training samples according to both positive preferences and negative preferences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our superiority to existing task-agnostic and targeted methods.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12754v1
A Comprehensive Benchmarking Platform for Deep Generative Models in   Molecular Design,"The development of novel pharmaceuticals represents a significant challenge in modern science, with substantial costs and time investments. Deep generative models have emerged as promising tools for accelerating drug discovery by efficiently exploring the vast chemical space. However, this rapidly evolving field lacks standardized evaluation protocols, impeding fair comparison between approaches. This research presents an extensive analysis of the Molecular Sets (MOSES) platform, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to standardize evaluation of deep generative models in molecular design. Through rigorous assessment of multiple generative architectures, including recurrent neural networks, variational autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks, we examine their capabilities in generating valid, unique, and novel molecular structures while maintaining specific chemical properties. Our findings reveal that different architectures exhibit complementary strengths across various metrics, highlighting the complex trade-offs between exploration and exploitation in chemical space. This study provides detailed insights into the current state of the art in molecular generation and establishes a foundation for future advancements in AI-driven drug discovery.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12848v1
Discretion in the Loop: Human Expertise in Algorithm-Assisted College   Advising,"In higher education, many institutions use algorithmic alerts to flag at-risk students and deliver advising at scale. While much research has focused on evaluating algorithmic predictions, relatively little is known about how discretionary interventions by human experts shape outcomes in algorithm-assisted settings. We study this question using rich quantitative and qualitative data from a randomized controlled trial of an algorithm-assisted advising program at Georgia State University. Taking a mixed-methods approach, we examine whether and how advisors use context unavailable to an algorithm to guide interventions and influence student success. We develop a causal graphical framework for human expertise in the interventional setting, extending prior work on discretion in purely predictive settings. We then test a necessary condition for discretionary expertise using structured advisor logs and student outcomes data, identifying several interventions that meet the criterion for statistical significance. Accordingly, we estimate that 2 out of 3 interventions taken by advisors in the treatment arm were plausibly ""expertly targeted"" to students using non-algorithmic context. Systematic qualitative analysis of advisor notes corroborates these findings, showing that advisors incorporate diverse forms of contextual information--such as personal circumstances, financial issues, and student engagement--into their decisions. Finally, we explore the broader implications of human discretion for long-term outcomes and equity, using heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. Our results offer theoretical and practical insight into the real-world effectiveness of algorithm-supported college advising, and underscore the importance of accounting for human expertise in the design, evaluation, and implementation of algorithmic decision systems.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13325v1
Nonparametric learning of covariate-based Markov jump processes using   RKHS techniques,"We propose a novel nonparametric approach for linking covariates to Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) using the mathematical framework of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). CTMCs provide a robust framework for modeling transitions across clinical or behavioral states, but traditional multistate models often rely on linear relationships. In contrast, we use a generalized Representer Theorem to enable tractable inference in functional space. For the Frequentist version, we apply normed square penalties, while for the Bayesian version, we explore sparsity inducing spike and slab priors. Due to the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional spaces, we successfully adapt the Expectation Maximization Variable Selection (EMVS) algorithm to efficiently identify the posterior mode. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive simulation studies and an application to follicular cell lymphoma data. Our performance metrics include the normalized difference between estimated and true nonlinear transition functions, as well as the difference in the probability of getting absorbed in one the final states, capturing the ability of our approach to predict long-term behaviors.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03119v1
A Fast Kernel-based Conditional Independence test with Application to   Causal Discovery,"Kernel-based conditional independence (KCI) testing is a powerful nonparametric method commonly employed in causal discovery tasks. Despite its flexibility and statistical reliability, cubic computational complexity limits its application to large datasets. To address this computational bottleneck, we propose \textit{FastKCI}, a scalable and parallelizable kernel-based conditional independence test that utilizes a mixture-of-experts approach inspired by embarrassingly parallel inference techniques for Gaussian processes. By partitioning the dataset based on a Gaussian mixture model over the conditioning variables, FastKCI conducts local KCI tests in parallel, aggregating the results using an importance-weighted sampling scheme. Experiments on synthetic datasets and benchmarks on real-world production data validate that FastKCI maintains the statistical power of the original KCI test while achieving substantial computational speedups. FastKCI thus represents a practical and efficient solution for conditional independence testing in causal inference on large-scale data.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11085v1
Uncertainty Quantification for Prior-Data Fitted Networks using   Martingale Posteriors,"Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have emerged as promising foundation models for prediction from tabular data sets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on small to moderate data sizes without tuning. While PFNs are motivated by Bayesian ideas, they do not provide any uncertainty quantification for predictive means, quantiles, or similar quantities. We propose a principled and efficient sampling procedure to construct Bayesian posteriors for such estimates based on Martingale posteriors, and prove its convergence. Several simulated and real-world data examples showcase the uncertainty quantification of our method in inference applications.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11325v1
Learning to Dissipate Energy in Oscillatory State-Space Models,"State-space models (SSMs) are a class of networks for sequence learning that benefit from fixed state size and linear complexity with respect to sequence length, contrasting the quadratic scaling of typical attention mechanisms. Inspired from observations in neuroscience, Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (LinOSS) are a recently proposed class of SSMs constructed from layers of discretized forced harmonic oscillators. Although these models perform competitively, leveraging fast parallel scans over diagonal recurrent matrices and achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks with sequence length up to 50k, LinOSS models rely on rigid energy dissipation (""forgetting"") mechanisms that are inherently coupled to the timescale of state evolution. As forgetting is a crucial mechanism for long-range reasoning, we demonstrate the representational limitations of these models and introduce Damped Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (D-LinOSS), a more general class of oscillatory SSMs that learn to dissipate latent state energy on multiple timescales. We analyze the spectral distribution of the model's recurrent matrices and prove that the SSM layers exhibit stable dynamics under simple, flexible parameterizations. D-LinOSS consistently outperforms previous LinOSS methods on long-range learning tasks, without introducing additional complexity, and simultaneously reduces the hyperparameter search space by 50%.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12171v1
ZenFlow: Enabling Stall-Free Offloading Training via Asynchronous   Updates,"Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often exceeds GPU memory limits, prompting systems to offload model states to CPU memory. However, existing offloaded training frameworks like ZeRO-Offload treat all parameters equally and update the full model on the CPU, causing severe GPU stalls, where fast, expensive GPUs sit idle waiting for slow CPU updates and limited-bandwidth PCIe transfers.   We present ZenFlow, a new offloading framework that prioritizes important parameters and decouples updates between GPU and CPU. ZenFlow performs in-place updates of important gradients on GPU, while asynchronously offloading and accumulating less important ones on CPU, fully overlapping CPU work with GPU computation.   To scale across GPUs, ZenFlow introduces a lightweight gradient selection method that exploits a novel spatial and temporal locality property of important gradients, avoiding costly global synchronization. ZenFlow achieves up to 5x end-to-end speedup, 2x lower PCIe traffic, and reduces GPU stalls by over 85 percent, all while preserving accuracy.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12242v1
The Gaussian Latent Machine: Efficient Prior and Posterior Sampling for   Inverse Problems,"We consider the problem of sampling from a product-of-experts-type model that encompasses many standard prior and posterior distributions commonly found in Bayesian imaging. We show that this model can be easily lifted into a novel latent variable model, which we refer to as a Gaussian latent machine. This leads to a general sampling approach that unifies and generalizes many existing sampling algorithms in the literature. Most notably, it yields a highly efficient and effective two-block Gibbs sampling approach in the general case, while also specializing to direct sampling algorithms in particular cases. Finally, we present detailed numerical experiments that demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed sampling approach across a wide range of prior and posterior sampling problems from Bayesian imaging.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12836v1
Measurement Score-Based Diffusion Model,"Diffusion models are widely used in applications ranging from image generation to inverse problems. However, training diffusion models typically requires clean ground-truth images, which are unavailable in many applications. We introduce the Measurement Score-based diffusion Model (MSM), a novel framework that learns partial measurement scores using only noisy and subsampled measurements. MSM models the distribution of full measurements as an expectation over partial scores induced by randomized subsampling. To make the MSM representation computationally efficient, we also develop a stochastic sampling algorithm that generates full images by using a randomly selected subset of partial scores at each step. We additionally propose a new posterior sampling method for solving inverse problems that reconstructs images using these partial scores. We provide a theoretical analysis that bounds the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distributions induced by full and stochastic sampling, establishing the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MSM on natural images and multi-coil MRI, showing that it can generate high-quality images and solve inverse problems -- all without access to clean training data. Code is available at https://github.com/wustl-cig/MSM.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11853v1
Identifying Causal Direction via Variational Bayesian Compression,"Telling apart the cause and effect between two random variables with purely observational data is a challenging problem that finds applications in various scientific disciplines. A key principle utilized in this task is the algorithmic Markov condition, which postulates that the joint distribution, when factorized according to the causal direction, yields a more succinct codelength compared to the anti-causal direction. Previous approaches approximate these codelengths by relying on simple functions or Gaussian processes (GPs) with easily evaluable complexity, compromising between model fitness and computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose leveraging the variational Bayesian learning of neural networks as an interpretation of the codelengths. Consequently, we can enhance the model fitness while promoting the succinctness of the codelengths, while avoiding the significant computational complexity of the GP-based approaches. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks in cause-effect identification demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing the overall performance of related complexity-based and structural causal model regression-based approaches.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07503v1
Efficient Federated Class-Incremental Learning of Pre-Trained Models via   Task-agnostic Low-rank Residual Adaptation,"Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) reduces communication and computation costs in federated fine-tuning of pre-trained models by updating only a small subset of model parameters. However, existing approaches assume static data distributions, failing to adequately address real-world scenarios where new classes continually emerge, particularly in Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL). FCIL faces two key challenges: catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation caused by non-IID data across clients. Unlike current methods that maintain separate task-specific components or suffer from aggregation noise during parameter aggregation, we propose Federated Task-agnostic Low-rank Residual Adaptation (Fed-TaLoRA), a novel parameter-efficient approach for fine-tuning in resource-constrained FCIL scenarios. Specifically, we fine-tune only shared task-agnostic LoRA parameters across sequential tasks, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting while enabling efficient knowledge transfer among clients. Based on a theoretical analysis of aggregation, we develop a novel residual weight update mechanism that ensures accurate knowledge consolidation with minimal overhead. Our methodological innovations are attributed to three key strategies: task-agnostic adaptation, post-aggregation model calibration, and strategic placement of LoRA modules. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Fed-TaLoRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse data heterogeneity scenarios while substantially reducing resource requirements.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12318v1
TAROT: Towards Essentially Domain-Invariant Robustness with Theoretical   Justification,"Robust domain adaptation against adversarial attacks is a critical research area that aims to develop models capable of maintaining consistent performance across diverse and challenging domains. In this paper, we derive a new generalization bound for robust risk on the target domain using a novel divergence measure specifically designed for robust domain adaptation. Building upon this, we propose a new algorithm named TAROT, which is designed to enhance both domain adaptability and robustness. Through extensive experiments, TAROT not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness but also significantly enhances domain generalization and scalability by effectively learning domain-invariant features. In particular, TAROT achieves superior performance on the challenging DomainNet dataset, demonstrating its ability to learn domain-invariant representations that generalize well across different domains, including unseen ones. These results highlight the broader applicability of our approach in real-world domain adaptation scenarios.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06580v1
Continuous Subspace Optimization for Continual Learning,"Continual learning aims to learn multiple tasks sequentially while preserving prior knowledge, but faces the challenge of catastrophic forgetting when acquiring new knowledge. Recently, approaches leveraging pre-trained models have gained increasing popularity to mitigate this issue, due to the strong generalization ability of foundation models. To adjust pre-trained models for new tasks, existing methods usually employ low-rank adaptation, which restricts parameter updates to a fixed low-rank subspace. However, constraining the optimization space inherently compromises the model's learning capacity, resulting in inferior performance. To address the limitation, we propose Continuous Subspace Optimization for Continual Learning (CoSO) to fine-tune the model in a series of subspaces rather than a single one. These sequential subspaces are dynamically determined through the singular value decomposition of gradients. CoSO updates the model by projecting gradients into these subspaces, ensuring memory-efficient optimization. To mitigate forgetting, the optimization subspaces of each task are set to be orthogonal to the historical task subspace. During task learning, CoSO maintains a task-specific component that captures the critical update directions associated with the current task. Upon completing a task, this component is used to update the historical task subspace, laying the groundwork for subsequent learning. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that CoSO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios with long task sequences.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11816v1
Multi-Attribute Graph Estimation with Sparse-Group Non-Convex Penalties,"We consider the problem of inferring the conditional independence graph (CIG) of high-dimensional Gaussian vectors from multi-attribute data. Most existing methods for graph estimation are based on single-attribute models where one associates a scalar random variable with each node. In multi-attribute graphical models, each node represents a random vector. In this paper we provide a unified theoretical analysis of multi-attribute graph learning using a penalized log-likelihood objective function. We consider both convex (sparse-group lasso) and sparse-group non-convex (log-sum and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalties) penalty/regularization functions. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach coupled with local linear approximation to non-convex penalties is presented for optimization of the objective function. For non-convex penalties, theoretical analysis establishing local consistency in support recovery, local convexity and precision matrix estimation in high-dimensional settings is provided under two sets of sufficient conditions: with and without some irrepresentability conditions. We illustrate our approaches using both synthetic and real-data numerical examples. In the synthetic data examples the sparse-group log-sum penalized objective function significantly outperformed the lasso penalized as well as SCAD penalized objective functions with $F_1$-score and Hamming distance as performance metrics.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11984v1
RoFL: Robust Fingerprinting of Language Models,"AI developers are releasing large language models (LLMs) under a variety of different licenses. Many of these licenses restrict the ways in which the models or their outputs may be used. This raises the question how license violations may be recognized. In particular, how can we identify that an API or product uses (an adapted version of) a particular LLM? We present a new method that enable model developers to perform such identification via fingerprints: statistical patterns that are unique to the developer's model and robust to common alterations of that model. Our method permits model identification in a black-box setting using a limited number of queries, enabling identification of models that can only be accessed via an API or product. The fingerprints are non-invasive: our method does not require any changes to the model during training, hence by design, it does not impact model quality. Empirically, we find our method provides a high degree of robustness to common changes in the model or inference settings. In our experiments, it substantially outperforms prior art, including invasive methods that explicitly train watermarks into the model.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12682v1
RN-F: A Novel Approach for Mitigating Contaminated Data in Large   Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational in modern artificial intelligence, powering a wide range of applications from code generation and virtual assistants to scientific research and enterprise automation. However, concerns about data contamination--where test data overlaps with training data--have raised serious questions about the reliability of these applications. Despite awareness of this issue, existing methods fall short in effectively identifying or mitigating contamination. In this paper, we propose Residual-Noise Fingerprinting (RN-F), a novel framework for detecting contaminated data in LLMs. RN-F is a single-pass, gradient-free detection method that leverages residual signal patterns without introducing additional floating-point operations. Our approach is lightweight, model-agnostic, and efficient. We evaluate RN-F on multiple LLMs across various contaminated datasets and show that it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving performance improvements of up to 10.5% in contamination detection metrics.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13249v1
Adaptive parameter-efficient fine-tuning via Hessian-informed subset   selection,"Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a highly effective approach for adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks with minimal computational overhead. At the core, PEFT methods freeze most parameters and only trains a small subset (say $<0.1\%$ of total parameters). Notably, different PEFT methods select different subsets, resulting in varying levels of performance. This variation prompts a key question: how to effectively select the most influential subset to train?   We formulate the subset selection as a multi-task problem: maximizing the performance and minimizing the number of trainable parameters. We leverage a series of transformations -- including $\epsilon$-constraint method and second-order Taylor approximation -- to arrive at the classical 0-1 knapsack problem, which we solve through the lens of Pareto optimality. Consequently, we propose AdaPEFT, a Hessian-informed PEFT that adapts to various tasks and models, in which the selected subset empirically transfers across training horizons and model sizes.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12579v1
A new methodology to decompose a parametric domain using reduced order   data manifold in machine learning,"We propose a new methodology for parametric domain decomposition using iterative principal component analysis. Starting with iterative principle component analysis, the high dimension manifold is reduced to the lower dimension manifold. Moreover, two approaches are developed to reconstruct the inverse projector to project from the lower data component to the original one. Afterward, we provide a detailed strategy to decompose the parametric domain based on the low dimension manifold. Finally, numerical examples of harmonic transport problem are given to illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method comparing to the classical meta-models such as neural networks.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08497v1
LatticeVision: Image to Image Networks for Modeling Non-Stationary   Spatial Data,"In many scientific and industrial applications, we are given a handful of instances (a 'small ensemble') of a spatially distributed quantity (a 'field') but would like to acquire many more. For example, a large ensemble of global temperature sensitivity fields from a climate model can help farmers, insurers, and governments plan appropriately. When acquiring more data is prohibitively expensive -- as is the case with climate models -- statistical emulation offers an efficient alternative for simulating synthetic yet realistic fields. However, parameter inference using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is computationally prohibitive, especially for large, non-stationary fields. Thus, many recent works train neural networks to estimate parameters given spatial fields as input, sidestepping MLE completely. In this work we focus on a popular class of parametric, spatially autoregressive (SAR) models. We make a simple yet impactful observation; because the SAR parameters can be arranged on a regular grid, both inputs (spatial fields) and outputs (model parameters) can be viewed as images. Using this insight, we demonstrate that image-to-image (I2I) networks enable faster and more accurate parameter estimation for a class of non-stationary SAR models with unprecedented complexity.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09803v1
Do global forecasting models require frequent retraining?,"In an era of increasing computational capabilities and growing environmental consciousness, organizations face a critical challenge in balancing the accuracy of forecasting models with computational efficiency and sustainability. Global forecasting models, lowering the computational time, have gained significant attention over the years. However, the common practice of retraining these models with new observations raises important questions about the costs of forecasting. Using ten different machine learning and deep learning models, we analyzed various retraining scenarios, ranging from continuous updates to no retraining at all, across two large retail datasets. We showed that less frequent retraining strategies maintain the forecast accuracy while reducing the computational costs, providing a more sustainable approach to large-scale forecasting. We also found that machine learning models are a marginally better choice to reduce the costs of forecasting when coupled with less frequent model retraining strategies as the frequency of the data increases. Our findings challenge the conventional belief that frequent retraining is essential for maintaining forecasting accuracy. Instead, periodic retraining offers a good balance between predictive performance and efficiency, both in the case of point and probabilistic forecasting. These insights provide actionable guidelines for organizations seeking to optimize forecasting pipelines while reducing costs and energy consumption.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00356v1
Causal mediation analysis with one or multiple mediators: a comparative   study,"Mediation analysis breaks down the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome into an indirect effect, acting through a third group of variables called mediators, and a direct effect, operating through other mechanisms. Mediation analysis is hard because confounders between treatment, mediators, and outcome blur effect estimates in observational studies. Many estimators have been proposed to adjust on those confounders and provide accurate causal estimates. We consider parametric and non-parametric implementations of classical estimators and provide a thorough evaluation for the estimation of the direct and indirect effects in the context of causal mediation analysis for binary, continuous, and multi-dimensional mediators. We assess several approaches in a comprehensive benchmark on simulated data. Our results show that advanced statistical approaches such as the multiply robust and the double machine learning estimators achieve good performances in most of the simulated settings and on real data. As an example of application, we propose a thorough analysis of factors known to influence cognitive functions to assess if the mechanism involves modifications in brain morphology using the UK Biobank brain imaging cohort. This analysis shows that for several physiological factors, such as hypertension and obesity, a substantial part of the effect is mediated by changes in the brain structure. This work provides guidance to the practitioner from the formulation of a valid causal mediation problem, including the verification of the identification assumptions, to the choice of an adequate estimator.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07323v1
Iteratively reweighted kernel machines efficiently learn sparse   functions,"The impressive practical performance of neural networks is often attributed to their ability to learn low-dimensional data representations and hierarchical structure directly from data. In this work, we argue that these two phenomena are not unique to neural networks, and can be elicited from classical kernel methods. Namely, we show that the derivative of the kernel predictor can detect the influential coordinates with low sample complexity. Moreover, by iteratively using the derivatives to reweight the data and retrain kernel machines, one is able to efficiently learn hierarchical polynomials with finite leap complexity. Numerical experiments illustrate the developed theory.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08277v1
Learning Treatment Allocations with Risk Control Under Partial   Identifiability,Learning beneficial treatment allocations for a patient population is an important problem in precision medicine. Many treatments come with adverse side effects that are not commensurable with their potential benefits. Patients who do not receive benefits after such treatments are thereby subjected to unnecessary harm. This is a `treatment risk' that we aim to control when learning beneficial allocations. The constrained learning problem is challenged by the fact that the treatment risk is not in general identifiable using either randomized trial or observational data. We propose a certifiable learning method that controls the treatment risk with finite samples in the partially identified setting. The method is illustrated using both simulated and real data.,ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08378v1
Source Anonymity for Private Random Walk Decentralized Learning,"This paper considers random walk-based decentralized learning, where at each iteration of the learning process, one user updates the model and sends it to a randomly chosen neighbor until a convergence criterion is met. Preserving data privacy is a central concern and open problem in decentralized learning. We propose a privacy-preserving algorithm based on public-key cryptography and anonymization. In this algorithm, the user updates the model and encrypts the result using a distant user's public key. The encrypted result is then transmitted through the network with the goal of reaching that specific user. The key idea is to hide the source's identity so that, when the destination user decrypts the result, it does not know who the source was. The challenge is to design a network-dependent probability distribution (at the source) over the potential destinations such that, from the receiver's perspective, all users have a similar likelihood of being the source. We introduce the problem and construct a scheme that provides anonymity with theoretical guarantees. We focus on random regular graphs to establish rigorous guarantees.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07011v1
Smoothed SGD for quantiles: Bahadur representation and Gaussian   approximation,"This paper considers the estimation of quantiles via a smoothed version of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. By smoothing the score function in the conventional SGD quantile algorithm, we achieve monotonicity in the quantile level in that the estimated quantile curves do not cross. We derive non-asymptotic tail probability bounds for the smoothed SGD quantile estimate both for the case with and without Polyak-Ruppert averaging. For the latter, we also provide a uniform Bahadur representation and a resulting Gaussian approximation result. Numerical studies show good finite sample behavior for our theoretical results.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13299v1
Lie Group Symmetry Discovery and Enforcement Using Vector Fields,"Symmetry-informed machine learning can exhibit advantages over machine learning which fails to account for symmetry. Additionally, recent attention has been given to continuous symmetry discovery using vector fields which serve as infinitesimal generators for Lie group symmetries. In this paper, we extend the notion of non-affine symmetry discovery to functions defined by neural networks. We further extend work in this area by introducing symmetry enforcement of smooth models using vector fields. Finally, we extend work on symmetry discovery using vector fields by providing both theoretical and experimental material on the restriction of the symmetry search space to infinitesimal isometries.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08219v1
Batched Nonparametric Bandits via k-Nearest Neighbor UCB,"We study sequential decision-making in batched nonparametric contextual bandits, where actions are selected over a finite horizon divided into a small number of batches. Motivated by constraints in domains such as medicine and marketing -- where online feedback is limited -- we propose a nonparametric algorithm that combines adaptive k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) regression with the upper confidence bound (UCB) principle. Our method, BaNk-UCB, is fully nonparametric, adapts to the context dimension, and is simple to implement. Unlike prior work relying on parametric or binning-based estimators, BaNk-UCB uses local geometry to estimate rewards and adaptively balances exploration and exploitation. We provide near-optimal regret guarantees under standard Lipschitz smoothness and margin assumptions, using a theoretically motivated batch schedule that balances regret across batches and achieves minimax-optimal rates. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BaNk-UCB consistently outperforms binning-based baselines.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10498v1
Decomposing stimulus-specific sensory neural information via diffusion   models,"To understand sensory coding, we must ask not only how much information neurons encode, but also what that information is about. This requires decomposing mutual information into contributions from individual stimuli and stimulus features fundamentally ill-posed problem with infinitely many possible solutions. We address this by introducing three core axioms, additivity, positivity, and locality that any meaningful stimulus-wise decomposition should satisfy. We then derive a decomposition that meets all three criteria and remains tractable for high-dimensional stimuli. Our decomposition can be efficiently estimated using diffusion models, allowing for scaling up to complex, structured and naturalistic stimuli. Applied to a model of visual neurons, our method quantifies how specific stimuli and features contribute to encoded information. Our approach provides a scalable, interpretable tool for probing representations in both biological and artificial neural systems.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11309v1
Transformers as Unsupervised Learning Algorithms: A study on Gaussian   Mixtures,"The transformer architecture has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modern artificial intelligence, among which the capability of implicitly learning an internal model during inference time is widely believed to play a key role in the under standing of pre-trained large language models. However, most recent works have been focusing on studying supervised learning topics such as in-context learning, leaving the field of unsupervised learning largely unexplored. This paper investigates the capabilities of transformers in solving Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), a fundamental unsupervised learning problem through the lens of statistical estimation. We propose a transformer-based learning framework called TGMM that simultaneously learns to solve multiple GMM tasks using a shared transformer backbone. The learned models are empirically demonstrated to effectively mitigate the limitations of classical methods such as Expectation-Maximization (EM) or spectral algorithms, at the same time exhibit reasonable robustness to distribution shifts. Theoretically, we prove that transformers can approximate both the EM algorithm and a core component of spectral methods (cubic tensor power iterations). These results bridge the gap between practical success and theoretical understanding, positioning transformers as versatile tools for unsupervised learning.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11918v1
Bayesian Robust Aggregation for Federated Learning,"Federated Learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models on decentralized data. This scheme, however, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, when some of the clients submit corrupted model updates. In real-world scenarios, the total number of compromised clients is typically unknown, with the extent of attacks potentially varying over time. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive approach for robust aggregation of model updates based on Bayesian inference. The mean update is defined by the maximum of the likelihood marginalized over probabilities of each client to be `honest'. As a result, the method shares the simplicity of the classical average estimators (e.g., sample mean or geometric median), being independent of the number of compromised clients. At the same time, it is as effective against attacks as methods specifically tailored to Federated Learning, such as Krum. We compare our approach with other aggregation schemes in federated setting on three benchmark image classification data sets. The proposed method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various attack types with static and varying number of malicious clients.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02490v1
A Hybrid Mixture of $t$-Factor Analyzers for Clustering High-dimensional   Data,"This paper develops a novel hybrid approach for estimating the mixture model of $t$-factor analyzers (MtFA) that employs multivariate $t$-distribution and factor model to cluster and characterize grouped data. The traditional estimation method for MtFA faces computational challenges, particularly in high-dimensional settings, where the eigendecomposition of large covariance matrices and the iterative nature of Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms lead to scalability issues. We propose a computational scheme that integrates a profile likelihood method into the EM framework to efficiently obtain the model parameter estimates. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through simulations showcasing its superior computational efficiency compared to the existing method, while preserving clustering accuracy and resilience against outliers. Our method is applied to cluster the Gamma-ray bursts, reinforcing several claims in the literature that Gamma-ray bursts have heterogeneous subpopulations and providing characterizations of the estimated groups.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21120v1
Sample Complexity of Distributionally Robust Average-Reward   Reinforcement Learning,"Motivated by practical applications where stable long-term performance is critical-such as robotics, operations research, and healthcare-we study the problem of distributionally robust (DR) average-reward reinforcement learning. We propose two algorithms that achieve near-optimal sample complexity. The first reduces the problem to a DR discounted Markov decision process (MDP), while the second, Anchored DR Average-Reward MDP, introduces an anchoring state to stabilize the controlled transition kernels within the uncertainty set. Assuming the nominal MDP is uniformly ergodic, we prove that both algorithms attain a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(|\mathbf{S}||\mathbf{A}| t_{\mathrm{mix}}^2\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$ for estimating the optimal policy as well as the robust average reward under KL and $f_k$-divergence-based uncertainty sets, provided the uncertainty radius is sufficiently small. Here, $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\mathbf{S}|$ and $|\mathbf{A}|$ denote the sizes of the state and action spaces, and $t_{\mathrm{mix}}$ is the mixing time of the nominal MDP. This represents the first finite-sample convergence guarantee for DR average-reward reinforcement learning. We further validate the convergence rates of our algorithms through numerical experiments.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10007v1
Advancing Constrained Monotonic Neural Networks: Achieving Universal   Approximation Beyond Bounded Activations,"Conventional techniques for imposing monotonicity in MLPs by construction involve the use of non-negative weight constraints and bounded activation functions, which pose well-known optimization challenges. In this work, we generalize previous theoretical results, showing that MLPs with non-negative weight constraint and activations that saturate on alternating sides are universal approximators for monotonic functions. Additionally, we show an equivalence between the saturation side in the activations and the sign of the weight constraint. This connection allows us to prove that MLPs with convex monotone activations and non-positive constrained weights also qualify as universal approximators, in contrast to their non-negative constrained counterparts. Our results provide theoretical grounding to the empirical effectiveness observed in previous works while leading to possible architectural simplification. Moreover, to further alleviate the optimization difficulties, we propose an alternative formulation that allows the network to adjust its activations according to the sign of the weights. This eliminates the requirement for weight reparameterization, easing initialization and improving training stability. Experimental evaluation reinforces the validity of the theoretical results, showing that our novel approach compares favourably to traditional monotonic architectures.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02537v2
Efficient MCMC Sampling with Expensive-to-Compute and Irregular   Likelihoods,"Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is challenging when the likelihood function is irregular and expensive to compute. We explore several sampling algorithms that make use of subset evaluations to reduce computational overhead. We adapt the subset samplers for this setting where gradient information is not available or is unreliable. To achieve this, we introduce data-driven proxies in place of Taylor expansions and define a novel computation-cost aware adaptive controller. We undertake an extensive evaluation for a challenging disease modelling task and a configurable task with similar irregularity in the likelihood surface. We find our improved version of Hierarchical Importance with Nested Training Samples (HINTS), with adaptive proposals and a data-driven proxy, obtains the best sampling error in a fixed computational budget. We conclude that subset evaluations can provide cheap and naturally-tempered exploration, while a data-driven proxy can pre-screen proposals successfully in explored regions of the state space. These two elements combine through hierarchical delayed acceptance to achieve efficient, exact sampling.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10448v1
AltLoRA: Towards Better Gradient Approximation in Low-Rank Adaptation   with Alternating Projections,"Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as an effective technique for reducing memory overhead in fine-tuning large language models. However, it often suffers from sub-optimal performance compared with full fine-tuning since the update is constrained in the low-rank space. Recent variants such as LoRA-Pro attempt to mitigate this by adjusting the gradients of the low-rank matrices to approximate the full gradient. However, LoRA-Pro's solution is not unique, and different solutions can lead to significantly varying performance in ablation studies. Besides, to incorporate momentum or adaptive optimization design, approaches like LoRA-Pro must first compute the equivalent gradient, causing a higher memory cost close to full fine-tuning. A key challenge remains in integrating momentum properly into the low-rank space with lower memory cost. In this work, we propose AltLoRA, an alternating projection method that avoids the difficulties in gradient approximation brought by the joint update design, meanwhile integrating momentum without higher memory complexity. Our theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees and further shows that AltLoRA enables stable feature learning and robustness to transformation invariance. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that AltLoRA outperforms LoRA and its variants, narrowing the gap toward full fine-tuning while preserving superior memory efficiency.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12455v1
Communication-Efficient Hybrid Language Model via Uncertainty-Aware   Opportunistic and Compressed Transmission,"To support emerging language-based applications using dispersed and heterogeneous computing resources, the hybrid language model (HLM) offers a promising architecture, where an on-device small language model (SLM) generates draft tokens that are validated and corrected by a remote large language model (LLM). However, the original HLM suffers from substantial communication overhead, as the LLM requires the SLM to upload the full vocabulary distribution for each token. Moreover, both communication and computation resources are wasted when the LLM validates tokens that are highly likely to be accepted. To overcome these limitations, we propose communication-efficient and uncertainty-aware HLM (CU-HLM). In CU-HLM, the SLM transmits truncated vocabulary distributions only when its output uncertainty is high. We validate the feasibility of this opportunistic transmission by discovering a strong correlation between SLM's uncertainty and LLM's rejection probability. Furthermore, we theoretically derive optimal uncertainty thresholds and optimal vocabulary truncation strategies. Simulation results show that, compared to standard HLM, CU-HLM achieves up to 206$\times$ higher token throughput by skipping 74.8% transmissions with 97.4% vocabulary compression, while maintaining 97.4% accuracy.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11788v1
Modeling Spatial Extremes using Non-Gaussian Spatial Autoregressive   Models via Convolutional Neural Networks,"Data derived from remote sensing or numerical simulations often have a regular gridded structure and are large in volume, making it challenging to find accurate spatial models that can fill in missing grid cells or simulate the process effectively, especially in the presence of spatial heterogeneity and heavy-tailed marginal distributions. To overcome this issue, we present a spatial autoregressive modeling framework, which maps observations at a location and its neighbors to independent random variables. This is a highly flexible modeling approach and well-suited for non-Gaussian fields, providing simpler interpretability. In particular, we consider the SAR model with Generalized Extreme Value distribution innovations to combine the observation at a central grid location with its neighbors, capturing extreme spatial behavior based on the heavy-tailed innovations. While these models are fast to simulate by exploiting the sparsity of the key matrices in the computations, the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters is prohibitive due to the intractability of the likelihood, making optimization challenging. To overcome this, we train a convolutional neural network on a large training set that covers a useful parameter space, and then use the trained network for fast parameter estimation. Finally, we apply this model to analyze annual maximum precipitation data from ERA-Interim-driven Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations, allowing us to explore its spatial extreme behavior across North America.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03034v1
Whitened Score Diffusion: A Structured Prior for Imaging Inverse   Problems,"Conventional score-based diffusion models (DMs) may struggle with anisotropic Gaussian diffusion processes due to the required inversion of covariance matrices in the denoising score matching training objective \cite{vincent_connection_2011}. We propose Whitened Score (WS) diffusion models, a novel SDE-based framework that learns the Whitened Score function instead of the standard score. This approach circumvents covariance inversion, extending score-based DMs by enabling stable training of DMs on arbitrary Gaussian forward noising processes. WS DMs establish equivalence with FM for arbitrary Gaussian noise, allow for tailored spectral inductive biases, and provide strong Bayesian priors for imaging inverse problems with structured noise. We experiment with a variety of computational imaging tasks using the CIFAR and CelebA ($64\times64$) datasets and demonstrate that WS diffusion priors trained on anisotropic Gaussian noising processes consistently outperform conventional diffusion priors based on isotropic Gaussian noise.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10311v2
A Minimum Description Length Approach to Regularization in Neural   Networks,"State-of-the-art neural networks can be trained to become remarkable solutions to many problems. But while these architectures can express symbolic, perfect solutions, trained models often arrive at approximations instead. We show that the choice of regularization method plays a crucial role: when trained on formal languages with standard regularization ($L_1$, $L_2$, or none), expressive architectures not only fail to converge to correct solutions but are actively pushed away from perfect initializations. In contrast, applying the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to balance model complexity with data fit provides a theoretically grounded regularization method. Using MDL, perfect solutions are selected over approximations, independently of the optimization algorithm. We propose that unlike existing regularization techniques, MDL introduces the appropriate inductive bias to effectively counteract overfitting and promote generalization.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13398v1
Entropy-Guided Sampling of Flat Modes in Discrete Spaces,"Sampling from flat modes in discrete spaces is a crucial yet underexplored problem. Flat modes represent robust solutions and have broad applications in combinatorial optimization and discrete generative modeling. However, existing sampling algorithms often overlook the mode volume and struggle to capture flat modes effectively. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Entropic Discrete Langevin Proposal} (EDLP), which incorporates local entropy into the sampling process through a continuous auxiliary variable under a joint distribution. The local entropy term guides the discrete sampler toward flat modes with a small overhead. We provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for EDLP in locally log-concave discrete distributions. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms traditional approaches across tasks that require sampling from flat basins, including Bernoulli distribution, restricted Boltzmann machines, combinatorial optimization, and binary neural networks.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02296v2
Regularity and Stability Properties of Selective SSMs with Discontinuous   Gating,"Deep Selective State-Space Models (SSMs), characterized by input-dependent, time-varying parameters, offer significant expressive power but pose challenges for stability analysis, especially with discontinuous gating signals. In this paper, we investigate the stability and regularity properties of continuous-time selective SSMs through the lens of passivity and Input-to-State Stability (ISS). We establish that intrinsic energy dissipation guarantees exponential forgetting of past states. Crucially, we prove that the unforced system dynamics possess an underlying minimal quadratic energy function whose defining matrix exhibits robust $\text{AUC}_{\text{loc}}$ regularity, accommodating discontinuous gating. Furthermore, assuming a universal quadratic storage function ensures passivity across all inputs, we derive parametric LMI conditions and kernel constraints that limit gating mechanisms, formalizing ""irreversible forgetting"" of recurrent models. Finally, we provide sufficient conditions for global ISS, linking uniform local dissipativity to overall system robustness. Our findings offer a rigorous framework for understanding and designing stable and reliable deep selective SSMs.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11602v1
Mallows-type model averaging: Non-asymptotic analysis and all-subset   combination,"Model averaging (MA) and ensembling play a crucial role in statistical and machine learning practice. When multiple candidate models are considered, MA techniques can be used to weight and combine them, often resulting in improved predictive accuracy and better estimation stability compared to model selection (MS) methods. In this paper, we address two challenges in combining least squares estimators from both theoretical and practical perspectives. We first establish several oracle inequalities for least squares MA via minimizing a Mallows' $C_p$ criterion under an arbitrary candidate model set. Compared to existing studies, these oracle inequalities yield faster excess risk and directly imply the asymptotic optimality of the resulting MA estimators under milder conditions. Moreover, we consider candidate model construction and investigate the problem of optimal all-subset combination for least squares estimators, which is an important yet rarely discussed topic in the existing literature. We show that there exists a fundamental limit to achieving the optimal all-subset MA risk. To attain this limit, we propose a novel Mallows-type MA procedure based on a dimension-adaptive $C_p$ criterion. The implicit ensembling effects of several MS procedures are also revealed and discussed. We conduct several numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Mallows-type MA estimator.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02637v1
Your Offline Policy is Not Trustworthy: Bilevel Reinforcement Learning   for Sequential Portfolio Optimization,"Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown significant promise for sequential portfolio optimization tasks, such as stock trading, where the objective is to maximize cumulative returns while minimizing risks using historical data. However, traditional RL approaches often produce policies that merely memorize the optimal yet impractical buying and selling behaviors within the fixed dataset. These offline policies are less generalizable as they fail to account for the non-stationary nature of the market. Our approach, MetaTrader, frames portfolio optimization as a new type of partial-offline RL problem and makes two technical contributions. First, MetaTrader employs a bilevel learning framework that explicitly trains the RL agent to improve both in-domain profits on the original dataset and out-of-domain performance across diverse transformations of the raw financial data. Second, our approach incorporates a new temporal difference (TD) method that approximates worst-case TD estimates from a batch of transformed TD targets, addressing the value overestimation issue that is particularly challenging in scenarios with limited offline data. Our empirical results on two public stock datasets show that MetaTrader outperforms existing methods, including both RL-based approaches and traditional stock prediction models.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12759v1
Detect and Correct: A Selective Noise Correction Method for Learning   with Noisy Labels,"Falsely annotated samples, also known as noisy labels, can significantly harm the performance of deep learning models. Two main approaches for learning with noisy labels are global noise estimation and data filtering. Global noise estimation approximates the noise across the entire dataset using a noise transition matrix, but it can unnecessarily adjust correct labels, leaving room for local improvements. Data filtering, on the other hand, discards potentially noisy samples but risks losing valuable data. Our method identifies potentially noisy samples based on their loss distribution. We then apply a selection process to separate noisy and clean samples and learn a noise transition matrix to correct the loss for noisy samples while leaving the clean data unaffected, thereby improving the training process. Our approach ensures robust learning and enhanced model performance by preserving valuable information from noisy samples and refining the correction process. We applied our method to standard image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) and a biological scRNA-seq cell-type annotation dataset. We observed a significant improvement in model accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13342v1
Why Knowledge Distillation Works in Generative Models: A Minimal Working   Explanation,"Knowledge distillation (KD) is a core component in the training and deployment of modern generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs). While its empirical benefits are well documented--enabling smaller student models to emulate the performance of much larger teachers--the underlying mechanisms by which KD improves generative quality remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a minimal working explanation of KD in generative modeling. Using a controlled simulation with mixtures of Gaussians, we demonstrate that distillation induces a trade-off between precision and recall in the student model. As the teacher distribution becomes more selective, the student concentrates more probability mass on high-likelihood regions at the expense of coverage--a behavior modulated by a single entropy-controlling parameter. We then validate this effect in a large-scale language modeling setup using the SmolLM2 family of models. Empirical results reveal the same precision-recall dynamics observed in simulation, where precision corresponds to sample quality and recall to distributional coverage. This precision-recall trade-off proves especially beneficial in scenarios where sample quality outweighs diversity, such as instruction tuning or downstream generation. Our analysis provides a simple and general explanation for the effectiveness of KD in generative modeling.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13111v1
Information-theoretic reduction of deep neural networks to linear models   in the overparametrized proportional regime,"We rigorously analyse fully-trained neural networks of arbitrary depth in the Bayesian optimal setting in the so-called proportional scaling regime where the number of training samples and width of the input and all inner layers diverge proportionally. We prove an information-theoretic equivalence between the Bayesian deep neural network model trained from data generated by a teacher with matching architecture, and a simpler model of optimal inference in a generalized linear model. This equivalence enables us to compute the optimal generalization error for deep neural networks in this regime. We thus prove the ""deep Gaussian equivalence principle"" conjectured in Cui et al. (2023) (arXiv:2302.00375). Our result highlights that in order to escape this ""trivialisation"" of deep neural networks (in the sense of reduction to a linear model) happening in the strongly overparametrized proportional regime, models trained from much more data have to be considered.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03577v1
Occult: Optimizing Collaborative Communication across Experts for   Accelerated Parallel MoE Training and Inference,"Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures could achieve impressive computational efficiency with expert parallelism, which relies heavily on all-to-all communication across devices. Unfortunately, such communication overhead typically constitutes a significant portion of the total runtime, hampering the scalability of distributed training and inference for modern MoE models (consuming over $40\%$ runtime in large-scale training). In this paper, we first define collaborative communication to illustrate this intrinsic limitation, and then propose system- and algorithm-level innovations to reduce communication costs. Specifically, given a pair of experts co-activated by one token, we call them ""collaborated"", which comprises $2$ cases as intra- and inter-collaboration, depending on whether they are kept on the same device. Our pilot investigations reveal that augmenting the proportion of intra-collaboration can accelerate expert parallelism at scale. It motivates us to strategically optimize collaborative communication for accelerated MoE training and inference, dubbed Occult. Our designs are capable of either delivering exact results with reduced communication cost or controllably minimizing the cost with collaboration pruning, materialized by modified fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on various MoE-LLMs demonstrate that Occult can be faster than popular state-of-the-art inference or training frameworks (more than $1.5\times$ speed up across multiple tasks and models) with comparable or superior quality compared to the standard fine-tuning.

On Stopping Times of Power-one Sequential Tests: Tight Lower and Upper   Bounds,"We prove two lower bounds for stopping times of sequential tests between general composite nulls and alternatives. The first lower bound is for the setting where the type-1 error level $\alpha$ approaches zero, and equals $\log(1/\alpha)$ divided by a certain infimum KL divergence, termed $\operatorname{KL_{inf}}$. The second lower bound applies to the setting where $\alpha$ is fixed and $\operatorname{KL_{inf}}$ approaches 0 (meaning that the null and alternative sets are not separated) and equals $c \operatorname{KL_{inf}}^{-1} \log \log \operatorname{KL_{inf}}^{-1}$ for a universal constant $c > 0$. We also provide a sufficient condition for matching the upper bounds and show that this condition is met in several special cases. Given past work, these upper and lower bounds are unsurprising in their form; our main contribution is the generality in which they hold, for example, not requiring reference measures or compactness of the classes.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19952v1
Doubly Robust Fusion of Many Treatments for Policy Learning,"Individualized treatment rules/recommendations (ITRs) aim to improve patient outcomes by tailoring treatments to the characteristics of each individual. However, when there are many treatment groups, existing methods face significant challenges due to data sparsity within treatment groups and highly unbalanced covariate distributions across groups. To address these challenges, we propose a novel calibration-weighted treatment fusion procedure that robustly balances covariates across treatment groups and fuses similar treatments using a penalized working model. The fusion procedure ensures the recovery of latent treatment group structures when either the calibration model or the outcome model is correctly specified. In the fused treatment space, practitioners can seamlessly apply state-of-the-art ITR learning methods with the flexibility to utilize a subset of covariates, thereby achieving robustness while addressing practical concerns such as fairness. We establish theoretical guarantees, including consistency, the oracle property of treatment fusion, and regret bounds when integrated with multi-armed ITR learning methods such as policy trees. Simulation studies show superior group recovery and policy value compared to existing approaches. We illustrate the practical utility of our method using a nationwide electronic health record-derived de-identified database containing data from patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08092v1
Optimal Formats for Weight Quantisation,"Weight quantisation is an essential technique for enabling efficient training and deployment of modern deep learning models. However, the recipe book of quantisation formats is large and the formats are often chosen empirically. In this paper, we propose a framework for systematic design and analysis of quantisation formats. By connecting the question of format design with the classical quantisation theory, we show that the strong practical performance of popular formats comes from their ability to represent values using variable-length codes. Framing the optimisation problem as minimising the KL divergence between the original and quantised model outputs, the objective is aligned with minimising the squared quantisation error of the model parameters. We therefore develop and evaluate squared-error-optimal formats for known distributions, observing significant improvement of variable-length codes over fixed-length codes. Uniform quantisation followed by lossless compression with a variable-length code is shown to be optimal. However, we find that commonly used block formats and sparse outlier formats also outperform fixed-length codes, implying they also exploit variable-length encoding. Finally, by using the relationship between the Fisher information and KL divergence, we derive the optimal allocation of bit-widths to individual parameter tensors across the model's layers, saving up to 0.25 bits per parameter when tested with direct-cast quantisation of language models.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12988v1
Rapidly Varying Completely Random Measures for Modeling Extremely Sparse   Networks,"Completely random measures (CRMs) are fundamental to Bayesian nonparametric models, with applications in clustering, feature allocation, and network analysis. A key quantity of interest is the Laplace exponent, whose asymptotic behavior determines how the random structures scale. When the Laplace exponent grows nearly linearly - known as rapid variation - the induced models exhibit approximately linear growth in the number of clusters, features, or edges with sample size or network nodes. This regime is especially relevant for modeling sparse networks, yet existing CRM constructions lack tractability under rapid variation. We address this by introducing a new class of CRMs with index of variation $\alpha\in(0,1]$, defined as mixtures of stable or generalized gamma processes. These models offer interpretable parameters, include well-known CRMs as limiting cases, and retain analytical tractability through a tractable Laplace exponent and simple size-biased representation. We analyze the asymptotic properties of this CRM class and apply it to the Caron-Fox framework for sparse graphs. The resulting models produce networks with near-linear edge growth, aligning with empirical evidence from large-scale networks. Additionally, we present efficient algorithms for simulation and posterior inference, demonstrating practical advantages through experiments on real-world sparse network datasets.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13206v1
An Exponential Averaging Process with Strong Convergence Properties,"Averaging, or smoothing, is a fundamental approach to obtain stable, de-noised estimates from noisy observations. In certain scenarios, observations made along trajectories of random dynamical systems are of particular interest. One popular smoothing technique for such a scenario is exponential moving averaging (EMA), which assigns observations a weight that decreases exponentially in their age, thus giving younger observations a larger weight. However, EMA fails to enjoy strong stochastic convergence properties, which stems from the fact that the weight assigned to the youngest observation is constant over time, preventing the noise in the averaged quantity from decreasing to zero. In this work, we consider an adaptation to EMA, which we call $p$-EMA, where the weights assigned to the last observations decrease to zero at a subharmonic rate. We provide stochastic convergence guarantees for this kind of averaging under mild assumptions on the autocorrelations of the underlying random dynamical system. We further discuss the implications of our results for a recently introduced adaptive step size control for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which uses $p$-EMA for averaging noisy observations.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10605v1
PAC-Bayesian risk bounds for fully connected deep neural network with   Gaussian priors,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a powerful methodology with significant practical successes in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. Recent works have demonstrated that sparsely connected DNNs with carefully designed architectures can achieve minimax estimation rates under classical smoothness assumptions. However, subsequent studies revealed that simple fully connected DNNs can achieve comparable convergence rates, challenging the necessity of sparsity. Theoretical advances in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have been more fragmented. Much of those work has concentrated on sparse networks, leaving the theoretical properties of fully connected BNNs underexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by investigating fully connected Bayesian DNNs with Gaussian prior using PAC-Bayes bounds. We establish upper bounds on the prediction risk for a probabilistic deep neural network method, showing that these bounds match (up to logarithmic factors) the minimax-optimal rates in Besov space, for both nonparametric regression and binary classification with logistic loss. Importantly, our results hold for a broad class of practical activation functions that are Lipschitz continuous.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04341v1
The power of fine-grained experts: Granularity boosts expressivity in   Mixture of Experts,"Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are increasingly central to frontier model architectures. By selectively activating parameters, they reduce computational cost while scaling total parameter count. This paper investigates the impact of the number of active experts, termed granularity, comparing architectures with many (e.g., 8 per layer in DeepSeek) to those with fewer (e.g., 1 per layer in Llama-4 models). We prove an exponential separation in network expressivity based on this design parameter, suggesting that models benefit from higher granularity. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings and illustrate this separation.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06839v1
Understanding the Capabilities of Molecular Graph Neural Networks in   Materials Science Through Multimodal Learning and Physical Context Encoding,"Molecular graph neural networks (GNNs) often focus exclusively on XYZ-based geometric representations and thus overlook valuable chemical context available in public databases like PubChem. This work introduces a multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptors, such as IUPAC names, molecular formulas, physicochemical properties, and synonyms, alongside molecular graphs. A gated fusion mechanism balances geometric and textual features, allowing models to exploit complementary information. Experiments on benchmark datasets indicate that adding textual data yields notable improvements for certain electronic properties, while gains remain limited for others. Furthermore, the GNN architectures display similar performance patterns (improving and deteriorating on analogous targets), suggesting they learn comparable representations rather than distinctly different physical insights.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12137v1
Adaptive Linear Embedding for Nonstationary High-Dimensional   Optimization,"Bayesian Optimization (BO) in high-dimensional spaces remains fundamentally limited by the curse of dimensionality and the rigidity of global low-dimensional assumptions. While Random EMbedding Bayesian Optimization (REMBO) mitigates this via linear projections into low-dimensional subspaces, it typically assumes a single global embedding and a stationary objective. In this work, we introduce Self-Adaptive embedding REMBO (SA-REMBO), a novel framework that generalizes REMBO to support multiple random Gaussian embeddings, each capturing a different local subspace structure of the high-dimensional objective. An index variable governs the embedding choice and is jointly modeled with the latent optimization variable via a product kernel in a Gaussian Process surrogate. This enables the optimizer to adaptively select embeddings conditioned on location, effectively capturing locally varying effective dimensionality, nonstationarity, and heteroscedasticity in the objective landscape. We theoretically analyze the expressiveness and stability of the index-conditioned product kernel and empirically demonstrate the advantage of our method across synthetic and real-world high-dimensional benchmarks, where traditional REMBO and other low-rank BO methods fail. Our results establish SA-REMBO as a powerful and flexible extension for scalable BO in complex, structured design spaces.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11281v1
Reinforcement Learning for Individual Optimal Policy from Heterogeneous   Data,"Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find optimal policies in dynamic environments in order to maximize the expected total rewards by leveraging pre-collected data. Learning from heterogeneous data is one of the fundamental challenges in offline RL. Traditional methods focus on learning an optimal policy for all individuals with pre-collected data from a single episode or homogeneous batch episodes, and thus, may result in a suboptimal policy for a heterogeneous population. In this paper, we propose an individualized offline policy optimization framework for heterogeneous time-stationary Markov decision processes (MDPs). The proposed heterogeneous model with individual latent variables enables us to efficiently estimate the individual Q-functions, and our Penalized Pessimistic Personalized Policy Learning (P4L) algorithm guarantees a fast rate on the average regret under a weak partial coverage assumption on behavior policies. In addition, our simulation studies and a real data application demonstrate the superior numerical performance of the proposed method compared with existing methods.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09496v1
VenusX: Unlocking Fine-Grained Functional Understanding of Proteins,"Deep learning models have driven significant progress in predicting protein function and interactions at the protein level. While these advancements have been invaluable for many biological applications such as enzyme engineering and function annotation, a more detailed perspective is essential for understanding protein functional mechanisms and evaluating the biological knowledge captured by models. To address this demand, we introduce VenusX, the first large-scale benchmark for fine-grained functional annotation and function-based protein pairing at the residue, fragment, and domain levels. VenusX comprises three major task categories across six types of annotations, including residue-level binary classification, fragment-level multi-class classification, and pairwise functional similarity scoring for identifying critical active sites, binding sites, conserved sites, motifs, domains, and epitopes. The benchmark features over 878,000 samples curated from major open-source databases such as InterPro, BioLiP, and SAbDab. By providing mixed-family and cross-family splits at three sequence identity thresholds, our benchmark enables a comprehensive assessment of model performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. For baseline evaluation, we assess a diverse set of popular and open-source models, including pre-trained protein language models, sequence-structure hybrids, structure-based methods, and alignment-based techniques. Their performance is reported across all benchmark datasets and evaluation settings using multiple metrics, offering a thorough comparison and a strong foundation for future research. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/ai4protein/VenusX.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11812v1
Score-Debiased Kernel Density Estimation,"We propose a novel method for density estimation that leverages an estimated score function to debias kernel density estimation (SD-KDE). In our approach, each data point is adjusted by taking a single step along the score function with a specific choice of step size, followed by standard KDE with a modified bandwidth. The step size and modified bandwidth are chosen to remove the leading order bias in the KDE. Our experiments on synthetic tasks in 1D, 2D and on MNIST, demonstrate that our proposed SD-KDE method significantly reduces the mean integrated squared error compared to the standard Silverman KDE, even with noisy estimates in the score function. These results underscore the potential of integrating score-based corrections into nonparametric density estimation.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19084v1
Hypothesis-free discovery from epidemiological data by automatic   detection and local inference for tree-based nonlinearities and interactions,"In epidemiological settings, Machine Learning (ML) is gaining popularity for hypothesis-free discovery of risk (or protective) factors. Although ML is strong at discovering non-linearities and interactions, this power is currently compromised by a lack of reliable inference. Although local measures of feature effect can be combined with tree ensembles, uncertainty quantifications for these measures remain only partially available and oftentimes unsatisfactory. We propose RuleSHAP, a framework for using rule-based, hypothesis-free discovery that combines sparse Bayesian regression, tree ensembles and Shapley values in a one-step procedure that both detects and tests complex patterns at the individual level. To ease computation, we derive a formula that computes marginal Shapley values more efficiently for our setting. We demonstrate the validity of our framework on simulated data. To illustrate, we apply our machinery to data from an epidemiological cohort to detect and infer several effects for high cholesterol and blood pressure, such as nonlinear interaction effects between features like age, sex, ethnicity, BMI and glucose level.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00571v1
Unsupervised Port Berth Identification from Automatic Identification   System Data,"Port berthing sites are regions of high interest for monitoring and optimizing port operations. Data sourced from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) can be superimposed on berths enabling their real-time monitoring and revealing long-term utilization patterns. Ultimately, insights from multiple berths can uncover bottlenecks, and lead to the optimization of the underlying supply chain of the port and beyond. However, publicly available documentation of port berths, even when available, is frequently incomplete - e.g. there may be missing berths or inaccuracies such as incorrect boundary boxes - necessitating a more robust, data-driven approach to port berth localization. In this context, we propose an unsupervised spatial modeling method that leverages AIS data clustering and hyperparameter optimization to identify berthing sites. Trained on one month of freely available AIS data and evaluated across ports of varying sizes, our models significantly outperform competing methods, achieving a mean Bhattacharyya distance of 0.85 when comparing Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) trained on separate data splits, compared to 13.56 for the best existing method. Qualitative comparison with satellite images and existing berth labels further supports the superiority of our method, revealing more precise berth boundaries and improved spatial resolution across diverse port environments.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12046v1
Generative Modeling of Random Fields from Limited Data via Constrained   Latent Flow Matching,"Deep generative models are promising tools for science and engineering, but their reliance on abundant, high-quality data limits applicability. We present a novel framework for generative modeling of random fields (probability distributions over continuous functions) that incorporates domain knowledge to supplement limited, sparse, and indirect data. The foundation of the approach is latent flow matching, where generative modeling occurs on compressed function representations in the latent space of a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE). Innovations include the adoption of a function decoder within the VAE and integration of physical/statistical constraints into the VAE training process. In this way, a latent function representation is learned that yields continuous random field samples satisfying domain-specific constraints when decoded, even in data-limited regimes. Efficacy is demonstrated on two challenging applications: wind velocity field reconstruction from sparse sensors and material property inference from a limited number of indirect measurements. Results show that the proposed framework achieves significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy compared to unconstrained methods and enables effective inference with relatively small training datasets that is intractable without constraints.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13007v1
Cybersecurity threat detection based on a UEBA framework using Deep   Autoencoders,"User and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA) is a broad branch of data analytics that attempts to build a normal behavioural profile in order to detect anomalous events. Among the techniques used to detect anomalies, Deep Autoencoders constitute one of the most promising deep learning models on UEBA tasks, allowing explainable detection of security incidents that could lead to the leak of personal data, hijacking of systems, or access to sensitive business information. In this study, we introduce the first implementation of an explainable UEBA-based anomaly detection framework that leverages Deep Autoencoders in combination with Doc2Vec to process both numerical and textual features. Additionally, based on the theoretical foundations of neural networks, we offer a novel proof demonstrating the equivalence of two widely used definitions for fully-connected neural networks. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework capability to detect real and synthetic anomalies effectively generated from real attack data, showing that the models provide not only correct identification of anomalies but also explainable results that enable the reconstruction of the possible origin of the anomaly. Our findings suggest that the proposed UEBA framework can be seamlessly integrated into enterprise environments, complementing existing security systems for explainable threat detection.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11542v1
A stochastic gradient method for trilevel optimization,"With the success that the field of bilevel optimization has seen in recent years, similar methodologies have started being applied to solving more difficult applications that arise in trilevel optimization. At the helm of these applications are new machine learning formulations that have been proposed in the trilevel context and, as a result, efficient and theoretically sound stochastic methods are required. In this work, we propose the first-ever stochastic gradient descent method for solving unconstrained trilevel optimization problems and provide a convergence theory that covers all forms of inexactness of the trilevel adjoint gradient, such as the inexact solutions of the middle-level and lower-level problems, inexact computation of the trilevel adjoint formula, and noisy estimates of the gradients, Hessians, Jacobians, and tensors of third-order derivatives involved. We also demonstrate the promise of our approach by providing numerical results on both synthetic trilevel problems and trilevel formulations for hyperparameter adversarial tuning.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06805v1
Balancing Interpretability and Flexibility in Modeling Diagnostic   Trajectories with an Embedded Neural Hawkes Process Model,"The Hawkes process (HP) is commonly used to model event sequences with self-reinforcing dynamics, including electronic health records (EHRs). Traditional HPs capture self-reinforcement via parametric impact functions that can be inspected to understand how each event modulates the intensity of others. Neural network-based HPs offer greater flexibility, resulting in improved fit and prediction performance, but at the cost of interpretability, which is often critical in healthcare. In this work, we aim to understand and improve upon this tradeoff. We propose a novel HP formulation in which impact functions are modeled by defining a flexible impact kernel, instantiated as a neural network, in event embedding space, which allows us to model large-scale event sequences with many event types. This approach is more flexible than traditional HPs yet more interpretable than other neural network approaches, and allows us to explicitly trade flexibility for interpretability by adding transformer encoder layers to further contextualize the event embeddings. Results show that our method accurately recovers impact functions in simulations, achieves competitive performance on MIMIC-IV procedure dataset, and gains clinically meaningful interpretation on XX-EHR with children diagnosis dataset even without transformer layers. This suggests that our flexible impact kernel is often sufficient to capture self-reinforcing dynamics in EHRs and other data effectively, implying that interpretability can be maintained without loss of performance.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21795v2
Pave Your Own Path: Graph Gradual Domain Adaptation on Fused   Gromov-Wasserstein Geodesics,"Graph neural networks, despite their impressive performance, are highly vulnerable to distribution shifts on graphs. Existing graph domain adaptation (graph DA) methods often implicitly assume a \textit{mild} shift between source and target graphs, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with \textit{large} shifts. Gradual domain adaptation (GDA) has emerged as a promising approach for addressing large shifts by gradually adapting the source model to the target domain via a path of unlabeled intermediate domains. Existing GDA methods exclusively focus on independent and identically distributed (IID) data with a predefined path, leaving their extension to \textit{non-IID graphs without a given path} an open challenge. To bridge this gap, we present Gadget, the first GDA framework for non-IID graph data. First (\textit{theoretical foundation}), the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance is adopted as the domain discrepancy for non-IID graphs, based on which, we derive an error bound revealing that the target domain error is proportional to the length of the path. Second (\textit{optimal path}), guided by the error bound, we identify the FGW geodesic as the optimal path, which can be efficiently generated by our proposed algorithm. The generated path can be seamlessly integrated with existing graph DA methods to handle large shifts on graphs, improving state-of-the-art graph DA methods by up to 6.8\% in node classification accuracy on real-world datasets.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12709v1
Exogenous Isomorphism for Counterfactual Identifiability,"This paper investigates $\sim_{\mathcal{L}_3}$-identifiability, a form of complete counterfactual identifiability within the Pearl Causal Hierarchy (PCH) framework, ensuring that all Structural Causal Models (SCMs) satisfying the given assumptions provide consistent answers to all causal questions. To simplify this problem, we introduce exogenous isomorphism and propose $\sim_{\mathrm{EI}}$-identifiability, reflecting the strength of model identifiability required for $\sim_{\mathcal{L}_3}$-identifiability. We explore sufficient assumptions for achieving $\sim_{\mathrm{EI}}$-identifiability in two special classes of SCMs: Bijective SCMs (BSCMs), based on counterfactual transport, and Triangular Monotonic SCMs (TM-SCMs), which extend $\sim_{\mathcal{L}_2}$-identifiability. Our results unify and generalize existing theories, providing theoretical guarantees for practical applications. Finally, we leverage neural TM-SCMs to address the consistency problem in counterfactual reasoning, with experiments validating both the effectiveness of our method and the correctness of the theory.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02212v1
Bounding Neyman-Pearson Region with $f$-Divergences,"The Neyman-Pearson region of a simple binary hypothesis testing is the set of points whose coordinates represent the false positive rate and false negative rate of some test. The lower boundary of this region is given by the Neyman-Pearson lemma, and is up to a coordinate change, equivalent to the optimal ROC curve. We establish a novel lower bound for the boundary in terms of any $f$-divergence. Since the bound generated by hockey-stick $f$-divergences characterizes the Neyman-Pearson boundary, this bound is best possible. In the case of KL divergence, this bound improves Pinsker's inequality. Furthermore, we obtain a closed-form refined upper bound for the Neyman-Pearson boundary in terms of the Chernoff $\alpha$-coefficient. Finally, we present methods for constructing pairs of distributions that can approximately or exactly realize any given Neyman-Pearson boundary.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08899v1
Near-Optimal Sample Complexities of Divergence-based S-rectangular   Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning,"Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DR-RL) has recently gained significant attention as a principled approach that addresses discrepancies between training and testing environments. To balance robustness, conservatism, and computational traceability, the literature has introduced DR-RL models with SA-rectangular and S-rectangular adversaries. While most existing statistical analyses focus on SA-rectangular models, owing to their algorithmic simplicity and the optimality of deterministic policies, S-rectangular models more accurately capture distributional discrepancies in many real-world applications and often yield more effective robust randomized policies. In this paper, we study the empirical value iteration algorithm for divergence-based S-rectangular DR-RL and establish near-optimal sample complexity bounds of $\widetilde{O}(|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|(1-\gamma)^{-4}\varepsilon^{-2})$, where $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\mathcal{S}|$ and $|\mathcal{A}|$ denote the cardinalities of the state and action spaces, and $\gamma$ is the discount factor. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first sample complexity results for divergence-based S-rectangular models that achieve optimal dependence on $|\mathcal{S}|$, $|\mathcal{A}|$, and $\varepsilon$ simultaneously. We further validate this theoretical dependence through numerical experiments on a robust inventory control problem and a theoretical worst-case example, demonstrating the fast learning performance of our proposed algorithm.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12202v1
InnateCoder: Learning Programmatic Options with Foundation Models,"Outside of transfer learning settings, reinforcement learning agents start their learning process from a clean slate. As a result, such agents have to go through a slow process to learn even the most obvious skills required to solve a problem. In this paper, we present InnateCoder, a system that leverages human knowledge encoded in foundation models to provide programmatic policies that encode ""innate skills"" in the form of temporally extended actions, or options. In contrast to existing approaches to learning options, InnateCoder learns them from the general human knowledge encoded in foundation models in a zero-shot setting, and not from the knowledge the agent gains by interacting with the environment. Then, InnateCoder searches for a programmatic policy by combining the programs encoding these options into larger and more complex programs. We hypothesized that InnateCoder's way of learning and using options could improve the sampling efficiency of current methods for learning programmatic policies. Empirical results in MicroRTS and Karel the Robot support our hypothesis, since they show that InnateCoder is more sample efficient than versions of the system that do not use options or learn them from experience.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12508v1
Lower Bounds for Greedy Teaching Set Constructions,"A fundamental open problem in learning theory is to characterize the best-case teaching dimension $\operatorname{TS}_{\min}$ of a concept class $\mathcal{C}$ with finite VC dimension $d$. Resolving this problem will, in particular, settle the conjectured upper bound on Recursive Teaching Dimension posed by [Simon and Zilles; COLT 2015]. Prior work used a natural greedy algorithm to construct teaching sets recursively, thereby proving upper bounds on $\operatorname{TS}_{\min}$, with the best known bound being $O(d^2)$ [Hu, Wu, Li, and Wang; COLT 2017]. In each iteration, this greedy algorithm chooses to add to the teaching set the $k$ labeled points that restrict the concept class the most. In this work, we prove lower bounds on the performance of this greedy approach for small $k$. Specifically, we show that for $k = 1$, the algorithm does not improve upon the halving-based bound of $O(\log(|\mathcal{C}|))$. Furthermore, for $k = 2$, we complement the upper bound of $O\left(\log(\log(|\mathcal{C}|))\right)$ from [Moran, Shpilka, Wigderson, and Yuhudayoff; FOCS 2015] with a matching lower bound. Most consequentially, our lower bound extends up to $k \le \lceil c d \rceil$ for small constant $c>0$: suggesting that studying higher-order interactions may be necessary to resolve the conjecture that $\operatorname{TS}_{\min} = O(d)$.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03223v1
DaringFed: A Dynamic Bayesian Persuasion Pricing for Online Federated   Learning under Two-sided Incomplete Information,"Online Federated Learning (OFL) is a real-time learning paradigm that sequentially executes parameter aggregation immediately for each random arriving client. To motivate clients to participate in OFL, it is crucial to offer appropriate incentives to offset the training resource consumption. However, the design of incentive mechanisms in OFL is constrained by the dynamic variability of Two-sided Incomplete Information (TII) concerning resources, where the server is unaware of the clients' dynamically changing computational resources, while clients lack knowledge of the real-time communication resources allocated by the server. To incentivize clients to participate in training by offering dynamic rewards to each arriving client, we design a novel Dynamic Bayesian persuasion pricing for online Federated learning (DaringFed) under TII. Specifically, we begin by formulating the interaction between the server and clients as a dynamic signaling and pricing allocation problem within a Bayesian persuasion game, and then demonstrate the existence of a unique Bayesian persuasion Nash equilibrium. By deriving the optimal design of DaringFed under one-sided incomplete information, we further analyze the approximate optimal design of DaringFed with a specific bound under TII. Finally, extensive evaluation conducted on real datasets demonstrate that DaringFed optimizes accuracy and converges speed by 16.99%, while experiments with synthetic datasets validate the convergence of estimate unknown values and the effectiveness of DaringFed in improving the server's utility by up to 12.6%.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05842v1
Active Learning on Synthons for Molecular Design,"Exhaustive virtual screening is highly informative but often intractable against the expensive objective functions involved in modern drug discovery. This problem is exacerbated in combinatorial contexts such as multi-vector expansion, where molecular spaces can quickly become ultra-large. Here, we introduce Scalable Active Learning via Synthon Acquisition (SALSA): a simple algorithm applicable to multi-vector expansion which extends pool-based active learning to non-enumerable spaces by factoring modeling and acquisition over synthon or fragment choices. Through experiments on ligand- and structure-based objectives, we highlight SALSA's sample efficiency, and its ability to scale to spaces of trillions of compounds. Further, we demonstrate application toward multi-parameter objective design tasks on three protein targets - finding SALSA-generated molecules have comparable chemical property profiles to known bioactives, and exhibit greater diversity and higher scores over an industry-leading generative approach.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12913v1
A Tutorial on Discriminative Clustering and Mutual Information,"To cluster data is to separate samples into distinctive groups that should ideally have some cohesive properties. Today, numerous clustering algorithms exist, and their differences lie essentially in what can be perceived as ``cohesive properties''. Therefore, hypotheses on the nature of clusters must be set: they can be either generative or discriminative. As the last decade witnessed the impressive growth of deep clustering methods that involve neural networks to handle high-dimensional data often in a discriminative manner; we concentrate mainly on the discriminative hypotheses. In this paper, our aim is to provide an accessible historical perspective on the evolution of discriminative clustering methods and notably how the nature of assumptions of the discriminative models changed over time: from decision boundaries to invariance critics. We notably highlight how mutual information has been a historical cornerstone of the progress of (deep) discriminative clustering methods. We also show some known limitations of mutual information and how discriminative clustering methods tried to circumvent those. We then discuss the challenges that discriminative clustering faces with respect to the selection of the number of clusters. Finally, we showcase these techniques using the dedicated Python package, GemClus, that we have developed for discriminative clustering.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04484v1
Efficient Implementation of Gaussian Process Regression Accelerated   Saddle Point Searches with Application to Molecular Reactions,"The task of locating first order saddle points on high-dimensional surfaces describing the variation of energy as a function of atomic coordinates is an essential step for identifying the mechanism and estimating the rate of thermally activated events within the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. When combined directly with electronic structure calculations, the number of energy and atomic force evaluations needed for convergence is a primary issue. Here, we describe an efficient implementation of Gaussian process regression (GPR) acceleration of the minimum mode following method where a dimer is used to estimate the lowest eigenmode of the Hessian. A surrogate energy surface is constructed and updated after each electronic structure calculation. The method is applied to a test set of 500 molecular reactions previously generated by Hermez and coworkers [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 18, 6974 (2022)]. An order of magnitude reduction in the number of electronic structure calculations needed to reach the saddle point configurations is obtained by using the GPR compared to the dimer method. Despite the wide range in stiffness of the molecular degrees of freedom, the calculations are carried out using Cartesian coordinates and are found to require similar number of electronic structure calculations as an elaborate internal coordinate method implemented in the Sella software package. The present implementation of the GPR surrogate model in C++ is efficient enough for the wall time of the saddle point searches to be reduced in 3 out of 4 cases even though the calculations are carried out at a low Hartree-Fock level.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12519v1
Sharp Gaussian approximations for Decentralized Federated Learning,"Federated Learning has gained traction in privacy-sensitive collaborative environments, with local SGD emerging as a key optimization method in decentralized settings. While its convergence properties are well-studied, asymptotic statistical guarantees beyond convergence remain limited. In this paper, we present two generalized Gaussian approximation results for local SGD and explore their implications. First, we prove a Berry-Esseen theorem for the final local SGD iterates, enabling valid multiplier bootstrap procedures. Second, motivated by robustness considerations, we introduce two distinct time-uniform Gaussian approximations for the entire trajectory of local SGD. The time-uniform approximations support Gaussian bootstrap-based tests for detecting adversarial attacks. Extensive simulations are provided to support our theoretical results.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08125v1
Q-Learning with Clustered-SMART (cSMART) Data: Examining Moderators in   the Construction of Clustered Adaptive Interventions,"A clustered adaptive intervention (cAI) is a pre-specified sequence of decision rules that guides practitioners on how best - and based on which measures - to tailor cluster-level intervention to improve outcomes at the level of individuals within the clusters. A clustered sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (cSMART) is a type of trial that is used to inform the empirical development of a cAI. The most common type of secondary aim in a cSMART focuses on assessing causal effect moderation by candidate tailoring variables. We introduce a clustered Q-learning framework with the M-out-of-N Cluster Bootstrap using data from a cSMART to evaluate whether a set of candidate tailoring variables may be useful in defining an optimal cAI. This approach could construct confidence intervals (CI) with near-nominal coverage to assess parameters indexing the causal effect moderation function. Specifically, it allows reliable inferences concerning the utility of candidate tailoring variables in constructing a cAI that maximizes a mean end-of-study outcome even when ""non-regularity"", a well-known challenge exists. Simulations demonstrate the numerical performance of the proposed method across varying non-regularity conditions and investigate the impact of varying number of clusters and intra-cluster correlation coefficient on CI coverage. Methods are applied on ADEPT dataset to inform the construction of a clinic-level cAI for improving evidence-based practice in treating mood disorders.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00822v1
Financial Data Analysis with Robust Federated Logistic Regression,"In this study, we focus on the analysis of financial data in a federated setting, wherein data is distributed across multiple clients or locations, and the raw data never leaves the local devices. Our primary focus is not only on the development of efficient learning frameworks (for protecting user data privacy) in the field of federated learning but also on the importance of designing models that are easier to interpret. In addition, we care about the robustness of the framework to outliers. To achieve these goals, we propose a robust federated logistic regression-based framework that strives to strike a balance between these goals. To verify the feasibility of our proposed framework, we carefully evaluate its performance not only on independently identically distributed (IID) data but also on non-IID data, especially in scenarios involving outliers. Extensive numerical results collected from multiple public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve comparable performance to those of classical centralized algorithms, such as Logistical Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors, in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20250v1
Nonparametric Instrumental Variable Inference with Many Weak Instruments,"We study inference on linear functionals in the nonparametric instrumental variable (NPIV) problem with a discretely-valued instrument under a many-weak-instruments asymptotic regime, where the number of instrument values grows with the sample size. A key motivating example is estimating long-term causal effects in a new experiment with only short-term outcomes, using past experiments to instrument for the effect of short- on long-term outcomes. Here, the assignment to a past experiment serves as the instrument: we have many past experiments but only a limited number of units in each. Since the structural function is nonparametric but constrained by only finitely many moment restrictions, point identification typically fails. To address this, we consider linear functionals of the minimum-norm solution to the moment restrictions, which is always well-defined. As the number of instrument levels grows, these functionals define an approximating sequence to a target functional, replacing point identification with a weaker asymptotic notion suited to discrete instruments. Extending the Jackknife Instrumental Variable Estimator (JIVE) beyond the classical parametric setting, we propose npJIVE, a nonparametric estimator for solutions to linear inverse problems with many weak instruments. We construct automatic debiased machine learning estimators for linear functionals of both the structural function and its minimum-norm projection, and establish their efficiency in the many-weak-instruments regime.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07729v1
Missing Data Imputation by Reducing Mutual Information with Rectified   Flows,"This paper introduces a novel iterative method for missing data imputation that sequentially reduces the mutual information between data and their corresponding missing mask. Inspired by GAN-based approaches, which train generators to decrease the predictability of missingness patterns, our method explicitly targets the reduction of mutual information. Specifically, our algorithm iteratively minimizes the KL divergence between the joint distribution of the imputed data and missing mask, and the product of their marginals from the previous iteration. We show that the optimal imputation under this framework corresponds to solving an ODE, whose velocity field minimizes a rectified flow training objective. We further illustrate that some existing imputation techniques can be interpreted as approximate special cases of our mutual-information-reducing framework. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the efficacy of our proposed approach, demonstrating superior imputation performance.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11749v1
SIM-Shapley: A Stable and Computationally Efficient Approach to Shapley   Value Approximation,"Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is essential for trustworthy machine learning (ML), particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance. Shapley value (SV) methods provide a principled framework for feature attribution in complex models but incur high computational costs, limiting their scalability in high-dimensional settings. We propose Stochastic Iterative Momentum for Shapley Value Approximation (SIM-Shapley), a stable and efficient SV approximation method inspired by stochastic optimization. We analyze variance theoretically, prove linear $Q$-convergence, and demonstrate improved empirical stability and low bias in practice on real-world datasets. In our numerical experiments, SIM-Shapley reduces computation time by up to 85% relative to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining comparable feature attribution quality. Beyond feature attribution, our stochastic mini-batch iterative framework extends naturally to a broader class of sample average approximation problems, offering a new avenue for improving computational efficiency with stability guarantees. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/nliulab/SIM-Shapley.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08198v1
A Langevin sampling algorithm inspired by the Adam optimizer,"We present a framework for adaptive-stepsize MCMC sampling based on time-rescaled Langevin dynamics, in which the stepsize variation is dynamically driven by an additional degree of freedom. Our approach augments the phase space by an additional variable which in turn defines a time reparameterization. The use of an auxiliary relaxation equation allows accumulation of a moving average of a local monitor function and provides for precise control of the timestep while circumventing the need to modify the drift term in the physical system. Our algorithm is straightforward to implement and can be readily combined with any off-the-peg fixed-stepsize Langevin integrator. As a particular example, we consider control of the stepsize by monitoring the norm of the log-posterior gradient, which takes inspiration from the Adam optimizer, the stepsize being automatically reduced in regions of steep change of the log posterior and increased on plateaus, improving numerical stability and convergence speed. As in Adam, the stepsize variation depends on the recent history of the gradient norm, which enhances stability and improves accuracy compared to more immediate control approaches. We demonstrate the potential benefit of this method--both in accuracy and in stability--in numerical experiments including Neal's funnel and a Bayesian neural network for classification of MNIST data.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18911v1
Road Segmentation for ADAS/AD Applications,"Accurate road segmentation is essential for autonomous driving and ADAS, enabling effective navigation in complex environments. This study examines how model architecture and dataset choice affect segmentation by training a modified VGG-16 on the Comma10k dataset and a modified U-Net on the KITTI Road dataset. Both models achieved high accuracy, with cross-dataset testing showing VGG-16 outperforming U-Net despite U-Net being trained for more epochs. We analyze model performance using metrics such as F1-score, mean intersection over union, and precision, discussing how architecture and dataset impact results.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12206v1
RGNMR: A Gauss-Newton method for robust matrix completion with   theoretical guarantees,"Recovering a low rank matrix from a subset of its entries, some of which may be corrupted, is known as the robust matrix completion (RMC) problem. Existing RMC methods have several limitations: they require a relatively large number of observed entries; they may fail under overparametrization, when their assumed rank is higher than the correct one; and many of them fail to recover even mildly ill-conditioned matrices. In this paper we propose a novel RMC method, denoted $\texttt{RGNMR}$, which overcomes these limitations. $\texttt{RGNMR}$ is a simple factorization-based iterative algorithm, which combines a Gauss-Newton linearization with removal of entries suspected to be outliers. On the theoretical front, we prove that under suitable assumptions, $\texttt{RGNMR}$ is guaranteed exact recovery of the underlying low rank matrix. Our theoretical results improve upon the best currently known for factorization-based methods. On the empirical front, we show via several simulations the advantages of $\texttt{RGNMR}$ over existing RMC methods, and in particular its ability to handle a small number of observed entries, overparameterization of the rank and ill-conditioned matrices.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12919v1
On the expressivity of deep Heaviside networks,"We show that deep Heaviside networks (DHNs) have limited expressiveness but that this can be overcome by including either skip connections or neurons with linear activation. We provide lower and upper bounds for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimensions and approximation rates of these network classes. As an application, we derive statistical convergence rates for DHN fits in the nonparametric regression model.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00110v1
Fair Clustering via Alignment,"Algorithmic fairness in clustering aims to balance the proportions of instances assigned to each cluster with respect to a given sensitive attribute. While recently developed fair clustering algorithms optimize clustering objectives under specific fairness constraints, their inherent complexity or approximation often results in suboptimal clustering utility or numerical instability in practice. To resolve these limitations, we propose a new fair clustering algorithm based on a novel decomposition of the fair K-means clustering objective function. The proposed algorithm, called Fair Clustering via Alignment (FCA), operates by alternately (i) finding a joint probability distribution to align the data from different protected groups, and (ii) optimizing cluster centers in the aligned space. A key advantage of FCA is that it theoretically guarantees approximately optimal clustering utility for any given fairness level without complex constraints, thereby enabling high-utility fair clustering in practice. Experiments show that FCA outperforms existing methods by (i) attaining a superior trade-off between fairness level and clustering utility, and (ii) achieving near-perfect fairness without numerical instability.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09131v1
Generate-then-Verify: Reconstructing Data from Limited Published   Statistics,"We study the problem of reconstructing tabular data from aggregate statistics, in which the attacker aims to identify interesting claims about the sensitive data that can be verified with 100% certainty given the aggregates. Successful attempts in prior work have conducted studies in settings where the set of published statistics is rich enough that entire datasets can be reconstructed with certainty. In our work, we instead focus on the regime where many possible datasets match the published statistics, making it impossible to reconstruct the entire private dataset perfectly (i.e., when approaches in prior work fail). We propose the problem of partial data reconstruction, in which the goal of the adversary is to instead output a $\textit{subset}$ of rows and/or columns that are $\textit{guaranteed to be correct}$. We introduce a novel integer programming approach that first $\textbf{generates}$ a set of claims and then $\textbf{verifies}$ whether each claim holds for all possible datasets consistent with the published aggregates. We evaluate our approach on the housing-level microdata from the U.S. Decennial Census release, demonstrating that privacy violations can still persist even when information published about such data is relatively sparse.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21199v1
Koopman Autoencoders Learn Neural Representation Dynamics,"This paper explores a simple question: can we model the internal transformations of a neural network using dynamical systems theory? We introduce Koopman autoencoders to capture how neural representations evolve through network layers, treating these representations as states in a dynamical system. Our approach learns a surrogate model that predicts how neural representations transform from input to output, with two key advantages. First, by way of lifting the original states via an autoencoder, it operates in a linear space, making editing the dynamics straightforward. Second, it preserves the topologies of the original representations by regularizing the autoencoding objective. We demonstrate that these surrogate models naturally replicate the progressive topological simplification observed in neural networks. As a practical application, we show how our approach enables targeted class unlearning in the Yin-Yang and MNIST classification tasks.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12809v1
Good Things Come in Pairs: Paired Autoencoders for Inverse Problems,"In this book chapter, we discuss recent advances in data-driven approaches for inverse problems. In particular, we focus on the \emph{paired autoencoder} framework, which has proven to be a powerful tool for solving inverse problems in scientific computing. The paired autoencoder framework is a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both data-driven and model-based methods by projecting both the data and the quantity of interest into a latent space and mapping these latent spaces to provide surrogate forward and inverse mappings. We illustrate the advantages of this approach through numerical experiments, including seismic imaging and classical inpainting: nonlinear and linear inverse problems, respectively. Although the paired autoencoder framework is likelihood-free, it generates multiple data- and model-based reconstruction metrics that help assess whether examples are in or out of distribution. In addition to direct model estimates from data, the paired autoencoder enables latent-space refinement to fit the observed data accurately. Numerical experiments show that this procedure, combined with the latent-space initial guess, is essential for high-quality estimates, even when data noise exceeds the training regime. We also introduce two novel variants that combine variational and paired autoencoder ideas, maintaining the original benefits while enabling sampling for uncertainty analysis.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06549v1
Temporal Query Network for Efficient Multivariate Time Series   Forecasting,"Sufficiently modeling the correlations among variables (aka channels) is crucial for achieving accurate multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). In this paper, we propose a novel technique called Temporal Query (TQ) to more effectively capture multivariate correlations, thereby improving model performance in MTSF tasks. Technically, the TQ technique employs periodically shifted learnable vectors as queries in the attention mechanism to capture global inter-variable patterns, while the keys and values are derived from the raw input data to encode local, sample-level correlations. Building upon the TQ technique, we develop a simple yet efficient model named Temporal Query Network (TQNet), which employs only a single-layer attention mechanism and a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that TQNet learns more robust multivariate correlations, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across 12 challenging real-world datasets. Furthermore, TQNet achieves high efficiency comparable to linear-based methods even on high-dimensional datasets, balancing performance and computational cost. The code is available at: https://github.com/ACAT-SCUT/TQNet.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12917v1
Rethinking Label-specific Features for Label Distribution Learning,"Label distribution learning (LDL) is an emerging learning paradigm designed to capture the relative importance of labels for each instance. Label-specific features (LSFs), constructed by LIFT, have proven effective for learning tasks with label ambiguity by leveraging clustering-based prototypes for each label to re-characterize instances. However, directly introducing LIFT into LDL tasks can be suboptimal, as the prototypes it collects primarily reflect intra-cluster relationships while neglecting interactions among distinct clusters. Additionally, constructing LSFs using multi-perspective information, rather than relying solely on Euclidean distance, provides a more robust and comprehensive representation of instances, mitigating noise and bias that may arise from a single distance perspective. To address these limitations, we introduce Structural Anchor Points (SAPs) to capture inter-cluster interactions. This leads to a novel LSFs construction strategy, LIFT-SAP, which enhances LIFT by integrating both distance and direction information of each instance relative to SAPs. Furthermore, we propose a novel LDL algorithm, Label Distribution Learning via Label-specifIc FeaTure with SAPs (LDL-LIFT-SAP), which unifies multiple label description degrees predicted from different LSF spaces into a cohesive label distribution. Extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LIFT-SAP over LIFT, as well as the superiority of LDL-LIFT-SAP compared to seven other well-established algorithms.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19374v1
Context-Aware Online Conformal Anomaly Detection with Prediction-Powered   Data Acquisition,"Online anomaly detection is essential in fields such as cybersecurity, healthcare, and industrial monitoring, where promptly identifying deviations from expected behavior can avert critical failures or security breaches. While numerous anomaly scoring methods based on supervised or unsupervised learning have been proposed, current approaches typically rely on a continuous stream of real-world calibration data to provide assumption-free guarantees on the false discovery rate (FDR). To address the inherent challenges posed by limited real calibration data, we introduce context-aware prediction-powered conformal online anomaly detection (C-PP-COAD). Our framework strategically leverages synthetic calibration data to mitigate data scarcity, while adaptively integrating real data based on contextual cues. C-PP-COAD utilizes conformal p-values, active p-value statistics, and online FDR control mechanisms to maintain rigorous and reliable anomaly detection performance over time. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that C-PP-COAD significantly reduces dependency on real calibration data without compromising guaranteed FDR control.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01783v1
ALPCAH: Subspace Learning for Sample-wise Heteroscedastic Data,"Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data dimensionality reduction. However, some applications involve heterogeneous data that vary in quality due to noise characteristics associated with each data sample. Heteroscedastic methods aim to deal with such mixed data quality. This paper develops a subspace learning method, named ALPCAH, that can estimate the sample-wise noise variances and use this information to improve the estimate of the subspace basis associated with the low-rank structure of the data. Our method makes no distributional assumptions of the low-rank component and does not assume that the noise variances are known. Further, this method uses a soft rank constraint that does not require subspace dimension to be known. Additionally, this paper develops a matrix factorized version of ALPCAH, named LR-ALPCAH, that is much faster and more memory efficient at the cost of requiring subspace dimension to be known or estimated. Simulations and real data experiments show the effectiveness of accounting for data heteroscedasticity compared to existing algorithms.

JULI: Jailbreak Large Language Models by Self-Introspection,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained with safety alignment to prevent generating malicious content. Although some attacks have highlighted vulnerabilities in these safety-aligned LLMs, they typically have limitations, such as necessitating access to the model weights or the generation process. Since proprietary models through API-calling do not grant users such permissions, these attacks find it challenging to compromise them. In this paper, we propose Jailbreaking Using LLM Introspection (JULI), which jailbreaks LLMs by manipulating the token log probabilities, using a tiny plug-in block, BiasNet. JULI relies solely on the knowledge of the target LLM's predicted token log probabilities. It can effectively jailbreak API-calling LLMs under a black-box setting and knowing only top-$5$ token log probabilities. Our approach demonstrates superior effectiveness, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across multiple metrics.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11790v1
Testing Juntas Optimally with Samples,"We prove tight upper and lower bounds of $\Theta\left(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}\left( \sqrt{2^k \log\binom{n}{k} } + \log\binom{n}{k} \right)\right)$ on the number of samples required for distribution-free $k$-junta testing. This is the first tight bound for testing a natural class of Boolean functions in the distribution-free sample-based model. Our bounds also hold for the feature selection problem, showing that a junta tester must learn the set of relevant variables. For tolerant junta testing, we prove a sample lower bound of $\Omega(2^{(1-o(1)) k} + \log\binom{n}{k})$ showing that, unlike standard testing, there is no large gap between tolerant testing and learning.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04604v1
Machine Learning Applications Related to Suicide in Military and   Veterans: A Scoping Literature Review,"Suicide remains one of the main preventable causes of death among active service members and veterans. Early detection and prediction are crucial in suicide prevention. Machine learning techniques have yielded promising results in this area recently. This study aims to assess and summarize current research and provides a comprehensive review regarding the application of machine learning techniques in assessing and predicting suicidal ideation, attempts, and mortality among members of military and veteran populations.   A keyword search using PubMed, IEEE, ACM, and Google Scholar was conducted, and the PRISMA protocol was adopted for relevant study selection. Thirty-two articles met the inclusion criteria. These studies consistently identified risk factors relevant to mental health issues such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, prior attempts, physical health problems, and demographic characteristics.   Machine learning models applied in this area have demonstrated reasonable predictive accuracy. However, additional research gaps still exist. First, many studies have overlooked metrics that distinguish between false positives and negatives, such as positive predictive value and negative predictive value, which are crucial in the context of suicide prevention policies. Second, more dedicated approaches to handling survival and longitudinal data should be explored. Lastly, most studies focused on machine learning methods, with limited discussion of their connection to clinical rationales.   In summary, machine learning analyses have identified a wide range of risk factors associated with suicide in military populations. The diversity and complexity of these factors also demonstrates that effective prevention strategies must be comprehensive and flexible.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12220v1
A Learning-Based Ansatz Satisfying Boundary Conditions in Variational   Problems,"Recently, innovative adaptations of the Ritz Method incorporating deep learning have been developed, known as the Deep Ritz Method. This approach employs a neural network as the test function for variational problems. However, the neural network does not inherently satisfy the boundary conditions of the variational problem. To resolve this issue, the Deep Ritz Method introduces a penalty term into the functional of the variational problem, which can lead to misleading results during the optimization process. In this work, an ansatz is proposed that inherently satisfies the boundary conditions of the variational problem. The results demonstrate that the proposed ansatz not only eliminates misleading outcomes but also reduces complexity while maintaining accuracy, showcasing its practical effectiveness in addressing variational problems.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12430v1
Diffusion Models with Double Guidance: Generate with aggregated datasets,"Creating large-scale datasets for training high-performance generative models is often prohibitively expensive, especially when associated attributes or annotations must be provided. As a result, merging existing datasets has become a common strategy. However, the sets of attributes across datasets are often inconsistent, and their naive concatenation typically leads to block-wise missing conditions. This presents a significant challenge for conditional generative modeling when the multiple attributes are used jointly as conditions, thereby limiting the model's controllability and applicability. To address this issue, we propose a novel generative approach, Diffusion Model with Double Guidance, which enables precise conditional generation even when no training samples contain all conditions simultaneously. Our method maintains rigorous control over multiple conditions without requiring joint annotations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in molecular and image generation tasks, where it outperforms existing baselines both in alignment with target conditional distributions and in controllability under missing condition settings.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13213v1

A Path to Universal Neural Cellular Automata,"Cellular automata have long been celebrated for their ability to generate complex behaviors from simple, local rules, with well-known discrete models like Conway's Game of Life proven capable of universal computation. Recent advancements have extended cellular automata into continuous domains, raising the question of whether these systems retain the capacity for universal computation. In parallel, neural cellular automata have emerged as a powerful paradigm where rules are learned via gradient descent rather than manually designed. This work explores the potential of neural cellular automata to develop a continuous Universal Cellular Automaton through training by gradient descent. We introduce a cellular automaton model, objective functions and training strategies to guide neural cellular automata toward universal computation in a continuous setting. Our experiments demonstrate the successful training of fundamental computational primitives - such as matrix multiplication and transposition - culminating in the emulation of a neural network solving the MNIST digit classification task directly within the cellular automata state. These results represent a foundational step toward realizing analog general-purpose computers, with implications for understanding universal computation in continuous dynamics and advancing the automated discovery of complex cellular automata behaviors via machine learning.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13058v1
Ensemble Kalman filter for uncertainty in human language comprehension,"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are widely used in modeling sentence processing but often exhibit deterministic behavior, contrasting with human sentence comprehension, which manages uncertainty during ambiguous or unexpected inputs. This is exemplified by reversal anomalies-sentences with unexpected role reversals that challenge syntax and semantics-highlighting the limitations of traditional ANN models, such as the Sentence Gestalt (SG) Model. To address these limitations, we propose a Bayesian framework for sentence comprehension, applying an extension of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for Bayesian inference to quantify uncertainty. By framing language comprehension as a Bayesian inverse problem, this approach enhances the SG model's ability to reflect human sentence processing with respect to the representation of uncertainty. Numerical experiments and comparisons with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) demonstrate that Bayesian methods improve uncertainty representation, enabling the model to better approximate human cognitive processing when dealing with linguistic ambiguities.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02590v1
Adaptive Graph Unlearning,"Graph unlearning, which deletes graph elements such as nodes and edges from trained graph neural networks (GNNs), is crucial for real-world applications where graph data may contain outdated, inaccurate, or privacy-sensitive information. However, existing methods often suffer from (1) incomplete or over unlearning due to neglecting the distinct objectives of different unlearning tasks, and (2) inaccurate identification of neighbors affected by deleted elements across various GNN architectures. To address these limitations, we propose AGU, a novel Adaptive Graph Unlearning framework that flexibly adapts to diverse unlearning tasks and GNN architectures. AGU ensures the complete forgetting of deleted elements while preserving the integrity of the remaining graph. It also accurately identifies affected neighbors for each GNN architecture and prioritizes important ones to enhance unlearning performance. Extensive experiments on seven real-world graphs demonstrate that AGU outperforms existing methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and unlearning capability.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12614v1
DOLCE: Decomposing Off-Policy Evaluation/Learning into Lagged and   Current Effects,"Off-policy evaluation (OPE) and off-policy learning (OPL) for contextual bandit policies leverage historical data to evaluate and optimize a target policy. Most existing OPE/OPL methods--based on importance weighting or imputation--assume common support between the target and logging policies. When this assumption is violated, these methods typically require unstable extrapolation, truncation, or conservative strategies for individuals outside the common support assumption. However, such approaches can be inadequate in settings where explicit evaluation or optimization for such individuals is required. To address this issue, we propose DOLCE: Decomposing Off-policy evaluation/learning into Lagged and Current Effects, a novel estimator that leverages contextual information from multiple time points to decompose rewards into lagged and current effects. By incorporating both past and present contexts, DOLCE effectively handles individuals who violate the common support assumption. We show that the proposed estimator is unbiased under two assumptions--local correctness and conditional independence. Our experiments demonstrate that DOLCE achieves substantial improvements in OPE and OPL, particularly as the proportion of individuals outside the common support assumption increases.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00961v1
A Malliavin-Gamma calculus approach to Score Based Diffusion Generative   models for random fields,"We adopt a Gamma and Malliavin Calculi point of view in order to generalize Score-based diffusion Generative Models (SGMs) to an infinite-dimensional abstract Hilbertian setting. Particularly, we define the forward noising process using Dirichlet forms associated to the Cameron-Martin space of Gaussian measures and Wiener chaoses; whereas by relying on an abstract time-reversal formula, we show that the score function is a Malliavin derivative and it corresponds to a conditional expectation. This allows us to generalize SGMs to the infinite-dimensional setting. Moreover, we extend existing finite-dimensional entropic convergence bounds to this Hilbertian setting by highlighting the role played by the Cameron-Martin norm in the Fisher information of the data distribution. Lastly, we specify our discussion for spherical random fields, considering as source of noise a Whittle-Mat\'ern random spherical field.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13189v1
Incremental Uncertainty-aware Performance Monitoring with Active   Labeling Intervention,"We study the problem of monitoring machine learning models under gradual distribution shifts, where circumstances change slowly over time, often leading to unnoticed yet significant declines in accuracy. To address this, we propose Incremental Uncertainty-aware Performance Monitoring (IUPM), a novel label-free method that estimates performance changes by modeling gradual shifts using optimal transport. In addition, IUPM quantifies the uncertainty in the performance prediction and introduces an active labeling procedure to restore a reliable estimate under a limited labeling budget. Our experiments show that IUPM outperforms existing performance estimation baselines in various gradual shift scenarios and that its uncertainty awareness guides label acquisition more effectively compared to other strategies.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07023v1
Resolving Latency and Inventory Risk in Market Making with Reinforcement   Learning,"The latency of the exchanges in Market Making (MM) is inevitable due to hardware limitations, system processing times, delays in receiving data from exchanges, the time required for order transmission to reach the market, etc. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods for Market Making (MM) overlook the impact of these latency, which can lead to unintended order cancellations due to price discrepancies between decision and execution times and result in undesired inventory accumulation, exposing MM traders to increased market risk. Therefore, these methods cannot be applied in real MM scenarios. To address these issues, we first build a realistic MM environment with random delays of 30-100 milliseconds for order placement and market information reception, and implement a batch matching mechanism that collects orders within every 500 milliseconds before matching them all at once, simulating the batch auction mechanisms adopted by some exchanges. Then, we propose Relaver, an RL-based method for MM to tackle the latency and inventory risk issues. The three main contributions of Relaver are: i) we introduce an augmented state-action space that incorporates order hold time alongside price and volume, enabling Relaver to optimize execution strategies under latency constraints and time-priority matching mechanisms, ii) we leverage dynamic programming (DP) to guide the exploration of RL training for better policies, iii) we train a market trend predictor, which can guide the agent to intelligently adjust the inventory to reduce the risk. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on four real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsc{Relaver} significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art RL-based MM strategies across multiple metrics.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12465v1
Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference for   Computationally Expensive Models,"Bayesian inference typically relies on a large number of model evaluations to estimate posterior distributions. Established methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) can become computationally challenging. While ABI enables fast inference after training, generating sufficient training data still requires thousands of model simulations, which is infeasible for expensive models. Surrogate models offer a solution by providing approximate simulations at a lower computational cost, allowing the generation of large data sets for training. However, the introduced approximation errors and uncertainties can lead to overconfident posterior estimates. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference (UA-SABI) - a framework that combines surrogate modeling and ABI while explicitly quantifying and propagating surrogate uncertainties through the inference pipeline. Our experiments show that this approach enables reliable, fast, and repeated Bayesian inference for computationally expensive models, even under tight time constraints.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08683v1
Testing Identifiability and Transportability with Observational and   Experimental Data,"Transporting causal information learned from experiments in one population to another is a critical challenge in clinical research and decision-making. Causal transportability uses causal graphs to model differences between the source and target populations and identifies conditions under which causal effects learned from experiments can be reused in a different population. Similarly, causal identifiability identifies conditions under which causal effects can be estimated from observational data. However, these approaches rely on knowing the causal graph, which is often unavailable in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a Bayesian method for assessing whether Z-specific (conditional) causal effects are both identifiable and transportable, without knowing the causal graph. Our method combines experimental data from the source population with observational data from the target population to compute the probability that a causal effect is both identifiable from observational data and transportable. When this holds, we leverage both observational data from the target domain and experimental data from the source domain to obtain an unbiased, efficient estimator of the causal effect in the target population. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our method correctly identifies transportable causal effects and improves causal effect estimation.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12801v1
Mirror Mean-Field Langevin Dynamics,"The mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD) minimizes an entropy-regularized nonlinear convex functional on the Wasserstein space over $\mathbb{R}^d$, and has gained attention recently as a model for the gradient descent dynamics of interacting particle systems such as infinite-width two-layer neural networks. However, many problems of interest have constrained domains, which are not solved by existing mean-field algorithms due to the global diffusion term. We study the optimization of probability measures constrained to a convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ by proposing the \emph{mirror mean-field Langevin dynamics} (MMFLD), an extension of MFLD to the mirror Langevin framework. We obtain linear convergence guarantees for the continuous MMFLD via a uniform log-Sobolev inequality, and uniform-in-time propagation of chaos results for its time- and particle-discretized counterpart.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02621v1
Reverse-BSDE Monte Carlo,"Recently, there has been a growing interest in generative models based on diffusions driven by the empirical robustness of these methods in generating high-dimensional photorealistic images and the possibility of using the vast existing toolbox of stochastic differential equations. %This remarkable ability may stem from their capacity to model and generate multimodal distributions. In this work, we offer a novel perspective on the approach introduced in Song et al. (2021), shifting the focus from a ""learning"" problem to a ""sampling"" problem. To achieve this, we reformulate the equations governing diffusion-based generative models as a Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE), which avoids the well-known issue of pre-estimating the gradient of the log target density. The solution of this FBSDE is proved to be unique using non-standard techniques. Additionally, we propose a numerical solution to this problem, leveraging on Deep Learning techniques. This reformulation opens new pathways for sampling multidimensional distributions with densities known up to a normalization constant, a problem frequently encountered in Bayesian statistics.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06800v1
Localized Diffusion Models for High Dimensional Distributions Generation,"Diffusion models are the state-of-the-art tools for various generative tasks. However, estimating high-dimensional score functions makes them potentially suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD). This underscores the importance of better understanding and exploiting low-dimensional structure in the target distribution. In this work, we consider locality structure, which describes sparse dependencies between model components. Under locality structure, the score function is effectively low-dimensional, so that it can be estimated by a localized neural network with significantly reduced sample complexity. This motivates the localized diffusion model, where a localized score matching loss is used to train the score function within a localized hypothesis space. We prove that such localization enables diffusion models to circumvent CoD, at the price of additional localization error. Under realistic sample size scaling, we show both theoretically and numerically that a moderate localization radius can balance the statistical and localization error, leading to a better overall performance. The localized structure also facilitates parallel training of diffusion models, making it potentially more efficient for large-scale applications.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04417v1
A Robust Monotonic Single-Index Model for Skewed and Heavy-Tailed Data:   A Deep Neural Network Approach Applied to Periodontal Studies,"Periodontal pocket depth is a widely used biomarker for diagnosing risk of periodontal disease. However, pocket depth typically exhibits skewness and heavy-tailedness, and its relationship with clinical risk factors is often nonlinear. Motivated by periodontal studies, this paper develops a robust single-index modal regression framework for analyzing skewed and heavy-tailed data. Our method has the following novel features: (1) a flexible two-piece scale Student-$t$ error distribution that generalizes both normal and two-piece scale normal distributions; (2) a deep neural network with guaranteed monotonicity constraints to estimate the unknown single-index function; and (3) theoretical guarantees, including model identifiability and a universal approximation theorem. Our single-index model combines the flexibility of neural networks and the two-piece scale Student-$t$ distribution, delivering robust mode-based estimation that is resistant to outliers, while retaining clinical interpretability through parametric index coefficients. We demonstrate the performance of our method through simulation studies and an application to periodontal disease data from the HealthPartners Institute of Minnesota. The proposed methodology is implemented in the \textsf{R} package \href{https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.DNNSIM}{\textsc{DNNSIM}}.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02153v1
Equivariant non-linear maps for neural networks on homogeneous spaces,"This paper presents a novel framework for non-linear equivariant neural network layers on homogeneous spaces. The seminal work of Cohen et al. on equivariant $G$-CNNs on homogeneous spaces characterized the representation theory of such layers in the linear setting, finding that they are given by convolutions with kernels satisfying so-called steerability constraints. Motivated by the empirical success of non-linear layers, such as self-attention or input dependent kernels, we set out to generalize these insights to the non-linear setting. We derive generalized steerability constraints that any such layer needs to satisfy and prove the universality of our construction. The insights gained into the symmetry-constrained functional dependence of equivariant operators on feature maps and group elements informs the design of future equivariant neural network layers. We demonstrate how several common equivariant network architectures - $G$-CNNs, implicit steerable kernel networks, conventional and relative position embedded attention based transformers, and LieTransformers - may be derived from our framework.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20974v1
Optimal Sequential Recommendations: Exploiting User and Item Structure,"We consider an online model for recommendation systems, with each user being recommended an item at each time-step and providing 'like' or 'dislike' feedback. A latent variable model specifies the user preferences: both users and items are clustered into types. The model captures structure in both the item and user spaces, as used by item-item and user-user collaborative filtering algorithms. We study the situation in which the type preference matrix has i.i.d. entries. Our main contribution is an algorithm that simultaneously uses both item and user structures, proved to be near-optimal via corresponding information-theoretic lower bounds. In particular, our analysis highlights the sub-optimality of using only one of item or user structure (as is done in most collaborative filtering algorithms).",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19476v1
Confidence-Regulated Generative Diffusion Models for Reliable AI Agent   Migration in Vehicular Metaverses,"Vehicular metaverses are an emerging paradigm that merges intelligent transportation systems with virtual spaces, leveraging advanced digital twin and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to seamlessly integrate vehicles, users, and digital environments. In this paradigm, vehicular AI agents are endowed with environment perception, decision-making, and action execution capabilities, enabling real-time processing and analysis of multi-modal data to provide users with customized interactive services. Since vehicular AI agents require substantial resources for real-time decision-making, given vehicle mobility and network dynamics conditions, the AI agents are deployed in RoadSide Units (RSUs) with sufficient resources and dynamically migrated among them. However, AI agent migration requires frequent data exchanges, which may expose vehicular metaverses to potential cyber attacks. To this end, we propose a reliable vehicular AI agent migration framework, achieving reliable dynamic migration and efficient resource scheduling through cooperation between vehicles and RSUs. Additionally, we design a trust evaluation model based on the theory of planned behavior to dynamically quantify the reputation of RSUs, thereby better accommodating the personalized trust preferences of users. We then model the vehicular AI agent migration process as a partially observable markov decision process and develop a Confidence-regulated Generative Diffusion Model (CGDM) to efficiently generate AI agent migration decisions. Numerical results demonstrate that the CGDM algorithm significantly outperforms baseline methods in reducing system latency and enhancing robustness against cyber attacks.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12710v1
Wasserstein Convergence of Score-based Generative Models under   Semiconvexity and Discontinuous Gradients,"Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) approximate a data distribution by perturbing it with Gaussian noise and subsequently denoising it via a learned reverse diffusion process. These models excel at modeling complex data distributions and generating diverse samples, achieving state-of-the-art performance across domains such as computer vision, audio generation, reinforcement learning, and computational biology. Despite their empirical success, existing Wasserstein-2 convergence analysis typically assume strong regularity conditions-such as smoothness or strict log-concavity of the data distribution-that are rarely satisfied in practice. In this work, we establish the first non-asymptotic Wasserstein-2 convergence guarantees for SGMs targeting semiconvex distributions with potentially discontinuous gradients. Our upper bounds are explicit and sharp in key parameters, achieving optimal dependence of $O(\sqrt{d})$ on the data dimension $d$ and convergence rate of order one. The framework accommodates a wide class of practically relevant distributions, including symmetric modified half-normal distributions, Gaussian mixtures, double-well potentials, and elastic net potentials. By leveraging semiconvexity without requiring smoothness assumptions on the potential such as differentiability, our results substantially broaden the theoretical foundations of SGMs, bridging the gap between empirical success and rigorous guarantees in non-smooth, complex data regimes.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03432v1
Adaptive Resolving Methods for Reinforcement Learning with Function   Approximations,"Reinforcement learning (RL) problems are fundamental in online decision-making and have been instrumental in finding an optimal policy for Markov decision processes (MDPs). Function approximations are usually deployed to handle large or infinite state-action space. In our work, we consider the RL problems with function approximation and we develop a new algorithm to solve it efficiently. Our algorithm is based on the linear programming (LP) reformulation and it resolves the LP at each iteration improved with new data arrival. Such a resolving scheme enables our algorithm to achieve an instance-dependent sample complexity guarantee, more precisely, when we have $N$ data, the output of our algorithm enjoys an instance-dependent $\tilde{O}(1/N)$ suboptimality gap. In comparison to the $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ worst-case guarantee established in the previous literature, our instance-dependent guarantee is tighter when the underlying instance is favorable, and the numerical experiments also reveal the efficient empirical performances of our algorithms.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12037v1
Incentivize Contribution and Learn Parameters Too: Federated Learning   with Strategic Data Owners,"Classical federated learning (FL) assumes that the clients have a limited amount of noisy data with which they voluntarily participate and contribute towards learning a global, more accurate model in a principled manner. The learning happens in a distributed fashion without sharing the data with the center. However, these methods do not consider the incentive of an agent for participating and contributing to the process, given that data collection and running a distributed algorithm is costly for the clients. The question of rationality of contribution has been asked recently in the literature and some results exist that consider this problem. This paper addresses the question of simultaneous parameter learning and incentivizing contribution, which distinguishes it from the extant literature. Our first mechanism incentivizes each client to contribute to the FL process at a Nash equilibrium and simultaneously learn the model parameters. However, this equilibrium outcome can be away from the optimal, where clients contribute with their full data and the algorithm learns the optimal parameters. We propose a second mechanism with monetary transfers that is budget balanced and enables the full data contribution along with optimal parameter learning. Large scale experiments with real (federated) datasets (CIFAR-10, FeMNIST, and Twitter) show that these algorithms converge quite fast in practice, yield good welfare guarantees, and better model performance for all agents.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12010v1
Unpacking Positional Encoding in Transformers: A Spectral Analysis of   Content-Position Coupling,"Positional encoding (PE) is essential for enabling Transformers to model sequential structure. However, the mechanisms by which different PE schemes couple token content and positional information-and how these mechanisms influence model dynamics-remain theoretically underexplored. In this work, we present a unified framework that analyzes PE through the spectral properties of Toeplitz and related matrices derived from attention logits. We show that multiplicative content-position coupling-exemplified by Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) via a Hadamard product with a Toeplitz matrix-induces spectral contraction, which theoretically improves optimization stability and efficiency. Guided by this theory, we construct synthetic tasks that contrast content-position dependent and content-position independent settings, and evaluate a range of PE methods. Our experiments reveal strong alignment with theory: RoPE consistently outperforms other methods on position-sensitive tasks and induces ""single-head deposit"" patterns in early layers, indicating localized positional processing. Further analyses show that modifying the method and timing of PE coupling, such as MLA in Deepseek-V3, can effectively mitigate this concentration. These results establish explicit content-relative mixing with relative-position Toeplitz signals as a key principle for effective PE design and provide new insight into how positional structure is integrated in Transformer architectures.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13027v1
Minimum-Excess-Work Guidance,"We propose a regularization framework inspired by thermodynamic work for guiding pre-trained probability flow generative models (e.g., continuous normalizing flows or diffusion models) by minimizing excess work, a concept rooted in statistical mechanics and with strong conceptual connections to optimal transport. Our approach enables efficient guidance in sparse-data regimes common to scientific applications, where only limited target samples or partial density constraints are available. We introduce two strategies: Path Guidance for sampling rare transition states by concentrating probability mass on user-defined subsets, and Observable Guidance for aligning generated distributions with experimental observables while preserving entropy. We demonstrate the framework's versatility on a coarse-grained protein model, guiding it to sample transition configurations between folded/unfolded states and correct systematic biases using experimental data. The method bridges thermodynamic principles with modern generative architectures, offering a principled, efficient, and physics-inspired alternative to standard fine-tuning in data-scarce domains. Empirical results highlight improved sample efficiency and bias reduction, underscoring its applicability to molecular simulations and beyond.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13375v1
Nonnegative Low-rank Matrix Recovery Can Have Spurious Local Minima,"The classical low-rank matrix recovery problem is well-known to exhibit \emph{benign nonconvexity} under the restricted isometry property (RIP): local optimization is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum, where the ground truth is recovered. We investigate whether benign nonconvexity continues to hold when the factor matrices are constrained to be elementwise nonnegative -- a common practical requirement. In the simple setting of a rank-1 nonnegative ground truth, we confirm that benign nonconvexity holds in the fully-observed case with RIP constant $\delta=0$. Surprisingly, however, this property fails to extend to the partially-observed case with any arbitrarily small RIP constant $\delta\to0^{+}$, irrespective of rank overparameterization. This finding exposes a critical theoretical gap: the continuity argument widely used to explain the empirical robustness of low-rank matrix recovery fundamentally breaks down once nonnegative constraints are imposed.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03717v1
Variational Formulation of the Particle Flow Particle Filter,"This paper provides a formulation of the particle flow particle filter from the perspective of variational inference. We show that the transient density used to derive the particle flow particle filter follows a time-scaled trajectory of the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in the space of probability densities. The Fisher-Rao gradient flow is obtained as a continuous-time algorithm for variational inference, minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational density and the true posterior density.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04007v1
A Data-Driven Probabilistic Framework for Cascading Urban Risk Analysis   Using Bayesian Networks,"The increasing complexity of cascading risks in urban systems necessitates robust, data-driven frameworks to model interdependencies across multiple domains. This study presents a foundational Bayesian network-based approach for analyzing cross-domain risk propagation across key urban domains, including air, water, electricity, agriculture, health, infrastructure, weather, and climate. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are constructed using Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs), with structure learning guided by Hill-Climbing search optimized through Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and K2 scoring. The framework is trained on a hybrid dataset that combines real-world urban indicators with synthetically generated data from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and is further balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) derived from the learned structures enable interpretable probabilistic reasoning and quantify the likelihood of cascading failures. The results identify key intra- and inter-domain risk factors and demonstrate the framework's utility for proactive urban resilience planning. This work establishes a scalable, interpretable foundation for cascading risk assessment and serves as a basis for future empirical research in this emerging interdisciplinary field.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06281v1
Improving regional weather forecasts with neural interpolation,"In this paper we design a neural interpolation operator to improve the boundary data for regional weather models, which is a challenging problem as we are required to map multi-scale dynamics between grid resolutions. In particular, we expose a methodology for approaching the problem through the study of a simplified model, with a view to generalise the results in this work to the dynamical core of regional weather models. Our approach will exploit a combination of techniques from image super-resolution with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and residual networks, in addition to building the flow of atmospheric dynamics into the neural network",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12040v1
Unlabeled Data or Pre-trained Model: Rethinking Semi-Supervised Learning   and Pretrain-Finetuning,"Semi-supervised learning (SSL) alleviates the cost of data labeling process by exploiting unlabeled data, and has achieved promising results on various tasks such as image classification. Meanwhile, the Pretrain-Finetuning paradigm has garnered significant attention in recent years, and exploiting pre-trained models could also reduce the requirement of labeled data in downstream tasks. Therefore, a question naturally occurs: \emph{When the labeled data is scarce in the target tasks, should we exploit unlabeled data or pre-trained models?} To answer this question, we select pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as representative pretrain-finetuning instances and propose \textit{Few-shot SSL} -- a framework that enables fair comparison between these two paradigms by controlling the amount of labeled data used. Extensive experiments across various settings demonstrate that pre-trained VLMs generally outperform SSL methods in nearly all cases, except when the data has low resolution or lacks clear semantic structure. Therefore, we encourage future SSL research to compare with pre-trained models and explore deeper integration, such as using pre-trained knowledge to enhance pseudo-labeling. To support future research, we release our unified reproduction and evaluation framework.

Fine-tuning Quantized Neural Networks with Zeroth-order Optimization,"As the size of large language models grows exponentially, GPU memory has become a bottleneck for adapting these models to downstream tasks. In this paper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing memory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a unified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states using zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing weights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize memory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from bfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to quantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete weights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization and re-quantization. To overcome this challenge, we propose Quantized Zeroth-order Optimization (QZO), a novel approach that perturbs the continuous quantization scale for gradient estimation and uses a directional derivative clipping method to stabilize training. QZO is orthogonal to both scalar-based and codebook-based post-training quantization methods. Compared to full-parameter fine-tuning in bfloat16, QZO can reduce the total memory cost by more than 18$\times$ for 4-bit LLMs, and enables fine-tuning Llama-2-13B and Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large within a single 24GB GPU.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13430v1
Learning by solving differential equations,"Modern deep learning algorithms use variations of gradient descent as their main learning methods. Gradient descent can be understood as the simplest Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver; namely, the Euler method applied to the gradient flow differential equation. Since Euler, many ODE solvers have been devised that follow the gradient flow equation more precisely and more stably. Runge-Kutta (RK) methods provide a family of very powerful explicit and implicit high-order ODE solvers. However, these higher-order solvers have not found wide application in deep learning so far. In this work, we evaluate the performance of higher-order RK solvers when applied in deep learning, study their limitations, and propose ways to overcome these drawbacks. In particular, we explore how to improve their performance by naturally incorporating key ingredients of modern neural network optimizers such as preconditioning, adaptive learning rates, and momentum.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13397v1
Cooperative Bayesian and variance networks disentangle aleatoric and   epistemic uncertainties,"Real-world data contains aleatoric uncertainty - irreducible noise arising from imperfect measurements or from incomplete knowledge about the data generation process. Mean variance estimation (MVE) networks can learn this type of uncertainty but require ad-hoc regularization strategies to avoid overfitting and are unable to predict epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty). Conversely, Bayesian neural networks predict epistemic uncertainty but are notoriously difficult to train due to the approximate nature of Bayesian inference. We propose to cooperatively train a variance network with a Bayesian neural network and demonstrate that the resulting model disentangles aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties while improving the mean estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of this method across a diverse range of datasets, including a time-dependent heteroscedastic regression dataset we created where the aleatoric uncertainty is known. The proposed method is straightforward to implement, robust, and adaptable to various model architectures.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02743v1
Variational diffusion transformers for conditional sampling of   supernovae spectra,"Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) have become the most precise distance indicators in astrophysics due to their incredible observational homogeneity. Increasing discovery rates, however, have revealed multiple sub-populations with spectroscopic properties that are both diverse and difficult to interpret using existing physical models. These peculiar events are hard to identify from sparsely sampled observations and can introduce systematics in cosmological analyses if not flagged early; they are also of broader importance for building a cohesive understanding of thermonuclear explosions. In this work, we introduce DiTSNe-Ia, a variational diffusion-based generative model conditioned on light curve observations and trained to reproduce the observed spectral diversity of SNe Ia. In experiments with realistic light curves and spectra from radiative transfer simulations, DiTSNe-Ia achieves significantly more accurate reconstructions than the widely used SALT3 templates across a broad range of observation phases (from 10 days before peak light to 30 days after it). DiTSNe-Ia yields a mean squared error of 0.108 across all phases-five times lower than SALT3's 0.508-and an after-peak error of just 0.0191, an order of magnitude smaller than SALT3's 0.305. Additionally, our model produces well-calibrated credible intervals with near-nominal coverage, particularly at post-peak phases. DiTSNe-Ia is a powerful tool for rapidly inferring the spectral properties of SNe Ia and other transient astrophysical phenomena for which a physical description does not yet exist.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03063v1
A Dataless Reinforcement Learning Approach to Rounding Hyperplane   Optimization for Max-Cut,"The Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problem is NP-Complete, and obtaining its optimal solution is NP-hard in the worst case. As a result, heuristic-based algorithms are commonly used, though their design often requires significant domain expertise. More recently, learning-based methods trained on large (un)labeled datasets have been proposed; however, these approaches often struggle with generalizability and scalability. A well-known approximation algorithm for MaxCut is the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm, which relaxes the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation into a semidefinite program (SDP). The GW algorithm then applies hyperplane rounding by uniformly sampling a random hyperplane to convert the SDP solution into binary node assignments. In this paper, we propose a training-data-free approach based on a non-episodic reinforcement learning formulation, in which an agent learns to select improved rounding hyperplanes that yield better cuts than those produced by the GW algorithm. By optimizing over a Markov Decision Process (MDP), our method consistently achieves better cuts across large-scale graphs with varying densities and degree distributions.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13405v1
Convergence Rates of Constrained Expected Improvement,"Constrained Bayesian optimization (CBO) methods have seen significant success in black-box optimization with constraints, and one of the most commonly used CBO methods is the constrained expected improvement (CEI) algorithm. CEI is a natural extension of the expected improvement (EI) when constraints are incorporated. However, the theoretical convergence rate of CEI has not been established. In this work, we study the convergence rate of CEI by analyzing its simple regret upper bound. First, we show that when the objective function $f$ and constraint function $c$ are assumed to each lie in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), CEI achieves the convergence rates of $\mathcal{O} \left(t^{-\frac{1}{2}}\log^{\frac{d+1}{2}}(t) \right) \ \text{and }\ \mathcal{O}\left(t^{\frac{-\nu}{2\nu+d}} \log^{\frac{\nu}{2\nu+d}}(t)\right)$ for the commonly used squared exponential and Mat\'{e}rn kernels, respectively. Second, we show that when $f$ and $c$ are assumed to be sampled from Gaussian processes (GPs), CEI achieves the same convergence rates with a high probability. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the theoretical analysis.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11323v1
Machine learning the first stage in 2SLS: Practical guidance from bias   decomposition and simulation,"Machine learning (ML) primarily evolved to solve ""prediction problems."" The first stage of two-stage least squares (2SLS) is a prediction problem, suggesting potential gains from ML first-stage assistance. However, little guidance exists on when ML helps 2SLS$\unicode{x2014}$or when it hurts. We investigate the implications of inserting ML into 2SLS, decomposing the bias into three informative components. Mechanically, ML-in-2SLS procedures face issues common to prediction and causal-inference settings$\unicode{x2014}$and their interaction. Through simulation, we show linear ML methods (e.g., post-Lasso) work well, while nonlinear methods (e.g., random forests, neural nets) generate substantial bias in second-stage estimates$\unicode{x2014}$potentially exceeding the bias of endogenous OLS.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13422v1
"FABLE: A Localized, Targeted Adversarial Attack on Weather Forecasting   Models","Deep learning-based weather forecasting models have recently demonstrated significant performance improvements over gold-standard physics-based simulation tools. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which raises concerns about their trustworthiness. In this paper, we first investigate the feasibility of applying existing adversarial attack methods to weather forecasting models. We argue that a successful attack should (1) not modify significantly its original inputs, (2) be faithful, i.e., achieve the desired forecast at targeted locations with minimal changes to non-targeted locations, and (3) be geospatio-temporally realistic. However, balancing these criteria is a challenge as existing methods are not designed to preserve the geospatio-temporal dependencies of the original samples. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called FABLE (Forecast Alteration By Localized targeted advErsarial attack), which employs a 3D discrete wavelet decomposition to extract the varying components of the geospatio-temporal data. By regulating the magnitude of adversarial perturbations across different components, FABLE can generate adversarial inputs that maintain geospatio-temporal coherence while remaining faithful and closely aligned with the original inputs. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework over baseline methods across various metrics.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12167v1
Controlling the Flow: Stability and Convergence for Stochastic Gradient   Descent with Decaying Regularization,"The present article studies the minimization of convex, L-smooth functions defined on a separable real Hilbert space. We analyze regularized stochastic gradient descent (reg-SGD), a variant of stochastic gradient descent that uses a Tikhonov regularization with time-dependent, vanishing regularization parameter. We prove strong convergence of reg-SGD to the minimum-norm solution of the original problem without additional boundedness assumptions. Moreover, we quantify the rate of convergence and optimize the interplay between step-sizes and regularization decay. Our analysis reveals how vanishing Tikhonov regularization controls the flow of SGD and yields stable learning dynamics, offering new insights into the design of iterative algorithms for convex problems, including those that arise in ill-posed inverse problems. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical experiments on image reconstruction and ODE-based inverse problems.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11434v1
Causal View of Time Series Imputation: Some Identification Results on   Missing Mechanism,"Time series imputation is one of the most challenge problems and has broad applications in various fields like health care and the Internet of Things. Existing methods mainly aim to model the temporally latent dependencies and the generation process from the observed time series data. In real-world scenarios, different types of missing mechanisms, like MAR (Missing At Random), and MNAR (Missing Not At Random) can occur in time series data. However, existing methods often overlook the difference among the aforementioned missing mechanisms and use a single model for time series imputation, which can easily lead to misleading results due to mechanism mismatching. In this paper, we propose a framework for time series imputation problem by exploring Different Missing Mechanisms (DMM in short) and tailoring solutions accordingly. Specifically, we first analyze the data generation processes with temporal latent states and missing cause variables for different mechanisms. Sequentially, we model these generation processes via variational inference and estimate prior distributions of latent variables via normalizing flow-based neural architecture. Furthermore, we establish identifiability results under the nonlinear independent component analysis framework to show that latent variables are identifiable. Experimental results show that our method surpasses existing time series imputation techniques across various datasets with different missing mechanisms, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07180v1
Interpretable Robotic Friction Learning via Symbolic Regression,"Accurately modeling the friction torque in robotic joints has long been challenging due to the request for a robust mathematical description. Traditional model-based approaches are often labor-intensive, requiring extensive experiments and expert knowledge, and they are difficult to adapt to new scenarios and dependencies. On the other hand, data-driven methods based on neural networks are easier to implement but often lack robustness, interpretability, and trustworthiness--key considerations for robotic hardware and safety-critical applications such as human-robot interaction. To address the limitations of both approaches, we propose the use of symbolic regression (SR) to estimate the friction torque. SR generates interpretable symbolic formulas similar to those produced by model-based methods while being flexible to accommodate various dynamic effects and dependencies. In this work, we apply SR algorithms to approximate the friction torque using collected data from a KUKA LWR-IV+ robot. Our results show that SR not only yields formulas with comparable complexity to model-based approaches but also achieves higher accuracy. Moreover, SR-derived formulas can be seamlessly extended to include load dependencies and other dynamic factors.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13186v1
neuralGAM: An R Package for Fitting Generalized Additive Neural Networks,"Nowadays, Neural Networks are considered one of the most effective methods for various tasks such as anomaly detection, computer-aided disease detection, or natural language processing. However, these networks suffer from the ``black-box'' problem which makes it difficult to understand how they make decisions. In order to solve this issue, an R package called neuralGAM is introduced. This package implements a Neural Network topology based on Generalized Additive Models, allowing to fit an independent Neural Network to estimate the contribution of each feature to the output variable, yielding a highly accurate and interpretable Deep Learning model. The neuralGAM package provides a flexible framework for training Generalized Additive Neural Networks, which does not impose any restrictions on the Neural Network architecture. We illustrate the use of the neuralGAM package in both synthetic and real data examples.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08610v1
Interpretable Learning Dynamics in Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning,"We present an interpretability framework for unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) agents, aimed at understanding how intrinsic motivation shapes attention, behavior, and representation learning. We analyze five agents DQN, RND, ICM, PPO, and a Transformer-RND variant trained on procedurally generated environments, using Grad-CAM, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), exploration metrics, and latent space clustering. To capture how agents perceive and adapt over time, we introduce two metrics: attention diversity, which measures the spatial breadth of focus, and attention change rate, which quantifies temporal shifts in attention. Our findings show that curiosity-driven agents display broader, more dynamic attention and exploratory behavior than their extrinsically motivated counterparts. Among them, TransformerRND combines wide attention, high exploration coverage, and compact, structured latent representations. Our results highlight the influence of architectural inductive biases and training signals on internal agent dynamics. Beyond reward-centric evaluation, the proposed framework offers diagnostic tools to probe perception and abstraction in RL agents, enabling more interpretable and generalizable behavior.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06279v1
Enhancing Code Quality with Generative AI: Boosting Developer Warning   Compliance,"Programmers have long ignored warnings, especially those generated by static analysis tools, due to the potential for false-positives. In some cases, warnings may be indicative of larger issues, but programmers may not understand how a seemingly unimportant warning can grow into a vulnerability. Because these messages tend to be long and confusing, programmers tend to ignore them if they do not cause readily identifiable issues. Large language models can simplify these warnings, explain the gravity of important warnings, and suggest potential fixes to increase developer compliance with fixing warnings.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11677v1
Learning Guarantee of Reward Modeling Using Deep Neural Networks,"In this work, we study the learning theory of reward modeling with pairwise comparison data using deep neural networks. We establish a novel non-asymptotic regret bound for deep reward estimators in a non-parametric setting, which depends explicitly on the network architecture. Furthermore, to underscore the critical importance of clear human beliefs, we introduce a margin-type condition that assumes the conditional winning probability of the optimal action in pairwise comparisons is significantly distanced from 1/2. This condition enables a sharper regret bound, which substantiates the empirical efficiency of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and highlights clear human beliefs in its success. Notably, this improvement stems from high-quality pairwise comparison data implied by the margin-type condition, is independent of the specific estimators used, and thus applies to various learning algorithms and models.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06601v1
CoCoAFusE: Beyond Mixtures of Experts via Model Fusion,"Many learning problems involve multiple patterns and varying degrees of uncertainty dependent on the covariates. Advances in Deep Learning (DL) have addressed these issues by learning highly nonlinear input-output dependencies. However, model interpretability and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) have often straggled behind. In this context, we introduce the Competitive/Collaborative Fusion of Experts (CoCoAFusE), a novel, Bayesian Covariates-Dependent Modeling technique. CoCoAFusE builds on the very philosophy behind Mixtures of Experts (MoEs), blending predictions from several simple sub-models (or ""experts"") to achieve high levels of expressiveness while retaining a substantial degree of local interpretability. Our formulation extends that of a classical Mixture of Experts by contemplating the fusion of the experts' distributions in addition to their more usual mixing (i.e., superimposition). Through this additional feature, CoCoAFusE better accommodates different scenarios for the intermediate behavior between generating mechanisms, resulting in tighter credible bounds on the response variable. Indeed, only resorting to mixing, as in classical MoEs, may lead to multimodality artifacts, especially over smooth transitions. Instead, CoCoAFusE can avoid these artifacts even under the same structure and priors for the experts, leading to greater expressiveness and flexibility in modeling. This new approach is showcased extensively on a suite of motivating numerical examples and a collection of real-data ones, demonstrating its efficacy in tackling complex regression problems where uncertainty is a key quantity of interest.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01105v1
Wasserstein Barycenter Gaussian Process based Bayesian Optimization,"Gaussian Process based Bayesian Optimization is a widely applied algorithm to learn and optimize under uncertainty, well-known for its sample efficiency. However, recently -- and more frequently -- research studies have empirically demonstrated that the Gaussian Process fitting procedure at its core could be its most relevant weakness. Fitting a Gaussian Process means tuning its kernel's hyperparameters to a set of observations, but the common Maximum Likelihood Estimation technique, usually appropriate for learning tasks, has shown different criticalities in Bayesian Optimization, making theoretical analysis of this algorithm an open challenge. Exploiting the analogy between Gaussian Processes and Gaussian Distributions, we present a new approach which uses a prefixed set of hyperparameters values to fit as many Gaussian Processes and then combines them into a unique model as a Wasserstein Barycenter of Gaussian Processes. We considered both ""easy"" test problems and others known to undermine the \textit{vanilla} Bayesian Optimization algorithm. The new method, namely Wasserstein Barycenter Gausssian Process based Bayesian Optimization (WBGP-BO), resulted promising and able to converge to the optimum, contrary to vanilla Bayesian Optimization, also on the most ""tricky"" test problems.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12471v1
Do different prompting methods yield a common task representation in   language models?,"Demonstrations and instructions are two primary approaches for prompting language models to perform in-context learning (ICL) tasks. Do identical tasks elicited in different ways result in similar representations of the task? An improved understanding of task representation mechanisms would offer interpretability insights and may aid in steering models. We study this through function vectors, recently proposed as a mechanism to extract few-shot ICL task representations. We generalize function vectors to alternative task presentations, focusing on short textual instruction prompts, and successfully extract instruction function vectors that promote zero-shot task accuracy. We find evidence that demonstration- and instruction-based function vectors leverage different model components, and offer several controls to dissociate their contributions to task performance. Our results suggest that different task presentations do not induce a common task representation but elicit different, partly overlapping mechanisms. Our findings offer principled support to the practice of combining textual instructions and task demonstrations, imply challenges in universally monitoring task inference across presentation forms, and encourage further examinations of LLM task inference mechanisms.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12075v1
Unlocking Non-Invasive Brain-to-Text,"Despite major advances in surgical brain-to-text (B2T), i.e. transcribing speech from invasive brain recordings, non-invasive alternatives have yet to surpass even chance on standard metrics. This remains a barrier to building a non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) capable of restoring communication in paralysed individuals without surgery. Here, we present the first non-invasive B2T result that significantly exceeds these critical baselines, raising BLEU by $1.4\mathrm{-}2.6\times$ over prior work. This result is driven by three contributions: (1) we extend recent word-classification models with LLM-based rescoring, transforming single-word predictors into closed-vocabulary B2T systems; (2) we introduce a predictive in-filling approach to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, substantially expanding the effective vocabulary; and (3) we demonstrate, for the first time, how to scale non-invasive B2T models across datasets, unlocking deep learning at scale and improving accuracy by $2.1\mathrm{-}2.3\times$. Through these contributions, we offer new insights into the roles of data quality and vocabulary size. Together, our results remove a major obstacle to realising practical non-invasive B2T systems.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13446v1
On DeepSeekMoE: Statistical Benefits of Shared Experts and Normalized   Sigmoid Gating,"Mixture of experts (MoE) methods are a key component in most large language model architectures, including the recent series of DeepSeek models. Compared to other MoE implementations, DeepSeekMoE stands out because of two unique features: the deployment of a shared expert strategy and of the normalized sigmoid gating mechanism. Despite the prominent role of DeepSeekMoE in the success of the DeepSeek series of models, there have been only a few attempts to justify theoretically the value of the shared expert strategy, while its normalized sigmoid gating has remained unexplored. To bridge this gap, we undertake a comprehensive theoretical study of these two features of DeepSeekMoE from a statistical perspective. We perform a convergence analysis of the expert estimation task to highlight the gains in sample efficiency for both the shared expert strategy and the normalized sigmoid gating, offering useful insights into the design of expert and gating structures. To verify empirically our theoretical findings, we carry out several experiments on both synthetic data and real-world datasets for (vision) language modeling tasks. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis of the router behaviors, ranging from router saturation, router change rate, to expert utilization.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10860v1
DISCO: learning to DISCover an evolution Operator for   multi-physics-agnostic prediction,"We address the problem of predicting the next state of a dynamical system governed by unknown temporal partial differential equations (PDEs) using only a short trajectory. While standard transformers provide a natural black-box solution to this task, the presence of a well-structured evolution operator in the data suggests a more tailored and efficient approach. Specifically, when the PDE is fully known, classical numerical solvers can evolve the state accurately with only a few parameters. Building on this observation, we introduce DISCO, a model that uses a large hypernetwork to process a short trajectory and generate the parameters of a much smaller operator network, which then predicts the next state through time integration. Our framework decouples dynamics estimation (i.e., DISCovering an evolution operator from a short trajectory) from state prediction (i.e., evolving this operator). Experiments show that pretraining our model on diverse physics datasets achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring significantly fewer epochs. Moreover, it generalizes well and remains competitive when fine-tuned on downstream tasks.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19496v1
FedDuA: Doubly Adaptive Federated Learning,"Federated learning is a distributed learning framework where clients collaboratively train a global model without sharing their raw data. FedAvg is a popular algorithm for federated learning, but it often suffers from slow convergence due to the heterogeneity of local datasets and anisotropy in the parameter space. In this work, we formalize the central server optimization procedure through the lens of mirror descent and propose a novel framework, called FedDuA, which adaptively selects the global learning rate based on both inter-client and coordinate-wise heterogeneity in the local updates. We prove that our proposed doubly adaptive step-size rule is minimax optimal and provide a convergence analysis for convex objectives. Although the proposed method does not require additional communication or computational cost on clients, extensive numerical experiments show that our proposed framework outperforms baselines in various settings and is robust to the choice of hyperparameters.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11126v1
Learning High-dimensional Gaussians from Censored Data,"We provide efficient algorithms for the problem of distribution learning from high-dimensional Gaussian data where in each sample, some of the variable values are missing. We suppose that the variables are missing not at random (MNAR). The missingness model, denoted by $S(y)$, is the function that maps any point $y$ in $R^d$ to the subsets of its coordinates that are seen. In this work, we assume that it is known. We study the following two settings:   (i) Self-censoring: An observation $x$ is generated by first sampling the true value $y$ from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian $N(\mu*, \Sigma*)$ with unknown $\mu*$ and $\Sigma*$. For each coordinate $i$, there exists a set $S_i$ subseteq $R^d$ such that $x_i = y_i$ if and only if $y_i$ in $S_i$. Otherwise, $x_i$ is missing and takes a generic value (e.g., ""?""). We design an algorithm that learns $N(\mu*, \Sigma*)$ up to total variation (TV) distance epsilon, using $poly(d, 1/\epsilon)$ samples, assuming only that each pair of coordinates is observed with sufficiently high probability.   (ii) Linear thresholding: An observation $x$ is generated by first sampling $y$ from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian $N(\mu*, \Sigma)$ with unknown $\mu*$ and known $\Sigma$, and then applying the missingness model $S$ where $S(y) = {i in [d] : v_i^T y <= b_i}$ for some $v_1, ..., v_d$ in $R^d$ and $b_1, ..., b_d$ in $R$. We design an efficient mean estimation algorithm, assuming that none of the possible missingness patterns is very rare conditioned on the values of the observed coordinates and that any small subset of coordinates is observed with sufficiently high probability.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19446v1
Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Nonparametric Regression,"Distributionally robust optimization has become a powerful tool for prediction and decision-making under model uncertainty. By focusing on the local worst-case risk, it enhances robustness by identifying the most unfavorable distribution within a predefined ambiguity set. While extensive research has been conducted in parametric settings, studies on nonparametric frameworks remain limited. This paper studies the generalization properties of Wasserstein distributionally robust nonparametric estimators, with particular attention to the impact of model misspecification, where non-negligible discrepancies between the estimation function space and target function can impair generalization performance. We establish non-asymptotic error bounds for the excess local worst-case risk by analyzing the regularization effects induced by distributional perturbations and employing feedforward neural networks with Lipschitz constraints. These bounds illustrate how uncertainty levels and neural network structures influence generalization performance and are applicable to both Lipschitz and quadratic loss functions. Furthermore, we investigate the Lagrangian relaxation of the local worst-case risk and derive corresponding non-asymptotic error bounds for these estimators. The robustness of the proposed estimator is evaluated through simulation studies and illustrated with an application to the MNIST dataset.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07967v1
NeuralSurv: Deep Survival Analysis with Bayesian Uncertainty   Quantification,"We introduce NeuralSurv, the first deep survival model to incorporate Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our non-parametric, architecture-agnostic framework flexibly captures time-varying covariate-risk relationships in continuous time via a novel two-stage data-augmentation scheme, for which we establish theoretical guarantees. For efficient posterior inference, we introduce a mean-field variational algorithm with coordinate-ascent updates that scale linearly in model size. By locally linearizing the Bayesian neural network, we obtain full conjugacy and derive all coordinate updates in closed form. In experiments, NeuralSurv delivers superior calibration compared to state-of-the-art deep survival models, while matching or exceeding their discriminative performance across both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate the value of Bayesian principles in data-scarce regimes by enhancing model calibration and providing robust, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for the survival function.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11054v1
A comparison of generative deep learning methods for multivariate   angular simulation,"With the recent development of new geometric and angular-radial frameworks for multivariate extremes, reliably simulating from angular variables in moderate-to-high dimensions is of increasing importance. Empirical approaches have the benefit of simplicity, and work reasonably well in low dimensions, but as the number of variables increases, they can lack the required flexibility and scalability. Classical parametric models for angular variables, such as the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, provide an alternative. Exploiting mixtures of vMF distributions increases their flexibility, but there are cases where even this is not sufficient to capture the intricate features that can arise in data. Owing to their flexibility, generative deep learning methods are able to capture complex data structures; they therefore have the potential to be useful in the simulation of angular variables. In this paper, we explore a range of deep learning approaches for this task, including generative adversarial networks, normalizing flows and flow matching. We assess their performance via a range of metrics and make comparisons to the more classical approach of using a mixture of vMF distributions. The methods are also applied to a metocean data set, demonstrating their applicability to real-world, complex data structures.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21505v1
Stabilizing Temporal Difference Learning via Implicit Stochastic   Approximation,"Temporal Difference (TD) learning is a foundational algorithm in reinforcement learning (RL). For nearly forty years, TD learning has served as a workhorse for applied RL as well as a building block for more complex and specialized algorithms. However, despite its widespread use, it is not without drawbacks, the most prominent being its sensitivity to step size. A poor choice of step size can dramatically inflate the error of value estimates and slow convergence. Consequently, in practice, researchers must use trial and error in order to identify a suitable step size -- a process that can be tedious and time consuming. As an alternative, we propose implicit TD algorithms that reformulate TD updates into fixed-point equations. These updates are more stable and less sensitive to step size without sacrificing computational efficiency. Moreover, our theoretical analysis establishes asymptotic convergence guarantees and finite-time error bounds. Our results demonstrate their robustness and practicality for modern RL tasks, establishing implicit TD as a versatile tool for policy evaluation and value approximation.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01361v1
From Low Field to High Value: Robust Cortical Mapping from Low-Field MRI,"Three-dimensional reconstruction of cortical surfaces from MRI for morphometric analysis is fundamental for understanding brain structure. While high-field MRI (HF-MRI) is standard in research and clinical settings, its limited availability hinders widespread use. Low-field MRI (LF-MRI), particularly portable systems, offers a cost-effective and accessible alternative. However, existing cortical surface analysis tools are optimized for high-resolution HF-MRI and struggle with the lower signal-to-noise ratio and resolution of LF-MRI. In this work, we present a machine learning method for 3D reconstruction and analysis of portable LF-MRI across a range of contrasts and resolutions. Our method works ""out of the box"" without retraining. It uses a 3D U-Net trained on synthetic LF-MRI to predict signed distance functions of cortical surfaces, followed by geometric processing to ensure topological accuracy. We evaluate our method using paired HF/LF-MRI scans of the same subjects, showing that LF-MRI surface reconstruction accuracy depends on acquisition parameters, including contrast type (T1 vs T2), orientation (axial vs isotropic), and resolution. A 3mm isotropic T2-weighted scan acquired in under 4 minutes, yields strong agreement with HF-derived surfaces: surface area correlates at r=0.96, cortical parcellations reach Dice=0.98, and gray matter volume achieves r=0.93. Cortical thickness remains more challenging with correlations up to r=0.70, reflecting the difficulty of sub-mm precision with 3mm voxels. We further validate our method on challenging postmortem LF-MRI, demonstrating its robustness. Our method represents a step toward enabling cortical surface analysis on portable LF-MRI.

A note on concentration inequalities for the overlapped batch mean   variance estimators for Markov chains,"In this paper, we study the concentration properties of quadratic forms associated with Markov chains using the martingale decomposition method introduced by Atchad\'e and Cattaneo (2014). In particular, we derive concentration inequalities for the overlapped batch mean (OBM) estimators of the asymptotic variance for uniformly geometrically ergodic Markov chains. Our main result provides an explicit control of the $p$-th moment of the difference between the OBM estimator and the asymptotic variance of the Markov chain with explicit dependence upon $p$ and mixing time of the underlying Markov chain.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08456v1
Preference Isolation Forest for Structure-based Anomaly Detection,"We address the problem of detecting anomalies as samples that do not conform to structured patterns represented by low-dimensional manifolds. To this end, we conceive a general anomaly detection framework called Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), that combines the benefits of adaptive isolation-based methods with the flexibility of preference embedding. The key intuition is to embed the data into a high-dimensional preference space by fitting low-dimensional manifolds, and to identify anomalies as isolated points. We propose three isolation approaches to identify anomalies: $i$) Voronoi-iForest, the most general solution, $ii$) RuzHash-iForest, that avoids explicit computation of distances via Local Sensitive Hashing, and $iii$) Sliding-PIF, that leverages a locality prior to improve efficiency and effectiveness.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10876v1
PCS-UQ: Uncertainty Quantification via the   Predictability-Computability-Stability Framework,"As machine learning (ML) models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, trustworthy uncertainty quantification (UQ) is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of these models. Traditional UQ methods rely on specifying a true generative model and are not robust to misspecification. On the other hand, conformal inference allows for arbitrary ML models but does not consider model selection, which leads to large interval sizes. We tackle these drawbacks by proposing a UQ method based on the predictability, computability, and stability (PCS) framework for veridical data science proposed by Yu and Kumbier. Specifically, PCS-UQ addresses model selection by using a prediction check to screen out unsuitable models. PCS-UQ then fits these screened algorithms across multiple bootstraps to assess inter-sample variability and algorithmic instability, enabling more reliable uncertainty estimates. Further, we propose a novel calibration scheme that improves local adaptivity of our prediction sets. Experiments across $17$ regression and $6$ classification datasets show that PCS-UQ achieves the desired coverage and reduces width over conformal approaches by $\approx 20\%$. Further, our local analysis shows PCS-UQ often achieves target coverage across subgroups while conformal methods fail to do so. For large deep-learning models, we propose computationally efficient approximation schemes that avoid the expensive multiple bootstrap trainings of PCS-UQ. Across three computer vision benchmarks, PCS-UQ reduces prediction set size over conformal methods by $20\%$. Theoretically, we show a modified PCS-UQ algorithm is a form of split conformal inference and achieves the desired coverage with exchangeable data.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08784v1
The Stochastic Occupation Kernel (SOCK) Method for Learning Stochastic   Differential Equations,"We present a novel kernel-based method for learning multivariate stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The method follows a two-step procedure: we first estimate the drift term function, then the (matrix-valued) diffusion function given the drift. Occupation kernels are integral functionals on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that aggregate information over a trajectory. Our approach leverages vector-valued occupation kernels for estimating the drift component of the stochastic process. For diffusion estimation, we extend this framework by introducing operator-valued occupation kernels, enabling the estimation of an auxiliary matrix-valued function as a positive semi-definite operator, from which we readily derive the diffusion estimate. This enables us to avoid common challenges in SDE learning, such as intractable likelihoods, by optimizing a reconstruction-error-based objective. We propose a simple learning procedure that retains strong predictive accuracy while using Fenchel duality to promote efficiency. We validate the method on simulated benchmarks and a real-world dataset of Amyloid imaging in healthy and Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11622v1
Action-Dependent Optimality-Preserving Reward Shaping,"Recent RL research has utilized reward shaping--particularly complex shaping rewards such as intrinsic motivation (IM)--to encourage agent exploration in sparse-reward environments. While often effective, ``reward hacking'' can lead to the shaping reward being optimized at the expense of the extrinsic reward, resulting in a suboptimal policy. Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) techniques such as Generalized Reward Matching (GRM) and Policy-Invariant Explicit Shaping (PIES) have mitigated this. These methods allow for implementing IM without altering optimal policies. In this work we show that they are effectively unsuitable for complex, exploration-heavy environments with long-duration episodes. To remedy this, we introduce Action-Dependent Optimality Preserving Shaping (ADOPS), a method of converting intrinsic rewards to an optimality-preserving form that allows agents to utilize IM more effectively in the extremely sparse environment of Montezuma's Revenge. We also prove ADOPS accommodates reward shaping functions that cannot be written in a potential-based form: while PBRS-based methods require the cumulative discounted intrinsic return be independent of actions, ADOPS allows for intrinsic cumulative returns to be dependent on agents' actions while still preserving the optimal policy set. We show how action-dependence enables ADOPS's to preserve optimality while learning in complex, sparse-reward environments where other methods struggle.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12611v1
Dementia Through Different Eyes: Explainable Modeling of Human and LLM   Perceptions for Early Awareness,"Cognitive decline often surfaces in language years before diagnosis. It is frequently non-experts, such as those closest to the patient, who first sense a change and raise concern. As LLMs become integrated into daily communication and used over prolonged periods, it may even be an LLM that notices something is off. But what exactly do they notice--and should be noticing--when making that judgment? This paper investigates how dementia is perceived through language by non-experts. We presented transcribed picture descriptions to non-expert humans and LLMs, asking them to intuitively judge whether each text was produced by someone healthy or with dementia. We introduce an explainable method that uses LLMs to extract high-level, expert-guided features representing these picture descriptions, and use logistic regression to model human and LLM perceptions and compare with clinical diagnoses. Our analysis reveals that human perception of dementia is inconsistent and relies on a narrow, and sometimes misleading, set of cues. LLMs, by contrast, draw on a richer, more nuanced feature set that aligns more closely with clinical patterns. Still, both groups show a tendency toward false negatives, frequently overlooking dementia cases. Through our interpretable framework and the insights it provides, we hope to help non-experts better recognize the linguistic signs that matter.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13418v1
The Double Descent Behavior in Two Layer Neural Network for Binary   Classification,"Recent studies observed a surprising concept on model test error called the double descent phenomenon, where the increasing model complexity decreases the test error first and then the error increases and decreases again. To observe this, we work on a two layer neural network model with a ReLU activation function designed for binary classification under supervised learning. Our aim is to observe and investigate the mathematical theory behind the double descent behavior of model test error for varying model sizes. We quantify the model size by the ratio of number of training samples to the dimension of the model. Due to the complexity of the empirical risk minimization procedure, we use the Convex Gaussian Min Max Theorem to find a suitable candidate for the global training loss.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19351v1
Gluon: Making Muon & Scion Great Again! (Bridging Theory and Practice of   LMO-based Optimizers for LLMs),"Recent developments in deep learning optimization have brought about radically new algorithms based on the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) framework, such as $\sf Muon$ and $\sf Scion$. After over a decade of $\sf Adam$'s dominance, these LMO-based methods are emerging as viable replacements, offering several practical advantages such as improved memory efficiency, better hyperparameter transferability, and most importantly, superior empirical performance on large-scale tasks, including LLM training. However, a significant gap remains between their practical use and our current theoretical understanding: prior analyses (1) overlook the layer-wise LMO application of these optimizers in practice, and (2) rely on an unrealistic smoothness assumption, leading to impractically small stepsizes. To address both, we propose a new LMO-based method called $\sf Gluon$, capturing prior theoretically analyzed methods as special cases, and introduce a new refined generalized smoothness model that captures the layer-wise geometry of neural networks, matches the layer-wise practical implementation of $\sf Muon$ and $\sf Scion$, and leads to convergence guarantees with strong practical predictive power. Unlike prior results, our theoretical stepsizes closely match the fine-tuned values reported by Pethick et al. (2025). Our experiments with NanoGPT and CNN confirm that our assumption holds along the optimization trajectory, ultimately closing the gap between theory and practice.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13416v1
Direct Density Ratio Optimization: A Statistically Consistent Approach   to Aligning Large Language Models,"Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for safe deployment, yet existing methods assume specific preference models like Bradley-Terry model. This assumption leads to statistical inconsistency, where more data doesn't guarantee convergence to true human preferences. To address this critical gap, we introduce a novel alignment method Direct Density Ratio Optimization (DDRO). DDRO directly estimates the density ratio between preferred and unpreferred output distributions, circumventing the need for explicit human preference modeling. We theoretically prove that DDRO is statistically consistent, ensuring convergence to the true preferred distribution as the data size grows, regardless of the underlying preference structure. Experiments demonstrate that DDRO achieves superior performance compared to existing methods on many major benchmarks. DDRO unlocks the potential for truly data-driven alignment, paving the way for more reliable and human-aligned LLMs.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07558v1
Online Isolation Forest,"The anomaly detection literature is abundant with offline methods, which require repeated access to data in memory, and impose impractical assumptions when applied to a streaming context. Existing online anomaly detection methods also generally fail to address these constraints, resorting to periodic retraining to adapt to the online context. We propose Online-iForest, a novel method explicitly designed for streaming conditions that seamlessly tracks the data generating process as it evolves over time. Experimental validation on real-world datasets demonstrated that Online-iForest is on par with online alternatives and closely rivals state-of-the-art offline anomaly detection techniques that undergo periodic retraining. Notably, Online-iForest consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency, making it a promising solution in applications where fast identification of anomalies is of primary importance such as cybersecurity, fraud and fault detection.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09593v1
Trajectory Entropy Reinforcement Learning for Predictable and Robust   Control,"Simplicity is a critical inductive bias for designing data-driven controllers, especially when robustness is important. Despite the impressive results of deep reinforcement learning in complex control tasks, it is prone to capturing intricate and spurious correlations between observations and actions, leading to failure under slight perturbations to the environment. To tackle this problem, in this work we introduce a novel inductive bias towards simple policies in reinforcement learning. The simplicity inductive bias is introduced by minimizing the entropy of entire action trajectories, corresponding to the number of bits required to describe information in action trajectories after the agent observes state trajectories. Our reinforcement learning agent, Trajectory Entropy Reinforcement Learning, is optimized to minimize the trajectory entropy while maximizing rewards. We show that the trajectory entropy can be effectively estimated by learning a variational parameterized action prediction model, and use the prediction model to construct an information-regularized reward function. Furthermore, we construct a practical algorithm that enables the joint optimization of models, including the policy and the prediction model. Experimental evaluations on several high-dimensional locomotion tasks show that our learned policies produce more cyclical and consistent action trajectories, and achieve superior performance, and robustness to noise and dynamic changes than the state-of-the-art.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04193v1
COMRECGC: Global Graph Counterfactual Explainer through Common Recourse,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in various domains such as social networks, molecular biology, or recommendation systems. Concurrently, different explanations methods of GNNs have arisen to complement its black-box nature. Explanations of the GNNs' predictions can be categorized into two types--factual and counterfactual. Given a GNN trained on binary classification into ''accept'' and ''reject'' classes, a global counterfactual explanation consists in generating a small set of ''accept'' graphs relevant to all of the input ''reject'' graphs. The transformation of a ''reject'' graph into an ''accept'' graph is called a recourse. A common recourse explanation is a small set of recourse, from which every ''reject'' graph can be turned into an ''accept'' graph. Although local counterfactual explanations have been studied extensively, the problem of finding common recourse for global counterfactual explanation remains unexplored, particularly for GNNs. In this paper, we formalize the common recourse explanation problem, and design an effective algorithm, COMRECGC, to solve it. We benchmark our algorithm against strong baselines on four different real-world graphs datasets and demonstrate the superior performance of COMRECGC against the competitors. We also compare the common recourse explanations to the graph counterfactual explanation, showing that common recourse explanations are either comparable or superior, making them worth considering for applications such as drug discovery or computational biology.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07081v2
Utilising Gradient-Based Proposals Within Sequential Monte Carlo   Samplers for Training of Partial Bayesian Neural Networks,"Partial Bayesian neural networks (pBNNs) have been shown to perform competitively with fully Bayesian neural networks while only having a subset of the parameters be stochastic. Using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers as the inference method for pBNNs gives a non-parametric probabilistic estimation of the stochastic parameters, and has shown improved performance over parametric methods. In this paper we introduce a new SMC-based training method for pBNNs by utilising a guided proposal and incorporating gradient-based Markov kernels, which gives us better scalability on high dimensional problems. We show that our new method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of predictive performance and optimal loss. We also show that pBNNs scale well with larger batch sizes, resulting in significantly reduced training times and often better performance.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03797v1
Inference for max-linear Bayesian networks with noise,"Max-Linear Bayesian Networks (MLBNs) provide a powerful framework for causal inference in extreme-value settings; we consider MLBNs with noise parameters with a given topology in terms of the max-plus algebra by taking its logarithm. Then, we show that an estimator of a parameter for each edge in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is distributed normally. We end this paper with computational experiments with the expectation and maximization (EM) algorithm and quadratic optimization.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00229v1
A Case for Library-Level k-Means Binning in Histogram Gradient-Boosted   Trees,"Modern gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) accelerate split finding with histogram-based binning, which reduces complexity from O(N) to O(B) given a fixed bin budget B. However, the predominant quantile binning strategy-designed to distribute data points evenly among bins-may overlook critical boundary values that could enhance predictive performance. In this work, we propose replacing quantile binning with a k-means discretizer initialized with quantile bins. We test this swap on 33 OpenML tasks plus synthetics that control for modality, skew, and bin budget. Across 18 regression datasets, k-means shows no statistically significant losses at the 5% level and wins in four cases-most strikingly a 55% MSE drop on one particularly skewed dataset-even though k-means' mean reciprocal rank (MRR) is slightly lower (0.65 vs 0.72). On the 15 classification datasets the two methods are statistically tied (MRR 0.70 vs 0.68) with gaps $\leq$0.2 pp. Synthetic experiments confirm consistently large MSE gains-typically >20% and rising to 90% as outlier magnitude increases or bin budget drops. We find that k-means keeps error on par with exact splitting when extra cuts add little value, yet still recovers key split points that quantile overlooks. As such, we advocate for a built-in bin_method=k-means flag, especially in regression tasks and in tight-budget settings such as the 32-64-bin GPU regime-because it is a ""safe default"" with large upside, yet adds only a one-off, cacheable overhead ($\approx$ 2s to bin 10M rows on one core).",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12460v1
Deep Unfolding with Kernel-based Quantization in MIMO Detection,"The development of edge computing places critical demands on energy-efficient model deployment for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection tasks. Deploying deep unfolding models such as PGD-Nets and ADMM-Nets into resource-constrained edge devices using quantization methods is challenging. Existing quantization methods based on quantization aware training (QAT) suffer from performance degradation due to their reliance on parametric distribution assumption of activations and static quantization step sizes. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel kernel-based adaptive quantization (KAQ) framework for deep unfolding networks. By utilizing a joint kernel density estimation (KDE) and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) approach to align activation distributions between full-precision and quantized models, the need for prior distribution assumptions is eliminated. Additionally, a dynamic step size updating method is introduced to adjust the quantization step size based on the channel conditions of wireless networks. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the accuracy of proposed KAQ framework outperforms traditional methods and successfully reduces the model's inference latency.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12736v1
GenZSL: Generative Zero-Shot Learning Via Inductive Variational   Autoencoder,"Remarkable progress in zero-shot learning (ZSL) has been achieved using generative models. However, existing generative ZSL methods merely generate (imagine) the visual features from scratch guided by the strong class semantic vectors annotated by experts, resulting in suboptimal generative performance and limited scene generalization. To address these and advance ZSL, we propose an inductive variational autoencoder for generative zero-shot learning, dubbed GenZSL. Mimicking human-level concept learning, GenZSL operates by inducting new class samples from similar seen classes using weak class semantic vectors derived from target class names (i.e., CLIP text embedding). To ensure the generation of informative samples for training an effective ZSL classifier, our GenZSL incorporates two key strategies. Firstly, it employs class diversity promotion to enhance the diversity of class semantic vectors. Secondly, it utilizes target class-guided information boosting criteria to optimize the model. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmark datasets showcase the superiority and potential of our GenZSL with significant efficacy and efficiency over f-VAEGAN, e.g., 24.7% performance gains and more than $60\times$ faster training speed on AWA2. Codes are available at https://github.com/shiming-chen/GenZSL.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11882v1
Risk Bounds For Distributional Regression,"This work examines risk bounds for nonparametric distributional regression estimators. For convex-constrained distributional regression, general upper bounds are established for the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) and the worst-case mean squared error (MSE) across the domain. These theoretical results are applied to isotonic and trend filtering distributional regression, yielding convergence rates consistent with those for mean estimation. Furthermore, a general upper bound is derived for distributional regression under non-convex constraints, with a specific application to neural network-based estimators. Comprehensive experiments on both simulated and real data validate the theoretical contributions, demonstrating their practical effectiveness.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09075v1
Online Feedback Efficient Active Target Discovery in Partially   Observable Environments,"In various scientific and engineering domains, where data acquisition is costly, such as in medical imaging, environmental monitoring, or remote sensing, strategic sampling from unobserved regions, guided by prior observations, is essential to maximize target discovery within a limited sampling budget. In this work, we introduce Diffusion-guided Active Target Discovery (DiffATD), a novel method that leverages diffusion dynamics for active target discovery. DiffATD maintains a belief distribution over each unobserved state in the environment, using this distribution to dynamically balance exploration-exploitation. Exploration reduces uncertainty by sampling regions with the highest expected entropy, while exploitation targets areas with the highest likelihood of discovering the target, indicated by the belief distribution and an incrementally trained reward model designed to learn the characteristics of the target. DiffATD enables efficient target discovery in a partially observable environment within a fixed sampling budget, all without relying on any prior supervised training. Furthermore, DiffATD offers interpretability, unlike existing black-box policies that require extensive supervised training. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies across diverse domains, including medical imaging and remote sensing, we show that DiffATD performs significantly better than baselines and competitively with supervised methods that operate under full environmental observability.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06535v1
Fast RoPE Attention: Combining the Polynomial Method and Fast Fourier   Transform,"The transformer architecture has been widely applied to many machine learning tasks. A main bottleneck in the time to perform transformer computations is a task called attention computation. [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023] have shown that in the bounded entry regime, there is an almost linear time algorithm to approximate the attention computation. They also proved that the bounded entry assumption is necessary for a fast algorithm assuming the popular Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis.   A new version of transformer which uses position embeddings has recently been very successful. At a high level, position embedding enables the model to capture the correlations between tokens while taking into account their position in the sequence. Perhaps the most popular and effective version is Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which was proposed by [Su, Lu, Pan, Murtadha, Wen, and Liu, Neurocomputing 2024].   A main downside of RoPE is that it complicates the attention computation problem, so that previous techniques for designing almost linear time algorithms no longer seem to work. In this paper, we show how to overcome this issue, and give a new algorithm to compute the RoPE attention in almost linear time in the bounded entry regime. (Again, known lower bounds imply that bounded entries are necessary.) Our new algorithm combines two techniques in a novel way: the polynomial method, which was used in prior fast attention algorithms, and the Fast Fourier Transform.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11892v1
Weighted Random Dot Product Graphs,"Modeling of intricate relational patterns has become a cornerstone of contemporary statistical research and related data science fields. Networks, represented as graphs, offer a natural framework for this analysis. This paper extends the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG) model to accommodate weighted graphs, markedly broadening the model's scope to scenarios where edges exhibit heterogeneous weight distributions. We propose a nonparametric weighted (W)RDPG model that assigns a sequence of latent positions to each node. Inner products of these nodal vectors specify the moments of their incident edge weights' distribution via moment-generating functions. In this way, and unlike prior art, the WRDPG can discriminate between weight distributions that share the same mean but differ in other higher-order moments. We derive statistical guarantees for an estimator of the nodal's latent positions adapted from the workhorse adjacency spectral embedding, establishing its consistency and asymptotic normality. We also contribute a generative framework that enables sampling of graphs that adhere to a (prescribed or data-fitted) WRDPG, facilitating, e.g., the analysis and testing of observed graph metrics using judicious reference distributions. The paper is organized to formalize the model's definition, the estimation (or nodal embedding) process and its guarantees, as well as the methodologies for generating weighted graphs, all complemented by illustrative and reproducible examples showcasing the WRDPG's effectiveness in various network analytic applications.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03649v2
Alternators With Noise Models,"Alternators have recently been introduced as a framework for modeling time-dependent data. They often outperform other popular frameworks, such as state-space models and diffusion models, on challenging time-series tasks. This paper introduces a new Alternator model, called Alternator++, which enhances the flexibility of traditional Alternators by explicitly modeling the noise terms used to sample the latent and observed trajectories, drawing on the idea of noise models from the diffusion modeling literature. Alternator++ optimizes the sum of the Alternator loss and a noise-matching loss. The latter forces the noise trajectories generated by the two noise models to approximate the noise trajectories that produce the observed and latent trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Alternator++ in tasks such as density estimation, time series imputation, and forecasting, showing that it outperforms several strong baselines, including Mambas, ScoreGrad, and Dyffusion.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12544v1
Power Allocation for Delay Optimization in Device-to-Device Networks: A   Graph Reinforcement Learning Approach,"The pursuit of rate maximization in wireless communication frequently encounters substantial challenges associated with user fairness. This paper addresses these challenges by exploring a novel power allocation approach for delay optimization, utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs)-based reinforcement learning (RL) in device-to-device (D2D) communication. The proposed approach incorporates not only channel state information but also factors such as packet delay, the number of backlogged packets, and the number of transmitted packets into the components of the state information. We adopt a centralized RL method, where a central controller collects and processes the state information. The central controller functions as an agent trained using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. To better utilize topology information in the communication network and enhance the generalization of the proposed method, we embed GNN layers into both the actor and critic networks of the PPO algorithm. This integration allows for efficient parameter updates of GNNs and enables the state information to be parameterized as a low-dimensional embedding, which is leveraged by the agent to optimize power allocation strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces average delay while ensuring user fairness, outperforms baseline methods, and exhibits scalability and generalization capability.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12902v1
Universal Semantic Disentangled Privacy-preserving Speech Representation   Learning,"The use of audio recordings of human speech to train LLMs poses privacy concerns due to these models' potential to generate outputs that closely resemble artifacts in the training data. In this study, we propose a speaker privacy-preserving representation learning method through the Universal Speech Codec (USC), a computationally efficient encoder-decoder model that disentangles speech into: $\textit{(i)}$ privacy-preserving semantically rich representations, capturing content and speech paralinguistics, and $\textit{(ii)}$ residual acoustic and speaker representations that enables high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive evaluations presented show that USC's semantic representation preserves content, prosody, and sentiment, while removing potentially identifiable speaker attributes. Combining both representations, USC achieves state-of-the-art speech reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation methodology for measuring privacy-preserving properties, aligning with perceptual tests. We compare USC against other codecs in the literature and demonstrate its effectiveness on privacy-preserving representation learning, illustrating the trade-offs of speaker anonymization, paralinguistics retention and content preservation in the learned semantic representations. Audio samples are shared in $\href{https://www.amazon.science/usc-samples}{https://www.amazon.science/usc-samples}$.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13085v1
"Bridging the Reality Gap in Digital Twins with Context-Aware,   Physics-Guided Deep Learning","Digital twins (DTs) enable powerful predictive analytics, but persistent discrepancies between simulations and real systems--known as the reality gap--undermine their reliability. Coined in robotics, the term now applies to DTs, where discrepancies stem from context mismatches, cross-domain interactions, and multi-scale dynamics. Among these, context mismatch is pressing and underexplored, as DT accuracy depends on capturing operational context, often only partially observable. However, DTs have a key advantage: simulators can systematically vary contextual factors and explore scenarios difficult or impossible to observe empirically, informing inference and model alignment. While sim-to-real transfer like domain adaptation shows promise in robotics, their application to DTs poses two key challenges. First, unlike one-time policy transfers, DTs require continuous calibration across an asset's lifecycle--demanding structured information flow, timely detection of out-of-sync states, and integration of historical and new data. Second, DTs often perform inverse modeling, inferring latent states or faults from observations that may reflect multiple evolving contexts. These needs strain purely data-driven models and risk violating physical consistency. Though some approaches preserve validity via reduced-order model, most domain adaptation techniques still lack such constraints. To address this, we propose a Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module for DTs that continuously integrates new sensor data, detects misalignments, and recalibrates DTs via a query-response framework. Our approach fuses domain-adversarial deep learning with reduced-order simulator guidance to improve context inference and preserve physical consistency. We illustrate the RGA module in a structural health monitoring case study on a steel truss bridge in Pittsburgh, PA, showing faster calibration and better real-world alignment.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11847v1
Analytic theory of dropout regularization,"Dropout is a regularization technique widely used in training artificial neural networks to mitigate overfitting. It consists of dynamically deactivating subsets of the network during training to promote more robust representations. Despite its widespread adoption, dropout probabilities are often selected heuristically, and theoretical explanations of its success remain sparse. Here, we analytically study dropout in two-layer neural networks trained with online stochastic gradient descent. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a set of ordinary differential equations that fully characterize the evolution of the network during training and capture the effects of dropout. We obtain a number of exact results describing the generalization error and the optimal dropout probability at short, intermediate, and long training times. Our analysis shows that dropout reduces detrimental correlations between hidden nodes, mitigates the impact of label noise, and that the optimal dropout probability increases with the level of noise in the data. Our results are validated by extensive numerical simulations.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07792v1
Identifiability of Nonnegative Tucker Decompositions -- Part I: Theory,"Tensor decompositions have become a central tool in data science, with applications in areas such as data analysis, signal processing, and machine learning. A key property of many tensor decompositions, such as the canonical polyadic decomposition, is identifiability: the factors are unique, up to trivial scaling and permutation ambiguities. This allows one to recover the groundtruth sources that generated the data. The Tucker decomposition (TD) is a central and widely used tensor decomposition model. However, it is in general not identifiable. In this paper, we study the identifiability of the nonnegative TD (nTD). By adapting and extending identifiability results of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), we provide uniqueness results for nTD. Our results require the nonnegative matrix factors to have some degree of sparsity (namely, satisfy the separability condition, or the sufficiently scattered condition), while the core tensor only needs to have some slices (or linear combinations of them) or unfoldings with full column rank (but does not need to be nonnegative). Under such conditions, we derive several procedures, using either unfoldings or slices of the input tensor, to obtain identifiable nTDs by minimizing the volume of unfoldings or slices of the core tensor.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12713v1
Scalable Computations for Generalized Mixed Effects Models with Crossed   Random Effects Using Krylov Subspace Methods,"Mixed effects models are widely used for modeling data with hierarchically grouped structures and high-cardinality categorical predictor variables. However, for high-dimensional crossed random effects, current standard computations relying on Cholesky decompositions can become prohibitively slow. In this work, we present novel Krylov subspace-based methods that address several existing computational bottlenecks. Among other things, we theoretically analyze and empirically evaluate various preconditioners for the conjugate gradient and stochastic Lanczos quadrature methods, derive new convergence results, and develop computationally efficient methods for calculating predictive variances. Extensive experiments using simulated and real-world data sets show that our proposed methods scale much better than Cholesky-based computations, for instance, achieving a runtime reduction of approximately two orders of magnitudes for both estimation and prediction. Moreover, our software implementation is up to 10'000 times faster and more stable than state-of-the-art implementations such as lme4 and glmmTMB when using default settings. Our methods are implemented in the free C++ software library GPBoost with high-level Python and R packages.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09552v1
Data-driven Approach for Interpolation of Sparse Data,"Studies of hadron resonances and their properties are limited by the accuracy and consistency of measured datasets, which can originate from many different experiments. We have used Gaussian Processes (GP) to build interpolated datasets, including quantification of uncertainties, so that data from different sources can be used in model fitting without the need for arbitrary weighting. GPs predict values and uncertainties of observables at any kinematic point. Bayesian inference is used to optimise the hyperparameters of the GP model. We demonstrate that the GP successfully interpolates data with quantified uncertainties by comparison with generated pseudodata. We also show that this methodology can be used to investigate the consistency of data from different sources. GPs provide a robust, model-independent method for interpolating typical datasets used in hadron resonance studies, removing the limitations of arbitrary weighting in sparse datasets.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01473v1
J1: Exploring Simple Test-Time Scaling for LLM-as-a-Judge,"The current focus of AI research is shifting from emphasizing model training towards enhancing evaluation quality, a transition that is crucial for driving further advancements in AI systems. Traditional evaluation methods typically rely on reward models assigning scalar preference scores to outputs. Although effective, such approaches lack interpretability, leaving users often uncertain about why a reward model rates a particular response as high or low. The advent of LLM-as-a-Judge provides a more scalable and interpretable method of supervision, offering insights into the decision-making process. Moreover, with the emergence of large reasoning models, which consume more tokens for deeper thinking and answer refinement, scaling test-time computation in the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm presents an avenue for further boosting performance and providing more interpretability through reasoning traces. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{J1-7B}$, which is first supervised fine-tuned on reflection-enhanced datasets collected via rejection-sampling and subsequently trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with verifiable rewards. At inference time, we apply Simple Test-Time Scaling (STTS) strategies for additional performance improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that $\textbf{J1-7B}$ surpasses the previous state-of-the-art LLM-as-a-Judge by $ \textbf{4.8}$\% and exhibits a $ \textbf{5.1}$\% stronger scaling trend under STTS. Additionally, we present three key findings: (1) Existing LLM-as-a-Judge does not inherently exhibit such scaling trend. (2) Model simply fine-tuned on reflection-enhanced datasets continues to demonstrate similarly weak scaling behavior. (3) Significant scaling trend emerges primarily during the RL phase, suggesting that effective STTS capability is acquired predominantly through RL training.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11875v1
On Next-Token Prediction in LLMs: How End Goals Determine the   Consistency of Decoding Algorithms,"Probabilistic next-token prediction trained using cross-entropy loss is the basis of most large language models. Given a sequence of previous values, next-token prediction assigns a probability to each possible next value in the vocabulary. There are many ways to use next-token prediction to output token sequences. This paper examines a few of these algorithms (greedy, lookahead, random sampling, and temperature-scaled random sampling) and studies their consistency with respect to various goals encoded as loss functions. Although consistency of surrogate losses with respect to a target loss function is a well researched topic, we are the first to study it in the context of LLMs (to the best of our knowledge). We find that, so long as next-token prediction converges to its true probability distribution, random sampling is consistent with outputting sequences that mimic sampling from the true probability distribution. For the other goals, such as minimizing the 0-1 loss on the entire sequence, we show no polynomial-time algorithm is optimal for all probability distributions and all decoding algorithms studied are only optimal for a subset of probability distributions. When analyzing these results, we see that there is a dichotomy created between the goals of information retrieval and creative generation for the decoding algorithms. This shows that choosing the correct decoding algorithm based on the desired goal is extremely important and many of the ones used are lacking theoretical grounding in numerous scenarios.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11183v1
Model Merging in Pre-training of Large Language Models,"Model merging has emerged as a promising technique for enhancing large language models, though its application in large-scale pre-training remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of model merging techniques during the pre-training process. Through extensive experiments with both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures ranging from millions to over 100 billion parameters, we demonstrate that merging checkpoints trained with constant learning rates not only achieves significant performance improvements but also enables accurate prediction of annealing behavior. These improvements lead to both more efficient model development and significantly lower training costs. Our detailed ablation studies on merging strategies and hyperparameters provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms while uncovering novel applications. Through comprehensive experimental analysis, we offer the open-source community practical pre-training guidelines for effective model merging.",ML,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12082v1
MOSAIC: A Multi-View 2.5D Organ Slice Selector with Cross-Attentional   Reasoning for Anatomically-Aware CT Localization in Medical Organ   Segmentation,"Efficient and accurate multi-organ segmentation from abdominal CT volumes is a fundamental challenge in medical image analysis. Existing 3D segmentation approaches are computationally and memory intensive, often processing entire volumes that contain many anatomically irrelevant slices. Meanwhile, 2D methods suffer from class imbalance and lack cross-view contextual awareness. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, anatomically-aware slice selector pipeline that reduces input volume prior to segmentation. Our unified framework introduces a vision-language model (VLM) for cross-view organ presence detection using fused tri-slice (2.5D) representations from axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. Our proposed model acts as an ""expert"" in anatomical localization, reasoning over multi-view representations to selectively retain slices with high structural relevance. This enables spatially consistent filtering across orientations while preserving contextual cues. More importantly, since standard segmentation metrics such as Dice or IoU fail to measure the spatial precision of such slice selection, we introduce a novel metric, Slice Localization Concordance (SLC), which jointly captures anatomical coverage and spatial alignment with organ-centric reference slices. Unlike segmentation-specific metrics, SLC provides a model-agnostic evaluation of localization fidelity. Our model offers substantial improvement gains against several baselines across all organs, demonstrating both accurate and reliable organ-focused slice filtering. These results show that our method enables efficient and spatially consistent organ filtering, thereby significantly reducing downstream segmentation cost while maintaining high anatomical fidelity.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10672v1
Advanced Integration of Discrete Line Segments in Digitized P&ID for   Continuous Instrument Connectivity,"Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) constitute the foundational blueprint of a plant, depicting the interconnections among process equipment, instrumentation for process control, and the flow of fluids and control signals. In their existing setup, the manual mapping of information from P&ID sheets holds a significant challenge. This is a time-consuming process, taking around 3-6 months, and is susceptible to errors. It also depends on the expertise of the domain experts and often requires multiple rounds of review. The digitization of P&IDs entails merging detected line segments, which is essential for linking various detected instruments, thereby creating a comprehensive digitized P&ID. This paper focuses on explaining how line segments which are detected using a computer vision model are merged and eventually building the connection between equipment and merged lines. Hence presenting a digitized form of information stating the interconnection between process equipment, instrumentation, flow of fluids and control signals. Eventually, which can be stored in a knowledge graph and that information along with the help of advanced algorithms can be leveraged for tasks like finding optimal routes, detecting system cycles, computing transitive closures, and more.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11976v1
Bridging the Inter-Domain Gap through Low-Level Features for Cross-Modal   Medical Image Segmentation,"This paper addresses the task of cross-modal medical image segmentation by exploring unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches. We propose a model-agnostic UDA framework, LowBridge, which builds on a simple observation that cross-modal images share some similar low-level features (e.g., edges) as they are depicting the same structures. Specifically, we first train a generative model to recover the source images from their edge features, followed by training a segmentation model on the generated source images, separately. At test time, edge features from the target images are input to the pretrained generative model to generate source-style target domain images, which are then segmented using the pretrained segmentation network. Despite its simplicity, extensive experiments on various publicly available datasets demonstrate that \proposed achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming eleven existing UDA approaches under different settings. Notably, further ablation studies show that \proposed is agnostic to different types of generative and segmentation models, suggesting its potential to be seamlessly plugged with the most advanced models to achieve even more outstanding results in the future. The code is available at https://github.com/JoshuaLPF/LowBridge.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11909v1
Facial Recognition Leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks,"Face recognition performance based on deep learning heavily relies on large-scale training data, which is often difficult to acquire in practical applications. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a GAN-based data augmentation method with three key contributions: (1) a residual-embedded generator to alleviate gradient vanishing/exploding problems, (2) an Inception ResNet-V1 based FaceNet discriminator for improved adversarial training, and (3) an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes data generation and recognition performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves stable training dynamics and significantly improves face recognition accuracy by 12.7% on the LFW benchmark compared to baseline methods, while maintaining good generalization capability with limited training samples.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11884v1
Kornia-rs: A Low-Level 3D Computer Vision Library In Rust,"We present \textit{kornia-rs}, a high-performance 3D computer vision library written entirely in native Rust, designed for safety-critical and real-time applications. Unlike C++-based libraries like OpenCV or wrapper-based solutions like OpenCV-Rust, \textit{kornia-rs} is built from the ground up to leverage Rust's ownership model and type system for memory and thread safety. \textit{kornia-rs} adopts a statically-typed tensor system and a modular set of crates, providing efficient image I/O, image processing and 3D operations.

Empirical results show that \textit{kornia-rs} achieves a 3~ 5 times speedup in image transformation tasks over native Rust alternatives, while offering comparable performance to C++ wrapper-based libraries. In addition to 2D vision capabilities, \textit{kornia-rs} addresses a significant gap in the Rust ecosystem by providing a set of 3D computer vision operators.

MVPainter: Accurate and Detailed 3D Texture Generation via Multi-View   Diffusion with Geometric Control,"Recently, significant advances have been made in 3D object generation. Building upon the generated geometry, current pipelines typically employ image diffusion models to generate multi-view RGB images, followed by UV texture reconstruction through texture baking. While 3D geometry generation has improved significantly, supported by multiple open-source frameworks, 3D texture generation remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate 3D texture generation through the lens of three core dimensions: reference-texture alignment, geometry-texture consistency, and local texture quality. To tackle these issues, we propose MVPainter, which employs data filtering and augmentation strategies to enhance texture fidelity and detail, and introduces ControlNet-based geometric conditioning to improve texture-geometry alignment. Furthermore, we extract physically-based rendering (PBR) attributes from the generated views to produce PBR meshes suitable for real-world rendering applications. MVPainter achieves state-of-the-art results across all three dimensions, as demonstrated by human-aligned evaluations. To facilitate further research and reproducibility, we also release our full pipeline as an open-source system, including data construction, model architecture, and evaluation tools.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12635v1
Spectral-Spatial Self-Supervised Learning for Few-Shot Hyperspectral   Image Classification,"Few-shot classification of hyperspectral images (HSI) faces the challenge of scarce labeled samples. Self-Supervised learning (SSL) and Few-Shot Learning (FSL) offer promising avenues to address this issue. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs and lack sufficient spectral prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a method, Spectral-Spatial Self-Supervised Learning for Few-Shot Hyperspectral Image Classification (S4L-FSC), aimed at improving the performance of few-shot HSI classification. Specifically, we first leverage heterogeneous datasets to pretrain a spatial feature extractor using a designed Rotation-Mirror Self-Supervised Learning (RM-SSL) method, combined with FSL. This approach enables the model to learn the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs using rotation and mirroring labels as supervisory signals, while acquiring transferable spatial meta-knowledge through few-shot learning. Subsequently, homogeneous datasets are utilized to pretrain a spectral feature extractor via a combination of FSL and Masked Reconstruction Self-Supervised Learning (MR-SSL). The model learns to reconstruct original spectral information from randomly masked spectral vectors, inferring spectral dependencies. In parallel, FSL guides the model to extract pixel-level discriminative features, thereby embedding rich spectral priors into the model. This spectral-spatial pretraining method, along with the integration of knowledge from heterogeneous and homogeneous sources, significantly enhances model performance. Extensive experiments on four HSI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed S4L-FSC approach for few-shot HSI classification.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12482v1
Advancing Multiple Instance Learning with Continual Learning for Whole   Slide Imaging,"Advances in medical imaging and deep learning have propelled progress in whole slide image (WSI) analysis, with multiple instance learning (MIL) showing promise for efficient and accurate diagnostics. However, conventional MIL models often lack adaptability to evolving datasets, as they rely on static training that cannot incorporate new information without extensive retraining. Applying continual learning (CL) to MIL models is a possible solution, but often sees limited improvements. In this paper, we analyze CL in the context of attention MIL models and find that the model forgetting is mainly concentrated in the attention layers of the MIL model. Using the results of this analysis we propose two components for improving CL on MIL: Attention Knowledge Distillation (AKD) and the Pseudo-Bag Memory Pool (PMP). AKD mitigates catastrophic forgetting by focusing on retaining attention layer knowledge between learning sessions, while PMP reduces the memory footprint by selectively storing only the most informative patches, or ``pseudo-bags'' from WSIs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly improves both accuracy and memory efficiency on diverse WSI datasets, outperforming current state-of-the-art CL methods. This work provides a foundation for CL in large-scale, weakly annotated clinical datasets, paving the way for more adaptable and resilient diagnostic models.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10649v1
DDAE++: Enhancing Diffusion Models Towards Unified Generative and   Discriminative Learning,"While diffusion models have gained prominence in image synthesis, their generative pre-training has been shown to yield discriminative representations, paving the way towards unified visual generation and understanding. However, two key questions remain: 1) Can these representations be leveraged to improve the training of diffusion models themselves, rather than solely benefiting downstream tasks? 2) Can the feature quality be enhanced to rival or even surpass modern self-supervised learners, without compromising generative capability? This work addresses these questions by introducing self-conditioning, a straightforward yet effective mechanism that internally leverages the rich semantics inherent in denoising network to guide its own decoding layers, forming a tighter bottleneck that condenses high-level semantics to improve generation. Results are compelling: our method boosts both generation FID and recognition accuracy with 1% computational overhead and generalizes across diverse diffusion architectures. Crucially, self-conditioning facilitates an effective integration of discriminative techniques, such as contrastive self-distillation, directly into diffusion models without sacrificing generation quality. Extensive experiments on pixel-space and latent-space datasets show that in linear evaluations, our enhanced diffusion models, particularly UViT and DiT, serve as strong representation learners, surpassing various self-supervised models.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10999v1
SageAttention3: Microscaling FP4 Attention for Inference and An   Exploration of 8-Bit Training,"The efficiency of attention is important due to its quadratic time complexity. We enhance the efficiency of attention through two key contributions: First, we leverage the new FP4 Tensor Cores in Blackwell GPUs to accelerate attention computation. Our implementation achieves 1038 TOPS on RTX5090, which is a 5x speedup over the fastest FlashAttention on RTX5090. Experiments show that our FP4 attention can accelerate inference of various models in a plug-and-play way. Second, we pioneer low-bit attention to training tasks. Existing low-bit attention works like FlashAttention3 and SageAttention focus only on inference. However, the efficiency of training large models is also important. To explore whether low-bit attention can be effectively applied to training tasks, we design an accurate and efficient 8-bit attention for both forward and backward propagation. Experiments indicate that 8-bit attention achieves lossless performance in fine-tuning tasks but exhibits slower convergence in pretraining tasks. The code will be available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11594v1
FiGKD: Fine-Grained Knowledge Distillation via High-Frequency Detail   Transfer,"Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely adopted technique for transferring knowledge from a high-capacity teacher model to a smaller student model by aligning their output distributions. However, existing methods often underperform in fine-grained visual recognition tasks, where distinguishing subtle differences between visually similar classes is essential. This performance gap stems from the fact that conventional approaches treat the teacher's output logits as a single, undifferentiated signal-assuming all contained information is equally beneficial to the student. Consequently, student models may become overloaded with redundant signals and fail to capture the teacher's nuanced decision boundaries. To address this issue, we propose Fine-Grained Knowledge Distillation (FiGKD), a novel frequency-aware framework that decomposes a model's logits into low-frequency (content) and high-frequency (detail) components using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). FiGKD selectively transfers only the high-frequency components, which encode the teacher's semantic decision patterns, while discarding redundant low-frequency content already conveyed through ground-truth supervision. Our approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and requires no access to intermediate feature maps. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and multiple fine-grained recognition benchmarks show that FiGKD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art logit-based and feature-based distillation methods across a variety of teacher-student configurations. These findings confirm that frequency-aware logit decomposition enables more efficient and effective knowledge transfer, particularly in resource-constrained settings.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11897v1
iSegMan: Interactive Segment-and-Manipulate 3D Gaussians,"The efficient rendering and explicit nature of 3DGS promote the advancement of 3D scene manipulation. However, existing methods typically encounter challenges in controlling the manipulation region and are unable to furnish the user with interactive feedback, which inevitably leads to unexpected results. Intuitively, incorporating interactive 3D segmentation tools can compensate for this deficiency. Nevertheless, existing segmentation frameworks impose a pre-processing step of scene-specific parameter training, which limits the efficiency and flexibility of scene manipulation. To deliver a 3D region control module that is well-suited for scene manipulation with reliable efficiency, we propose interactive Segment-and-Manipulate 3D Gaussians (iSegMan), an interactive segmentation and manipulation framework that only requires simple 2D user interactions in any view. To propagate user interactions to other views, we propose Epipolar-guided Interaction Propagation (EIP), which innovatively exploits epipolar constraint for efficient and robust interaction matching. To avoid scene-specific training to maintain efficiency, we further propose the novel Visibility-based Gaussian Voting (VGV), which obtains 2D segmentations from SAM and models the region extraction as a voting game between 2D Pixels and 3D Gaussians based on Gaussian visibility. Taking advantage of the efficient and precise region control of EIP and VGV, we put forth a Manipulation Toolbox to implement various functions on selected regions, enhancing the controllability, flexibility and practicality of scene manipulation. Extensive results on 3D scene manipulation and segmentation tasks fully demonstrate the significant advantages of iSegMan.

ORQA: A Benchmark and Foundation Model for Holistic Operating Room   Modeling,"The real-world complexity of surgeries necessitates surgeons to have deep and holistic comprehension to ensure precision, safety, and effective interventions. Computational systems are required to have a similar level of comprehension within the operating room. Prior works, limited to single-task efforts like phase recognition or scene graph generation, lack scope and generalizability. In this work, we introduce ORQA, a novel OR question answering benchmark and foundational multimodal model to advance OR intelligence. By unifying all four public OR datasets into a comprehensive benchmark, we enable our approach to concurrently address a diverse range of OR challenges. The proposed multimodal large language model fuses diverse OR signals such as visual, auditory, and structured data, for a holistic modeling of the OR. Finally, we propose a novel, progressive knowledge distillation paradigm, to generate a family of models optimized for different speed and memory requirements. We show the strong performance of ORQA on our proposed benchmark, and its zero-shot generalization, paving the way for scalable, unified OR modeling and significantly advancing multimodal surgical intelligence.

VISTA: Enhancing Vision-Text Alignment in MLLMs via Cross-Modal Mutual   Information Maximization,"Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face a critical challenge in modality alignment, often exhibiting a bias towards textual information at the expense of other modalities like vision. This paper conducts a systematic information-theoretic analysis of the widely used cross-entropy loss in MLLMs, uncovering its implicit alignment objective. Our theoretical investigation reveals that this implicit objective has inherent limitations, leading to a degradation of cross-modal alignment as text sequence length increases, thereby hindering effective multimodal information fusion. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose Vision-Text Alignment (VISTA), a novel approach guided by our theoretical insights. VISTA introduces an explicit alignment objective designed to maximize cross-modal mutual information, preventing the degradation of visual alignment. Notably, VISTA enhances the visual understanding capabilities of existing MLLMs without requiring any additional trainable modules or extra training data, making it both efficient and practical. Our method significantly outperforms baseline models across more than a dozen benchmark datasets, including VQAv2, MMStar, and MME, paving the way for new directions in MLLM modal alignment research.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10917v2
A Light and Smart Wearable Platform with Multimodal Foundation Model for   Enhanced Spatial Reasoning in People with Blindness and Low Vision,"People with blindness and low vision (pBLV) face significant challenges, struggling to navigate environments and locate objects due to limited visual cues. Spatial reasoning is crucial for these individuals, as it enables them to understand and interpret the spatial relationships in their surroundings, enhancing their ability to navigate and interact more safely and independently. Current multi-modal large language (MLLM) models for low vision people lack the spatial reasoning capabilities needed to effectively assist in these tasks. Moreover, there is a notable absence of lightweight, easy-to-use systems that allow pBLV to effectively perceive and interact with their surrounding environment. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial enhanced multi-modal large language model based approach for visually impaired individuals. By fine-tuning the MLLM to incorporate spatial reasoning capabilities, our method significantly improves the understanding of environmental context, which is critical for navigation and object recognition. The innovation extends to a hardware component, designed as an attachment for glasses, ensuring increased accessibility and ease of use. This integration leverages advanced VLMs to interpret visual data and provide real-time, spatially aware feedback to the user. Our approach aims to bridge the gap between advanced machine learning models and practical, user-friendly assistive devices, offering a robust solution for visually impaired users to navigate their surroundings more effectively and independently. The paper includes an in-depth evaluation using the VizWiz dataset, demonstrating substantial improvements in accuracy and user experience. Additionally, we design a comprehensive dataset to evaluate our method's effectiveness in realworld situations, demonstrating substantial improvements in accuracy and user experience.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10875v1
Unifying Segment Anything in Microscopy with Multimodal Large Language   Model,"Accurate segmentation of regions of interest in biomedical images holds substantial value in image analysis. Although several foundation models for biomedical segmentation have currently achieved excellent performance on certain datasets, they typically demonstrate sub-optimal performance on unseen domain data. We owe the deficiency to lack of vision-language knowledge before segmentation. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) bring outstanding understanding and reasoning capabilities to multimodal tasks, which inspires us to leverage MLLMs to inject Vision-Language Knowledge (VLK), thereby enabling vision models to demonstrate superior generalization capabilities on cross-domain datasets. In this paper, we propose using MLLMs to guide SAM in learning microscopy crose-domain data, unifying Segment Anything in Microscopy, named uLLSAM. Specifically, we propose the Vision-Language Semantic Alignment (VLSA) module, which injects VLK into Segment Anything Model (SAM). We find that after SAM receives global VLK prompts, its performance improves significantly, but there are deficiencies in boundary contour perception. Therefore, we further propose Semantic Boundary Regularization (SBR) to prompt SAM. Our method achieves performance improvements of 7.71% in Dice and 12.10% in SA across 9 in-domain microscopy datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our method also demonstrates improvements of 6.79% in Dice and 10.08% in SA across 10 out-ofdomain datasets, exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.

RB-SCD: A New Benchmark for Semantic Change Detection of Roads and   Bridges in Traffic Scenes,"Accurate detection of changes in roads and bridges, such as construction, renovation, and demolition, is essential for urban planning and traffic management. However, existing methods often struggle to extract fine-grained semantic change information due to the lack of high-quality annotated datasets in traffic scenarios. To address this, we introduce the Road and Bridge Semantic Change Detection (RB-SCD) dataset, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 260 pairs of high-resolution remote sensing images from diverse cities and countries. RB-SCD captures 11 types of semantic changes across varied road and bridge structures, enabling detailed structural and functional analysis. Building on this dataset, we propose a novel framework, Multimodal Frequency-Driven Change Detector (MFDCD), which integrates multimodal features in the frequency domain. MFDCD includes a Dynamic Frequency Coupler (DFC) that fuses hierarchical visual features with wavelet-based frequency components, and a Textual Frequency Filter (TFF) that transforms CLIP-derived textual features into the frequency domain and applies graph-based filtering. Experimental results on RB-SCD and three public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13212v1
Hyperspectral Image Land Cover Captioning Dataset for Vision Language   Models,"We introduce HyperCap, the first large-scale hyperspectral captioning dataset designed to enhance model performance and effectiveness in remote sensing applications. Unlike traditional hyperspectral imaging (HSI) datasets that focus solely on classification tasks, HyperCap integrates spectral data with pixel-wise textual annotations, enabling deeper semantic understanding of hyperspectral imagery. This dataset enhances model performance in tasks like classification and feature extraction, providing a valuable resource for advanced remote sensing applications. HyperCap is constructed from four benchmark datasets and annotated through a hybrid approach combining automated and manual methods to ensure accuracy and consistency. Empirical evaluations using state-of-the-art encoders and diverse fusion techniques demonstrate significant improvements in classification performance. These results underscore the potential of vision-language learning in HSI and position HyperCap as a foundational dataset for future research in the field.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12217v1
CompAlign: Improving Compositional Text-to-Image Generation with a   Complex Benchmark and Fine-Grained Feedback,"State-of-the-art T2I models are capable of generating high-resolution images given textual prompts. However, they still struggle with accurately depicting compositional scenes that specify multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relations. We present CompAlign, a challenging benchmark with an emphasis on assessing the depiction of 3D-spatial relationships, for evaluating and improving models on compositional image generation. CompAlign consists of 900 complex multi-subject image generation prompts that combine numerical and 3D-spatial relationships with varied attribute bindings. Our benchmark is remarkably challenging, incorporating generation tasks with 3+ generation subjects with complex 3D-spatial relationships. Additionally, we propose CompQuest, an interpretable and accurate evaluation framework that decomposes complex prompts into atomic sub-questions, then utilizes a MLLM to provide fine-grained binary feedback on the correctness of each aspect of generation elements in model-generated images. This enables precise quantification of alignment between generated images and compositional prompts. Furthermore, we propose an alignment framework that uses CompQuest's feedback as preference signals to improve diffusion models' compositional image generation abilities. Using adjustable per-image preferences, our method is easily scalable and flexible for different tasks. Evaluation of 9 T2I models reveals that: (1) models remarkable struggle more with compositional tasks with more complex 3D-spatial configurations, and (2) a noticeable performance gap exists between open-source accessible models and closed-source commercial models. Further empirical study on using CompAlign for model alignment yield promising results: post-alignment diffusion models achieve remarkable improvements in compositional accuracy, especially on complex generation tasks, outperforming previous approaches.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11178v1
TS-VLM: Text-Guided SoftSort Pooling for Vision-Language Models in   Multi-View Driving Reasoning,"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable potential in advancing autonomous driving by leveraging multi-modal fusion in order to enhance scene perception, reasoning, and decision-making. Despite their potential, existing models suffer from computational overhead and inefficient integration of multi-view sensor data that make them impractical for real-time deployment in safety-critical autonomous driving applications. To address these shortcomings, this paper is devoted to designing a lightweight VLM called TS-VLM, which incorporates a novel Text-Guided SoftSort Pooling (TGSSP) module. By resorting to semantics of the input queries, TGSSP ranks and fuses visual features from multiple views, enabling dynamic and query-aware multi-view aggregation without reliance on costly attention mechanisms. This design ensures the query-adaptive prioritization of semantically related views, which leads to improved contextual accuracy in multi-view reasoning for autonomous driving. Extensive evaluations on the DriveLM benchmark demonstrate that, on the one hand, TS-VLM outperforms state-of-the-art models with a BLEU-4 score of 56.82, METEOR of 41.91, ROUGE-L of 74.64, and CIDEr of 3.39. On the other hand, TS-VLM reduces computational cost by up to 90%, where the smallest version contains only 20.1 million parameters, making it more practical for real-time deployment in autonomous vehicles.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12670v1
Temporally-Grounded Language Generation: A Benchmark for Real-Time   Vision-Language Models,"Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in offline tasks such as image captioning and video question answering. However, real-time interactive environments impose new demands on VLMs, requiring them to generate utterances that are not only semantically accurate but also precisely timed. We identify two core capabilities necessary for such settings -- $\textit{perceptual updating}$ and $\textit{contingency awareness}$ -- and propose a new benchmark task, $\textbf{Temporally-Grounded Language Generation (TGLG)}$, to evaluate them. TGLG requires models to generate utterances in response to streaming video such that both content and timing align with dynamic visual input. To support this benchmark, we curate evaluation datasets from sports broadcasting and egocentric human interaction domains, and introduce a new metric, $\textbf{TRACE}$, to evaluate TGLG by jointly measuring semantic similarity and temporal alignment. Finally, we present $\textbf{Vision-Language Model with Time-Synchronized Interleaving (VLM-TSI)}$, a model that interleaves visual and linguistic tokens in a time-synchronized manner, enabling real-time language generation without relying on turn-based assumptions. Experimental results show that VLM-TSI significantly outperforms a strong baseline, yet overall performance remains modest -- highlighting the difficulty of TGLG and motivating further research in real-time VLMs. Code and data available $\href{https://github.com/yukw777/tglg}{here}$.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11326v1
WildDoc: How Far Are We from Achieving Comprehensive and Robust Document   Understanding in the Wild?,"The rapid advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced capabilities in Document Understanding. However, prevailing benchmarks like DocVQA and ChartQA predominantly comprise \textit{scanned or digital} documents, inadequately reflecting the intricate challenges posed by diverse real-world scenarios, such as variable illumination and physical distortions. This paper introduces WildDoc, the inaugural benchmark designed specifically for assessing document understanding in natural environments. WildDoc incorporates a diverse set of manually captured document images reflecting real-world conditions and leverages document sources from established benchmarks to facilitate comprehensive comparisons with digital or scanned documents. Further, to rigorously evaluate model robustness, each document is captured four times under different conditions. Evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs on WildDoc expose substantial performance declines and underscore the models' inadequate robustness compared to traditional benchmarks, highlighting the unique challenges posed by real-world document understanding.

Multimodal Cancer Survival Analysis via Hypergraph Learning with   Cross-Modality Rebalance,"Multimodal pathology-genomic analysis has become increasingly prominent in cancer survival prediction. However, existing studies mainly utilize multi-instance learning to aggregate patch-level features, neglecting the information loss of contextual and hierarchical details within pathology images. Furthermore, the disparity in data granularity and dimensionality between pathology and genomics leads to a significant modality imbalance. The high spatial resolution inherent in pathology data renders it a dominant role while overshadowing genomics in multimodal integration. In this paper, we propose a multimodal survival prediction framework that incorporates hypergraph learning to effectively capture both contextual and hierarchical details from pathology images. Moreover, it employs a modality rebalance mechanism and an interactive alignment fusion strategy to dynamically reweight the contributions of the two modalities, thereby mitigating the pathology-genomics imbalance. Quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on five TCGA datasets, demonstrating that our model outperforms advanced methods by over 3.4\% in C-Index performance.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11997v1
Style Customization of Text-to-Vector Generation with Image Diffusion   Priors,"Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are highly favored by designers due to their resolution independence and well-organized layer structure. Although existing text-to-vector (T2V) generation methods can create SVGs from text prompts, they often overlook an important need in practical applications: style customization, which is vital for producing a collection of vector graphics with consistent visual appearance and coherent aesthetics. Extending existing T2V methods for style customization poses certain challenges. Optimization-based T2V models can utilize the priors of text-to-image (T2I) models for customization, but struggle with maintaining structural regularity. On the other hand, feed-forward T2V models can ensure structural regularity, yet they encounter difficulties in disentangling content and style due to limited SVG training data.   To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage style customization pipeline for SVG generation, making use of the advantages of both feed-forward T2V models and T2I image priors. In the first stage, we train a T2V diffusion model with a path-level representation to ensure the structural regularity of SVGs while preserving diverse expressive capabilities. In the second stage, we customize the T2V diffusion model to different styles by distilling customized T2I models. By integrating these techniques, our pipeline can generate high-quality and diverse SVGs in custom styles based on text prompts in an efficient feed-forward manner. The effectiveness of our method has been validated through extensive experiments. The project page is https://customsvg.github.io.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10558v1

Featuring a compact architecture, it enables more efficient training and faster inference than existing models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses current operational NWP systems, extrapolation-based methods, and deep-learning nowcasting models, setting a new standard for high-resolution precipitation forecasting in Europe, ensuring a balance between accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10271v1
CheX-DS: Improving Chest X-ray Image Classification with Ensemble   Learning Based on DenseNet and Swin Transformer,"The automatic diagnosis of chest diseases is a popular and challenging task. Most current methods are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which focus on local features while neglecting global features. Recently, self-attention mechanisms have been introduced into the field of computer vision, demonstrating superior performance. Therefore, this paper proposes an effective model, CheX-DS, for classifying long-tail multi-label data in the medical field of chest X-rays. The model is based on the excellent CNN model DenseNet for medical imaging and the newly popular Swin Transformer model, utilizing ensemble deep learning techniques to combine the two models and leverage the advantages of both CNNs and Transformers. The loss function of CheX-DS combines weighted binary cross-entropy loss with asymmetric loss, effectively addressing the issue of data imbalance. The NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset is selected to evaluate the model's effectiveness.

To address these limitations, we propose MIRAGE, a multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate models' capabilities in Counting (object attribute recognition), Relation (spatial relational reasoning), and Counting with Relation. Through diverse and complex scenarios requiring fine-grained recognition and reasoning, MIRAGE highlights critical limitations in state-of-the-art models, underscoring the need for improved representations and reasoning frameworks. By targeting these foundational abilities, MIRAGE provides a pathway toward spatiotemporal reasoning in future research.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10604v1
RGB-to-Polarization Estimation: A New Task and Benchmark Study,"Polarization images provide rich physical information that is fundamentally absent from standard RGB images, benefiting a wide range of computer vision applications such as reflection separation and material classification. However, the acquisition of polarization images typically requires additional optical components, which increases both the cost and the complexity of the applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task: RGB-to-polarization image estimation, which aims to infer polarization information directly from RGB images. In this work, we establish the first comprehensive benchmark for this task by leveraging existing polarization datasets and evaluating a diverse set of state-of-the-art deep learning models, including both restoration-oriented and generative architectures. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, our benchmark not only establishes the current performance ceiling of RGB-to-polarization estimation, but also systematically reveals the respective strengths and limitations of different model families -- such as direct reconstruction versus generative synthesis, and task-specific training versus large-scale pre-training. In addition, we provide some potential directions for future research on polarization estimation. This benchmark is intended to serve as a foundational resource to facilitate the design and evaluation of future methods for polarization estimation from standard RGB inputs.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13050v1
A Study on the Refining Handwritten Font by Mixing Font Styles,"Handwritten fonts have a distinct expressive character, but they are often difficult to read due to unclear or inconsistent handwriting. FontFusionGAN (FFGAN) is a novel method for improving handwritten fonts by combining them with printed fonts. Our method implements generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate font that mix the desirable features of handwritten and printed fonts. By training the GAN on a dataset of handwritten and printed fonts, it can generate legible and visually appealing font images. We apply our method to a dataset of handwritten fonts and demonstrate that it significantly enhances the readability of the original fonts while preserving their unique aesthetic. Our method has the potential to improve the readability of handwritten fonts, which would be helpful for a variety of applications including document creation, letter writing, and assisting individuals with reading and writing difficulties. In addition to addressing the difficulties of font creation for languages with complex character sets, our method is applicable to other text-image-related tasks, such as font attribute control and multilingual font style transfer.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12834v1
The Way Up: A Dataset for Hold Usage Detection in Sport Climbing,"Detecting an athlete's position on a route and identifying hold usage are crucial in various climbing-related applications. However, no climbing dataset with detailed hold usage annotations exists to our knowledge. To address this issue, we introduce a dataset of 22 annotated climbing videos, providing ground-truth labels for hold locations, usage order, and time of use. Furthermore, we explore the application of keypoint-based 2D pose-estimation models for detecting hold usage in sport climbing. We determine usage by analyzing the key points of certain joints and the corresponding overlap with climbing holds. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art models and analyze their accuracy on our dataset, identifying and highlighting climbing-specific challenges. Our dataset and results highlight key challenges in climbing-specific pose estimation and establish a foundation for future research toward AI-assisted systems for sports climbing.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12854v1
GeoMM: On Geodesic Perspective for Multi-modal Learning,"Geodesic distance serves as a reliable means of measuring distance in nonlinear spaces, and such nonlinear manifolds are prevalent in the current multimodal learning. In these scenarios, some samples may exhibit high similarity, yet they convey different semantics, making traditional distance metrics inadequate for distinguishing between positive and negative samples. This paper introduces geodesic distance as a novel distance metric in multi-modal learning for the first time, to mine correlations between samples, aiming to address the limitations of common distance metric. Our approach incorporates a comprehensive series of strategies to adapt geodesic distance for the current multimodal learning. Specifically, we construct a graph structure to represent the adjacency relationships among samples by thresholding distances between them and then apply the shortest-path algorithm to obtain geodesic distance within this graph. To facilitate efficient computation, we further propose a hierarchical graph structure through clustering and combined with incremental update strategies for dynamic status updates. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating its capability to capture complex relationships between samples and improve the performance of multimodal learning models.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11216v1
SMFusion: Semantic-Preserving Fusion of Multimodal Medical Images for   Enhanced Clinical Diagnosis,"Multimodal medical image fusion plays a crucial role in medical diagnosis by integrating complementary information from different modalities to enhance image readability and clinical applicability. However, existing methods mainly follow computer vision standards for feature extraction and fusion strategy formulation, overlooking the rich semantic information inherent in medical images. To address this limitation, we propose a novel semantic-guided medical image fusion approach that, for the first time, incorporates medical prior knowledge into the fusion process. Specifically, we construct a publicly available multimodal medical image-text dataset, upon which text descriptions generated by BiomedGPT are encoded and semantically aligned with image features in a high-dimensional space via a semantic interaction alignment module. During this process, a cross attention based linear transformation automatically maps the relationship between textual and visual features to facilitate comprehensive learning. The aligned features are then embedded into a text-injection module for further feature-level fusion. Unlike traditional methods, we further generate diagnostic reports from the fused images to assess the preservation of medical information. Additionally, we design a medical semantic loss function to enhance the retention of textual cues from the source images. Experimental results on test datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while preserving more critical medical information.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12251v1
Towards Cross-modal Retrieval in Chinese Cultural Heritage Documents:   Dataset and Solution,"China has a long and rich history, encompassing a vast cultural heritage that includes diverse multimodal information, such as silk patterns, Dunhuang murals, and their associated historical narratives. Cross-modal retrieval plays a pivotal role in understanding and interpreting Chinese cultural heritage by bridging visual and textual modalities to enable accurate text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval. However, despite the growing interest in multimodal research, there is a lack of specialized datasets dedicated to Chinese cultural heritage, limiting the development and evaluation of cross-modal learning models in this domain. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal dataset named CulTi, which contains 5,726 image-text pairs extracted from two series of professional documents, respectively related to ancient Chinese silk and Dunhuang murals. Compared to existing general-domain multimodal datasets, CulTi presents a challenge for cross-modal retrieval: the difficulty of local alignment between intricate decorative motifs and specialized textual descriptions. To address this challenge, we propose LACLIP, a training-free local alignment strategy built upon a fine-tuned Chinese-CLIP. LACLIP enhances the alignment of global textual descriptions with local visual regions by computing weighted similarity scores during inference. Experimental results on CulTi demonstrate that LACLIP significantly outperforms existing models in cross-modal retrieval, particularly in handling fine-grained semantic associations within Chinese cultural heritage.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10921v1
Industry-focused Synthetic Segmentation Pre-training,"Pre-training on real-image datasets has been widely proven effective for improving instance segmentation. However, industrial applications face two key challenges: (1) legal and ethical restrictions, such as ImageNet's prohibition of commercial use, and (2) limited transferability due to the domain gap between web images and industrial imagery. Even recent vision foundation models, including the segment anything model (SAM), show notable performance degradation in industrial settings. These challenges raise critical questions: Can we build a vision foundation model for industrial applications without relying on real images or manual annotations? And can such models outperform even fine-tuned SAM on industrial datasets? To address these questions, we propose the Instance Core Segmentation Dataset (InsCore), a synthetic pre-training dataset based on formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL). InsCore generates fully annotated instance segmentation images that reflect key characteristics of industrial data, including complex occlusions, dense hierarchical masks, and diverse non-rigid shapes, distinct from typical web imagery. Unlike previous methods, InsCore requires neither real images nor human annotations. Experiments on five industrial datasets show that models pre-trained with InsCore outperform those trained on COCO and ImageNet-21k, as well as fine-tuned SAM, achieving an average improvement of 6.2 points in instance segmentation performance. This result is achieved using only 100k synthetic images, more than 100 times fewer than the 11 million images in SAM's SA-1B dataset, demonstrating the data efficiency of our approach. These findings position InsCore as a practical and license-free vision foundation model for industrial applications.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13099v1
HWA-UNETR: Hierarchical Window Aggregate UNETR for 3D Multimodal Gastric   Lesion Segmentation,"Multimodal medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in the context of gastric cancer lesion analysis. This clinical context is defined by the scarcity of independent multimodal datasets and the imperative to amalgamate inherently misaligned modalities. As a result, algorithms are constrained to train on approximate data and depend on application migration, leading to substantial resource expenditure and a potential decline in analysis accuracy. To address those challenges, we have made two major contributions: First, we publicly disseminate the GCM 2025 dataset, which serves as the first large-scale, open-source collection of gastric cancer multimodal MRI scans, featuring professionally annotated FS-T2W, CE-T1W, and ADC images from 500 patients. Second, we introduce HWA-UNETR, a novel 3D segmentation framework that employs an original HWA block with learnable window aggregation layers to establish dynamic feature correspondences between different modalities' anatomical structures, and leverages the innovative tri-orientated fusion mamba mechanism for context modeling and capturing long-range spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments on our GCM 2025 dataset and the publicly BraTS 2021 dataset validate the performance of our framework, demonstrating that the new approach surpasses existing methods by up to 1.68\% in the Dice score while maintaining solid robustness.

Textured mesh Quality Assessment using Geometry and Color Field   Similarity,"Textured mesh quality assessment (TMQA) is critical for various 3D mesh applications. However, existing TMQA methods often struggle to provide accurate and robust evaluations. Motivated by the effectiveness of fields in representing both 3D geometry and color information, we propose a novel point-based TMQA method called field mesh quality metric (FMQM). FMQM utilizes signed distance fields and a newly proposed color field named nearest surface point color field to realize effective mesh feature description. Four features related to visual perception are extracted from the geometry and color fields: geometry similarity, geometry gradient similarity, space color distribution similarity, and space color gradient similarity. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that FMQM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) TMQA metrics. Furthermore, FMQM exhibits low computational complexity, making it a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications in 3D graphics and visualization.

SSR: Enhancing Depth Perception in Vision-Language Models via   Rationale-Guided Spatial Reasoning,"Despite impressive advancements in Visual-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal tasks, their reliance on RGB inputs limits precise spatial understanding. Existing methods for integrating spatial cues, such as point clouds or depth, either require specialized sensors or fail to effectively exploit depth information for higher-order reasoning. To this end, we propose a novel Spatial Sense and Reasoning method, dubbed SSR, a novel framework that transforms raw depth data into structured, interpretable textual rationales. These textual rationales serve as meaningful intermediate representations to significantly enhance spatial reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we leverage knowledge distillation to compress the generated rationales into compact latent embeddings, which facilitate resource-efficient and plug-and-play integration into existing VLMs without retraining. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new dataset named SSR-CoT, a million-scale visual-language reasoning dataset enriched with intermediate spatial reasoning annotations, and present SSRBench, a comprehensive multi-task benchmark. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate SSR substantially improves depth utilization and enhances spatial reasoning, thereby advancing VLMs toward more human-like multi-modal understanding.

GMM-Based Comprehensive Feature Extraction and Relative Distance   Preservation For Few-Shot Cross-Modal Retrieval,"Few-shot cross-modal retrieval focuses on learning cross-modal representations with limited training samples, enabling the model to handle unseen classes during inference. Unlike traditional cross-modal retrieval tasks, which assume that both training and testing data share the same class distribution, few-shot retrieval involves data with sparse representations across modalities. Existing methods often fail to adequately model the multi-peak distribution of few-shot cross-modal data, resulting in two main biases in the latent semantic space: intra-modal bias, where sparse samples fail to capture intra-class diversity, and inter-modal bias, where misalignments between image and text distributions exacerbate the semantic gap. These biases hinder retrieval accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, GCRDP, for few-shot cross-modal retrieval. This approach effectively captures the complex multi-peak distribution of data using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and incorporates a multi-positive sample contrastive learning mechanism for comprehensive feature modeling. Additionally, we introduce a new strategy for cross-modal semantic alignment, which constrains the relative distances between image and text feature distributions, thereby improving the accuracy of cross-modal representations. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance over six state-of-the-art methods.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13306v1
CLIP Embeddings for AI-Generated Image Detection: A Few-Shot Study with   Lightweight Classifier,"Verifying the authenticity of AI-generated images presents a growing challenge on social media platforms these days. While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP outdo in multimodal representation, their capacity for AI-generated image classification is underexplored due to the absence of such labels during the pre-training process. This work investigates whether CLIP embeddings inherently contain information indicative of AI generation. A proposed pipeline extracts visual embeddings using a frozen CLIP model, feeds its embeddings to lightweight networks, and fine-tunes only the final classifier. Experiments on the public CIFAKE benchmark show the performance reaches 95% accuracy without language reasoning. Few-shot adaptation to curated custom with 20% of the data results in performance to 85%. A closed-source baseline (Gemini-2.0) has the best zero-shot accuracy yet fails on specific styles. Notably, some specific image types, such as wide-angle photographs and oil paintings, pose significant challenges to classification. These results indicate previously unexplored difficulties in classifying certain types of AI-generated images, revealing new and more specific questions in this domain that are worth further investigation.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10664v1
ElderFallGuard: Real-Time IoT and Computer Vision-Based Fall Detection   System for Elderly Safety,"For the elderly population, falls pose a serious and increasing risk of serious injury and loss of independence. In order to overcome this difficulty, we present ElderFallGuard: A Computer Vision Based IoT Solution for Elderly Fall Detection and Notification, a cutting-edge, non-invasive system intended for quick caregiver alerts and real-time fall detection. Our approach leverages the power of computer vision, utilizing MediaPipe for accurate human pose estimation from standard video streams. We developed a custom dataset comprising 7200 samples across 12 distinct human poses to train and evaluate various machine learning classifiers, with Random Forest ultimately selected for its superior performance. ElderFallGuard employs a specific detection logic, identifying a fall when a designated prone pose (""Pose6"") is held for over 3 seconds coupled with a significant drop in motion detected for more than 2 seconds. Upon confirmation, the system instantly dispatches an alert, including a snapshot of the event, to a designated Telegram group via a custom bot, incorporating cooldown logic to prevent notification overload. Rigorous testing on our dataset demonstrated exceptional results, achieving 100% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. ElderFallGuard offers a promising, vision-based IoT solution to enhance elderly safety and provide peace of mind for caregivers through intelligent, timely alerts.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11845v1
PRS-Med: Position Reasoning Segmentation with Vision-Language Model in   Medical Imaging,"Recent advancements in prompt-based medical image segmentation have enabled clinicians to identify tumors using simple input like bounding boxes or text prompts. However, existing methods face challenges when doctors need to interact through natural language or when position reasoning is required - understanding spatial relationships between anatomical structures and pathologies. We present PRS-Med, a framework that integrates vision-language models with segmentation capabilities to generate both accurate segmentation masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. Additionally, we introduce the MMRS dataset (Multimodal Medical in Positional Reasoning Segmentation), which provides diverse, spatially-grounded question-answer pairs to address the lack of position reasoning data in medical imaging. PRS-Med demonstrates superior performance across six imaging modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, ultrasound, endoscopy, RGB), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both segmentation accuracy and position reasoning. Our approach enables intuitive doctor-system interaction through natural language, facilitating more efficient diagnoses. Our dataset pipeline, model, and codebase will be released to foster further research in spatially-aware multimodal reasoning for medical applications.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11872v1
CL-BioGAN: Biologically-Inspired Cross-Domain Continual Learning for   Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection,"Memory stability and learning flexibility in continual learning (CL) is a core challenge for cross-scene Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection (HAD) task. Biological neural networks can actively forget history knowledge that conflicts with the learning of new experiences by regulating learning-triggered synaptic expansion and synaptic convergence. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Biologically-Inspired Continual Learning Generative Adversarial Network (CL-BioGAN) for augmenting continuous distribution fitting ability for cross-domain HAD task, where Continual Learning Bio-inspired Loss (CL-Bio Loss) and self-attention Generative Adversarial Network (BioGAN) are incorporated to realize forgetting history knowledge as well as involving replay strategy in the proposed BioGAN. Specifically, a novel Bio-Inspired Loss composed with an Active Forgetting Loss (AF Loss) and a CL loss is designed to realize parameters releasing and enhancing between new task and history tasks from a Bayesian perspective. Meanwhile, BioGAN loss with L2-Norm enhances self-attention (SA) to further balance the stability and flexibility for better fitting background distribution for open scenario HAD (OHAD) tasks. Experiment results underscore that the proposed CL-BioGAN can achieve more robust and satisfying accuracy for cross-domain HAD with fewer parameters and computation cost. This dual contribution not only elevates CL performance but also offers new insights into neural adaptation mechanisms in OHAD task.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11796v1
Temporal-Oriented Recipe for Transferring Large Vision-Language Model to   Video Understanding,"Recent years have witnessed outstanding advances of large vision-language models (LVLMs). In order to tackle video understanding, most of them depend upon their implicit temporal understanding capacity. As such, they have not deciphered important components that contribute to temporal understanding ability, which might limit the potential of these LVLMs for video understanding. In this work, we conduct a thorough empirical study to demystify crucial components that influence the temporal understanding of LVLMs. Our empirical study reveals that significant impacts are centered around the intermediate interface between the visual encoder and the large language model. Building on these insights, we propose a temporal-oriented recipe that encompasses temporal-oriented training schemes and an upscaled interface. Our final model developed using our recipe significantly enhances previous LVLMs on standard video understanding tasks.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12605v1
Adaptive Spatial Transcriptomics Interpolation via Cross-modal   Cross-slice Modeling,"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a promising technique that characterizes the spatial gene profiling patterns within the tissue context. Comprehensive ST analysis depends on consecutive slices for 3D spatial insights, whereas the missing intermediate tissue sections and high costs limit the practical feasibility of generating multi-slice ST. In this paper, we propose C2-STi, the first attempt for interpolating missing ST slices at arbitrary intermediate positions between adjacent ST slices. Despite intuitive, effective ST interpolation presents significant challenges, including 1) limited continuity across heterogeneous tissue sections, 2) complex intrinsic correlation across genes, and 3) intricate cellular structures and biological semantics within each tissue section. To mitigate these challenges, in C2-STi, we design 1) a distance-aware local structural modulation module to adaptively capture cross-slice deformations and enhance positional correlations between ST slices, 2) a pyramid gene co-expression correlation module to capture multi-scale biological associations among genes, and 3) a cross-modal alignment module that integrates the ST-paired hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images to filter and align the essential cellular features across ST and H\&E images. Extensive experiments on the public dataset demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art approaches on both single-slice and multi-slice ST interpolation.

LiDAR MOT-DETR: A LiDAR-based Two-Stage Transformer for 3D Multiple   Object Tracking,"Multi-object tracking from LiDAR point clouds presents unique challenges due to the sparse and irregular nature of the data, compounded by the need for temporal coherence across frames. Traditional tracking systems often rely on hand-crafted features and motion models, which can struggle to maintain consistent object identities in crowded or fast-moving scenes. We present a lidar-based two-staged DETR inspired transformer; a smoother and tracker. The smoother stage refines lidar object detections, from any off-the-shelf detector, across a moving temporal window. The tracker stage uses a DETR-based attention block to maintain tracks across time by associating tracked objects with the refined detections using the point cloud as context. The model is trained on the datasets nuScenes and KITTI in both online and offline (forward peeking) modes demonstrating strong performance across metrics such as ID-switch and multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA). The numerical results indicate that the online mode outperforms the lidar-only baseline and SOTA models on the nuScenes dataset, with an aMOTA of 0.722 and an aMOTP of 0.475, while the offline mode provides an additional 3 pp aMOTP",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12753v1
Joint Manifold Learning and Optimal Transport for Dynamic Imaging,"Dynamic imaging is critical for understanding and visualizing dynamic biological processes in medicine and cell biology. These applications often encounter the challenge of a limited amount of time series data and time points, which hinders learning meaningful patterns. Regularization methods provide valuable prior knowledge to address this challenge, enabling the extraction of relevant information despite the scarcity of time-series data and time points. In particular, low-dimensionality assumptions on the image manifold address sample scarcity, while time progression models, such as optimal transport (OT), provide priors on image development to mitigate the lack of time points. Existing approaches using low-dimensionality assumptions disregard a temporal prior but leverage information from multiple time series. OT-prior methods, however, incorporate the temporal prior but regularize only individual time series, ignoring information from other time series of the same image modality. In this work, we investigate the effect of integrating a low-dimensionality assumption of the underlying image manifold with an OT regularizer for time-evolving images. In particular, we propose a latent model representation of the underlying image manifold and promote consistency between this representation, the time series data, and the OT prior on the time-evolving images. We discuss the advantages of enriching OT interpolations with latent models and integrating OT priors into latent models.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11913v1
MathCoder-VL: Bridging Vision and Code for Enhanced Multimodal   Mathematical Reasoning,"Natural language image-caption datasets, widely used for training Large Multimodal Models, mainly focus on natural scenarios and overlook the intricate details of mathematical figures that are critical for problem-solving, hindering the advancement of current LMMs in multimodal mathematical reasoning. To this end, we propose leveraging code as supervision for cross-modal alignment, since code inherently encodes all information needed to generate corresponding figures, establishing a precise connection between the two modalities. Specifically, we co-develop our image-to-code model and dataset with model-in-the-loop approach, resulting in an image-to-code model, FigCodifier and ImgCode-8.6M dataset, the largest image-code dataset to date. Furthermore, we utilize FigCodifier to synthesize novel mathematical figures and then construct MM-MathInstruct-3M, a high-quality multimodal math instruction fine-tuning dataset. Finally, we present MathCoder-VL, trained with ImgCode-8.6M for cross-modal alignment and subsequently fine-tuned on MM-MathInstruct-3M for multimodal math problem solving. Our model achieves a new open-source SOTA across all six metrics. Notably, it surpasses GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the geometry problem-solving subset of MathVista, achieving improvements of 8.9% and 9.2%.

SOS: A Shuffle Order Strategy for Data Augmentation in Industrial Human   Activity Recognition,"In the realm of Human Activity Recognition (HAR), obtaining high quality and variance data is still a persistent challenge due to high costs and the inherent variability of real-world activities. This study introduces a generation dataset by deep learning approaches (Attention Autoencoder and conditional Generative Adversarial Networks). Another problem that data heterogeneity is a critical challenge, one of the solutions is to shuffle the data to homogenize the distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the random sequence strategy significantly improves classification performance, achieving an accuracy of up to 0.70 $\pm$ 0.03 and a macro F1 score of 0.64 $\pm$ 0.01. For that, disrupting temporal dependencies through random sequence reordering compels the model to focus on instantaneous recognition, thereby improving robustness against activity transitions. This approach not only broadens the effective training dataset but also offers promising avenues for enhancing HAR systems in complex, real-world scenarios.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10312v1
"Benchmarking performance, explainability, and evaluation strategies of   vision-language models for surgery: Challenges and opportunities","Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) presents significant visual and technical challenges, including surgical instrument classification and understanding surgical action involving instruments, verbs, and anatomical targets. While many machine learning-based methods have been developed for surgical understanding, they typically rely on procedure- and task-specific models trained on small, manually annotated datasets. In contrast, the recent success of vision-language models (VLMs) trained on large volumes of raw image-text pairs has demonstrated strong adaptability to diverse visual data and a range of downstream tasks. This opens meaningful research questions: how well do these general-purpose VLMs perform in the surgical domain? In this work, we explore those questions by benchmarking several VLMs across diverse surgical datasets, including general laparoscopic procedures and endoscopic submucosal dissection, to assess their current capabilities and limitations. Our benchmark reveals key gaps in the models' ability to consistently link language to the correct regions in surgical scenes.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10764v1
Consistent Quantity-Quality Control across Scenes for Deployment-Aware   Gaussian Splatting,"To reduce storage and computational costs, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) seeks to minimize the number of Gaussians used while preserving high rendering quality, introducing an inherent trade-off between Gaussian quantity and rendering quality. Existing methods strive for better quantity-quality performance, but lack the ability for users to intuitively adjust this trade-off to suit practical needs such as model deployment under diverse hardware and communication constraints. Here, we present ControlGS, a 3DGS optimization method that achieves semantically meaningful and cross-scene consistent quantity-quality control while maintaining strong quantity-quality performance. Through a single training run using a fixed setup and a user-specified hyperparameter reflecting quantity-quality preference, ControlGS can automatically find desirable quantity-quality trade-off points across diverse scenes, from compact objects to large outdoor scenes. It also outperforms baselines by achieving higher rendering quality with fewer Gaussians, and supports a broad adjustment range with stepless control over the trade-off.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10473v1
Robust Multimodal Segmentation with Representation Regularization and   Hybrid Prototype Distillation,"Multi-modal semantic segmentation (MMSS) faces significant challenges in real-world scenarios due to dynamic environments, sensor failures, and noise interference, creating a gap between theoretical models and practical performance. To address this, we propose a two-stage framework called RobustSeg, which enhances multi-modal robustness through two key components: the Hybrid Prototype Distillation Module (HPDM) and the Representation Regularization Module (RRM). In the first stage, RobustSeg pre-trains a multi-modal teacher model using complete modalities. In the second stage, a student model is trained with random modality dropout while learning from the teacher via HPDM and RRM. HPDM transforms features into compact prototypes, enabling cross-modal hybrid knowledge distillation and mitigating bias from missing modalities. RRM reduces representation discrepancies between the teacher and student by optimizing functional entropy through the log-Sobolev inequality. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that RobustSeg outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of +2.76%, +4.56%, and +0.98%, respectively.

Logos as a Well-Tempered Pre-train for Sign Language Recognition,"This paper examines two aspects of the isolated sign language recognition (ISLR) task. First, despite the availability of a number of datasets, the amount of data for most individual sign languages is limited. It poses the challenge of cross-language ISLR model training, including transfer learning. Second, similar signs can have different semantic meanings. It leads to ambiguity in dataset labeling and raises the question of the best policy for annotating such signs. To address these issues, this study presents Logos, a novel Russian Sign Language (RSL) dataset, the most extensive ISLR dataset by the number of signers and one of the largest available datasets while also the largest RSL dataset in size and vocabulary. It is shown that a model, pre-trained on the Logos dataset can be used as a universal encoder for other language SLR tasks, including few-shot learning. We explore cross-language transfer learning approaches and find that joint training using multiple classification heads benefits accuracy for the target lowresource datasets the most. The key feature of the Logos dataset is explicitly annotated visually similar sign groups. We show that explicitly labeling visually similar signs improves trained model quality as a visual encoder for downstream tasks. Based on the proposed contributions, we outperform current state-of-the-art results for the WLASL dataset and get competitive results for the AUTSL dataset, with a single stream model processing solely RGB video. The source code, dataset, and pre-trained models are publicly available.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10481v1
Swin DiT: Diffusion Transformer using Pseudo Shifted Windows,"Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve remarkable performance within the domain of image generation through the incorporation of the transformer architecture. Conventionally, DiTs are constructed by stacking serial isotropic global information modeling transformers, which face significant computational cost when processing high-resolution images. We empirically analyze that latent space image generation does not exhibit a strong dependence on global information as traditionally assumed. Most of the layers in the model demonstrate redundancy in global computation. In addition, conventional attention mechanisms exhibit low-frequency inertia issues. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{P}seudo \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{W}indow \textbf{A}ttention (PSWA), which fundamentally mitigates global model redundancy. PSWA achieves intermediate global-local information interaction through window attention, while employing a high-frequency bridging branch to simulate shifted window operations, supplementing appropriate global and high-frequency information. Furthermore, we propose the Progressive Coverage Channel Allocation(PCCA) strategy that captures high-order attention similarity without additional computational cost. Building upon all of them, we propose a series of Pseudo \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{Win}dow DiTs (\textbf{Swin DiT}), accompanied by extensive experiments demonstrating their superior performance. For example, our proposed Swin-DiT-L achieves a 54%$\uparrow$ FID improvement over DiT-XL/2 while requiring less computational. https://github.com/wujiafu007/Swin-DiT",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13219v1
Patho-R1: A Multimodal Reinforcement Learning-Based Pathology Expert   Reasoner,"Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled broad progress in the general medical field. However, pathology still remains a more challenging subdomain, with current pathology specific VLMs exhibiting limitations in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning plausibility. Such shortcomings are largely attributable to the nature of current pathology datasets, which are primarily composed of image description pairs that lack the depth and structured diagnostic paradigms employed by real world pathologists. In this study, we leverage pathology textbooks and real world pathology experts to construct high-quality, reasoning-oriented datasets. Building on this, we introduce Patho-R1, a multimodal RL-based pathology Reasoner, trained through a three-stage pipeline: (1) continued pretraining on 3.5 million image-text pairs for knowledge infusion; (2) supervised fine-tuning on 500k high-quality Chain-of-Thought samples for reasoning incentivizing; (3) reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization and Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization strategies for multimodal reasoning quality refinement. To further assess the alignment quality of our dataset, we propose PathoCLIP, trained on the same figure-caption corpus used for continued pretraining. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that both PathoCLIP and Patho-R1 achieve robust performance across a wide range of pathology-related tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, Visual Question Answering, and Multiple Choice Question. Our project is available at the Patho-R1 repository: https://github.com/Wenchuan-Zhang/Patho-R1.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11404v1
DD-Ranking: Rethinking the Evaluation of Dataset Distillation,"In recent years, dataset distillation has provided a reliable solution for data compression, where models trained on the resulting smaller synthetic datasets achieve performance comparable to those trained on the original datasets. To further improve the performance of synthetic datasets, various training pipelines and optimization objectives have been proposed, greatly advancing the field of dataset distillation. Recent decoupled dataset distillation methods introduce soft labels and stronger data augmentation during the post-evaluation phase and scale dataset distillation up to larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet-1K). However, this raises a question: Is accuracy still a reliable metric to fairly evaluate dataset distillation methods? Our empirical findings suggest that the performance improvements of these methods often stem from additional techniques rather than the inherent quality of the images themselves, with even randomly sampled images achieving superior results. Such misaligned evaluation settings severely hinder the development of DD. Therefore, we propose DD-Ranking, a unified evaluation framework, along with new general evaluation metrics to uncover the true performance improvements achieved by different methods. By refocusing on the actual information enhancement of distilled datasets, DD-Ranking provides a more comprehensive and fair evaluation standard for future research advancements.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13300v1
Planar Velocity Estimation for Fast-Moving Mobile Robots Using   Event-Based Optical Flow,"Accurate velocity estimation is critical in mobile robotics, particularly for driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. Wheel odometry fused with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data is a widely used method for velocity estimation; however, it typically requires strong assumptions, such as non-slip steering, or complex vehicle dynamics models that do not hold under varying environmental conditions like slippery surfaces. We introduce an approach to velocity estimation that is decoupled from wheel-to-surface traction assumptions by leveraging planar kinematics in combination with optical flow from event cameras pointed perpendicularly at the ground. The asynchronous micro-second latency and high dynamic range of event cameras make them highly robust to motion blur, a common challenge in vision-based perception techniques for autonomous driving. The proposed method is evaluated through in-field experiments on a 1:10 scale autonomous racing platform and compared to precise motion capture data, demonstrating not only performance on par with the state-of-the-art Event-VIO method but also a 38.3 % improvement in lateral error. Qualitative experiments at highway speeds of up to 32 m/s further confirm the effectiveness of our approach, indicating significant potential for real-world deployment.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11116v1
Enhancing Transformers Through Conditioned Embedded Tokens,"Transformers have transformed modern machine learning, driving breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. At the core of their success lies the attention mechanism, which enables the modeling of global dependencies among input tokens. However, we reveal that the attention block in transformers suffers from inherent ill-conditioning, which hampers gradient-based optimization and leads to inefficient training. To address this, we develop a theoretical framework that establishes a direct relationship between the conditioning of the attention block and that of the embedded tokenized data. Building on this insight, we introduce conditioned embedded tokens, a method that systematically modifies the embedded tokens to improve the conditioning of the attention mechanism. Our analysis demonstrates that this approach significantly mitigates ill-conditioning, leading to more stable and efficient training. We validate our methodology across various transformer architectures, achieving consistent improvements in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and natural language processing, highlighting its broad applicability and effectiveness.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12789v1
Pretrained hybrid transformer for generalizable cardiac substructures   segmentation from contrast and non-contrast CTs in lung and breast cancers,"AI automated segmentations for radiation treatment planning (RTP) can deteriorate when applied in clinical cases with different characteristics than training dataset. Hence, we refined a pretrained transformer into a hybrid transformer convolutional network (HTN) to segment cardiac substructures lung and breast cancer patients acquired with varying imaging contrasts and patient scan positions. Cohort I, consisting of 56 contrast-enhanced (CECT) and 124 non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans from patients with non-small cell lung cancers acquired in supine position, was used to create oracle with all 180 training cases and balanced (CECT: 32, NCCT: 32 training) HTN models. Models were evaluated on a held-out validation set of 60 cohort I patients and 66 patients with breast cancer from cohort II acquired in supine (n=45) and prone (n=21) positions. Accuracy was measured using DSC, HD95, and dose metrics. Publicly available TotalSegmentator served as the benchmark. The oracle and balanced models were similarly accurate (DSC Cohort I: 0.80 \pm 0.10 versus 0.81 \pm 0.10; Cohort II: 0.77 \pm 0.13 versus 0.80 \pm 0.12), outperforming TotalSegmentator. The balanced model, using half the training cases as oracle, produced similar dose metrics as manual delineations for all cardiac substructures. This model was robust to CT contrast in 6 out of 8 substructures and patient scan position variations in 5 out of 8 substructures and showed low correlations of accuracy to patient size and age. A HTN demonstrated robustly accurate (geometric and dose metrics) cardiac substructures segmentation from CTs with varying imaging and patient characteristics, one key requirement for clinical use. Moreover, the model combining pretraining with balanced distribution of NCCT and CECT scans was able to provide reliably accurate segmentations under varied conditions with far fewer labeled datasets compared to an oracle model.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10855v1
"HISTAI: An Open-Source, Large-Scale Whole Slide Image Dataset for   Computational Pathology","Recent advancements in Digital Pathology (DP), particularly through artificial intelligence and Foundation Models, have underscored the importance of large-scale, diverse, and richly annotated datasets. Despite their critical role, publicly available Whole Slide Image (WSI) datasets often lack sufficient scale, tissue diversity, and comprehensive clinical metadata, limiting the robustness and generalizability of AI models. In response, we introduce the HISTAI dataset, a large, multimodal, open-access WSI collection comprising over 60,000 slides from various tissue types. Each case in the HISTAI dataset is accompanied by extensive clinical metadata, including diagnosis, demographic information, detailed pathological annotations, and standardized diagnostic coding.

Predicting Reaction Time to Comprehend Scenes with Foveated Scene   Understanding Maps,"Although models exist that predict human response times (RTs) in tasks such as target search and visual discrimination, the development of image-computable predictors for scene understanding time remains an open challenge. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs), which can generate scene descriptions for arbitrary images, combined with the availability of quantitative metrics for comparing linguistic descriptions, offer a new opportunity to model human scene understanding. We hypothesize that the primary bottleneck in human scene understanding and the driving source of variability in response times across scenes is the interaction between the foveated nature of the human visual system and the spatial distribution of task-relevant visual information within an image. Based on this assumption, we propose a novel image-computable model that integrates foveated vision with VLMs to produce a spatially resolved map of scene understanding as a function of fixation location (Foveated Scene Understanding Map, or F-SUM), along with an aggregate F-SUM score. This metric correlates with average (N=17) human RTs (r=0.47) and number of saccades (r=0.51) required to comprehend a scene (across 277 scenes). The F-SUM score also correlates with average (N=16) human description accuracy (r=-0.56) in time-limited presentations. These correlations significantly exceed those of standard image-based metrics such as clutter, visual complexity, and scene ambiguity based on language entropy. Together, our work introduces a new image-computable metric for predicting human response times in scene understanding and demonstrates the importance of foveated visual processing in shaping comprehension difficulty.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12660v1
Entropy-Driven Genetic Optimization for Deep-Feature-Guided Low-Light   Image Enhancement,"Image enhancement methods often prioritize pixel level information, overlooking the semantic features. We propose a novel, unsupervised, fuzzy-inspired image enhancement framework guided by NSGA-II algorithm that optimizes image brightness, contrast, and gamma parameters to achieve a balance between visual quality and semantic fidelity. Central to our proposed method is the use of a pre trained deep neural network as a feature extractor. To find the best enhancement settings, we use a GPU-accelerated NSGA-II algorithm that balances multiple objectives, namely, increasing image entropy, improving perceptual similarity, and maintaining appropriate brightness. We further improve the results by applying a local search phase to fine-tune the top candidates from the genetic algorithm. Our approach operates entirely without paired training data making it broadly applicable across domains with limited or noisy labels. Quantitatively, our model achieves excellent performance with average BRISQUE and NIQE scores of 19.82 and 3.652, respectively, in all unpaired datasets. Qualitatively, enhanced images by our model exhibit significantly improved visibility in shadowed regions, natural balance of contrast and also preserve the richer fine detail without introducing noticable artifacts. This work opens new directions for unsupervised image enhancement where semantic consistency is critical.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11246v1
Completely Weakly Supervised Class-Incremental Learning for Semantic   Segmentation,"This work addresses the task of completely weakly supervised class-incremental learning for semantic segmentation to learn segmentation for both base and additional novel classes using only image-level labels. While class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) is crucial for handling diverse and newly emerging objects in the real world, traditional CISS methods require expensive pixel-level annotations for training. To overcome this limitation, partially weakly-supervised approaches have recently been proposed. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a completely weakly-supervised method for CISS. To achieve this, we propose to generate robust pseudo-labels by combining pseudo-labels from a localizer and a sequence of foundation models based on their uncertainty. Moreover, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we introduce an exemplar-guided data augmentation method that generates diverse images containing both previous and novel classes with guidance. Finally, we conduct experiments in three common experimental settings: 15-5 VOC, 10-10 VOC, and COCO-to-VOC, and in two scenarios: disjoint and overlap. The experimental results demonstrate that our completely weakly supervised method outperforms even partially weakly supervised methods in the 15-5 VOC and 10-10 VOC settings while achieving competitive accuracy in the COCO-to-VOC setting.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10781v1
"IQBench: How ""Smart'' Are Vision-Language Models? A Study with Human IQ   Tests","Although large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of multimodal tasks, their true reasoning capabilities on human IQ tests remain underexplored. To advance research on the fluid intelligence of VLMs, we introduce **IQBench**, a new benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs on standardized visual IQ tests. We focus on evaluating the reasoning capabilities of VLMs, which we argue are more important than the accuracy of the final prediction. **Our benchmark is visually centric, minimizing the dependence on unnecessary textual content**, thus encouraging models to derive answers primarily from image-based information rather than learned textual knowledge. To this end, we manually collected and annotated 500 visual IQ questions to **prevent unintentional data leakage during training**. Unlike prior work that focuses primarily on the accuracy of the final answer, we evaluate the reasoning ability of the models by assessing their explanations and the patterns used to solve each problem, along with the accuracy of the final prediction and human evaluation. Our experiments show that there are substantial performance disparities between tasks, with models such as `o4-mini`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, and `claude-3.7-sonnet` achieving the highest average accuracies of 0.615, 0.578, and 0.548, respectively. However, all models struggle with 3D spatial and anagram reasoning tasks, highlighting significant limitations in current VLMs' general reasoning abilities. In terms of reasoning scores, `o4-mini`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, and `claude-3.7-sonnet` achieved top averages of 0.696, 0.586, and 0.516, respectively. These results highlight inconsistencies between the reasoning processes of the models and their final answers, emphasizing the importance of evaluating the accuracy of the reasoning in addition to the final predictions.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12000v1
DiCo: Revitalizing ConvNets for Scalable and Efficient Diffusion   Modeling,"Diffusion Transformer (DiT), a promising diffusion model for visual generation, demonstrates impressive performance but incurs significant computational overhead. Intriguingly, analysis of pre-trained DiT models reveals that global self-attention is often redundant, predominantly capturing local patterns-highlighting the potential for more efficient alternatives. In this paper, we revisit convolution as an alternative building block for constructing efficient and expressive diffusion models. However, naively replacing self-attention with convolution typically results in degraded performance. Our investigations attribute this performance gap to the higher channel redundancy in ConvNets compared to Transformers. To resolve this, we introduce a compact channel attention mechanism that promotes the activation of more diverse channels, thereby enhancing feature diversity. This leads to Diffusion ConvNet (DiCo), a family of diffusion models built entirely from standard ConvNet modules, offering strong generative performance with significant efficiency gains. On class-conditional ImageNet benchmarks, DiCo outperforms previous diffusion models in both image quality and generation speed. Notably, DiCo-XL achieves an FID of 2.05 at 256x256 resolution and 2.53 at 512x512, with a 2.7x and 3.1x speedup over DiT-XL/2, respectively.

G1: Bootstrapping Perception and Reasoning Abilities of Vision-Language   Model via Reinforcement Learning,"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in many direct multimodal tasks but struggle to translate this prowess into effective decision-making within interactive, visually rich environments like games. This ``knowing-doing'' gap significantly limits their potential as autonomous agents, as leading VLMs often performing badly in simple games. To address this, we introduce VLM-Gym, a curated reinforcement learning (RL) environment featuring diverse visual games with unified interfaces and adjustable, compositional difficulty, specifically designed for scalable multi-game parallel training. Leveraging VLM-Gym, we train G0 models using pure RL-driven self-evolution, which demonstrate emergent perception and reasoning patterns. To further mitigate challenges arising from game diversity, we develop G1 models. G1 incorporates a perception-enhanced cold start prior to RL fine-tuning. Our resulting G1 models consistently surpass their teacher across all games and outperform leading proprietary models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking. Systematic analysis reveals an intriguing finding: perception and reasoning abilities mutually bootstrap each other throughout the RL training process. Source code including VLM-Gym and RL training are released at https://github.com/chenllliang/G1 to foster future research in advancing VLMs as capable interactive agents.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13426v1
EPIC: Explanation of Pretrained Image Classification Networks via   Prototype,"Explainable AI (XAI) methods generally fall into two categories. Post-hoc approaches generate explanations for pre-trained models and are compatible with various neural network architectures. These methods often use feature importance visualizations, such as saliency maps, to indicate which input regions influenced the model's prediction. Unfortunately, they typically offer a coarse understanding of the model's decision-making process. In contrast, ante-hoc (inherently explainable) methods rely on specially designed model architectures trained from scratch. A notable subclass of these methods provides explanations through prototypes, representative patches extracted from the training data. However, prototype-based approaches have limitations: they require dedicated architectures, involve specialized training procedures, and perform well only on specific datasets. In this work, we propose EPIC (Explanation of Pretrained Image Classification), a novel approach that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Like post-hoc methods, EPIC operates on pre-trained models without architectural modifications. Simultaneously, it delivers intuitive, prototype-based explanations inspired by ante-hoc techniques. To the best of our knowledge, EPIC is the first post-hoc method capable of fully replicating the core explanatory power of inherently interpretable models. We evaluate EPIC on benchmark datasets commonly used in prototype-based explanations, such as CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars, alongside large-scale datasets like ImageNet, typically employed by post-hoc methods. EPIC uses prototypes to explain model decisions, providing a flexible and easy-to-understand tool for creating clear, high-quality explanations.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12897v1
"M4-SAR: A Multi-Resolution, Multi-Polarization, Multi-Scene,   Multi-Source Dataset and Benchmark for Optical-SAR Fusion Object Detection","Single-source remote sensing object detection using optical or SAR images struggles in complex environments. Optical images offer rich textural details but are often affected by low-light, cloud-obscured, or low-resolution conditions, reducing the detection performance. SAR images are robust to weather, but suffer from speckle noise and limited semantic expressiveness. Optical and SAR images provide complementary advantages, and fusing them can significantly improve the detection accuracy. However, progress in this field is hindered by the lack of large-scale, standardized datasets. To address these challenges, we propose the first comprehensive dataset for optical-SAR fusion object detection, named Multi-resolution, Multi-polarization, Multi-scene, Multi-source SAR dataset (M4-SAR). It contains 112,184 precisely aligned image pairs and nearly one million labeled instances with arbitrary orientations, spanning six key categories. To enable standardized evaluation, we develop a unified benchmarking toolkit that integrates six state-of-the-art multi-source fusion methods. Furthermore, we propose E2E-OSDet, a novel end-to-end multi-source fusion detection framework that mitigates cross-domain discrepancies and establishes a robust baseline for future studies. Extensive experiments on M4-SAR demonstrate that fusing optical and SAR data can improve $mAP$ by 5.7\% over single-source inputs, with particularly significant gains in complex environments. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/wchao0601/M4-SAR.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10931v1
VideoRFT: Incentivizing Video Reasoning Capability in MLLMs via   Reinforced Fine-Tuning,"Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has shown great promise in achieving humanlevel reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), and has recently been extended to MLLMs. Nevertheless, reasoning about videos, which is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, remains a persistent challenge due to the complex logic, temporal and causal structures inherent in video data. To fill this gap, we propose VIDEORFT, a novel approach that extends the RFT paradigm to cultivate human-like video reasoning capabilities in MLLMs. VIDEORFT follows the standard two-stage scheme in RFT: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to improve generalization. A central challenge to achieve this in the video domain lies in the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality video CoT datasets. We address this by building a fully automatic CoT curation pipeline. First, we devise a cognitioninspired prompting strategy to elicit a reasoning LLM to generate preliminary CoTs based solely on rich, structured, and literal representations of video content. Subsequently, these CoTs are revised by a visual-language model conditioned on the actual video, ensuring visual consistency and reducing visual hallucinations. This pipeline results in two new datasets - VideoRFT-CoT-102K for SFT and VideoRFT-RL-310K for RL. To further strength the RL phase, we introduce a novel semantic-consistency reward that explicitly promotes the alignment between textual reasoning with visual evidence. This reward encourages the model to produce coherent, context-aware reasoning outputs grounded in visual input. Extensive experiments show that VIDEORFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six video reasoning benchmarks.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12434v1
RetinaLogos: Fine-Grained Synthesis of High-Resolution Retinal Images   Through Captions,"The scarcity of high-quality, labelled retinal imaging data, which presents a significant challenge in the development of machine learning models for ophthalmology, hinders progress in the field. To synthesise Colour Fundus Photographs (CFPs), existing methods primarily relying on predefined disease labels face significant limitations. However, current methods remain limited, thus failing to generate images for broader categories with diverse and fine-grained anatomical structures. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce an innovative pipeline that creates a large-scale, synthetic Caption-CFP dataset comprising 1.4 million entries, called RetinaLogos-1400k. Specifically, RetinaLogos-1400k uses large language models (LLMs) to describe retinal conditions and key structures, such as optic disc configuration, vascular distribution, nerve fibre layers, and pathological features. Furthermore, based on this dataset, we employ a novel three-step training framework, called RetinaLogos, which enables fine-grained semantic control over retinal images and accurately captures different stages of disease progression, subtle anatomical variations, and specific lesion types. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, with 62.07% of text-driven synthetic images indistinguishable from real ones by ophthalmologists. Moreover, the synthetic data improves accuracy by 10%-25% in diabetic retinopathy grading and glaucoma detection, thereby providing a scalable solution to augment ophthalmic datasets.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12887v1
Emergent Active Perception and Dexterity of Simulated Humanoids from   Visual Reinforcement Learning,"Human behavior is fundamentally shaped by visual perception -- our ability to interact with the world depends on actively gathering relevant information and adapting our movements accordingly. Behaviors like searching for objects, reaching, and hand-eye coordination naturally emerge from the structure of our sensory system. Inspired by these principles, we introduce Perceptive Dexterous Control (PDC), a framework for vision-driven dexterous whole-body control with simulated humanoids. PDC operates solely on egocentric vision for task specification, enabling object search, target placement, and skill selection through visual cues, without relying on privileged state information (e.g., 3D object positions and geometries). This perception-as-interface paradigm enables learning a single policy to perform multiple household tasks, including reaching, grasping, placing, and articulated object manipulation. We also show that training from scratch with reinforcement learning can produce emergent behaviors such as active search. These results demonstrate how vision-driven control and complex tasks induce human-like behaviors and can serve as the key ingredients in closing the perception-action loop for animation, robotics, and embodied AI.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12278v1
MoCLIP: Motion-Aware Fine-Tuning and Distillation of CLIP for Human   Motion Generation,"Human motion generation is essential for fields such as animation, robotics, and virtual reality, requiring models that effectively capture motion dynamics from text descriptions. Existing approaches often rely on Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based text encoders, but their training on text-image pairs constrains their ability to understand temporal and kinematic structures inherent in motion and motion generation. This work introduces MoCLIP, a fine-tuned CLIP model with an additional motion encoding head, trained on motion sequences using contrastive learning and tethering loss. By explicitly incorporating motion-aware representations, MoCLIP enhances motion fidelity while remaining compatible with existing CLIP-based pipelines and seamlessly integrating into various CLIP-based methods. Experiments demonstrate that MoCLIP improves Top-1, Top-2, and Top-3 accuracy while maintaining competitive FID, leading to improved text-to-motion alignment results. These results highlight MoCLIP's versatility and effectiveness, establishing it as a robust framework for enhancing motion generation.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10810v1
VLC Fusion: Vision-Language Conditioned Sensor Fusion for Robust Object   Detection,"Although fusing multiple sensor modalities can enhance object detection performance, existing fusion approaches often overlook subtle variations in environmental conditions and sensor inputs. As a result, they struggle to adaptively weight each modality under such variations. To address this challenge, we introduce Vision-Language Conditioned Fusion (VLC Fusion), a novel fusion framework that leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to condition the fusion process on nuanced environmental cues. By capturing high-level environmental context such as as darkness, rain, and camera blurring, the VLM guides the model to dynamically adjust modality weights based on the current scene. We evaluate VLC Fusion on real-world autonomous driving and military target detection datasets that include image, LIDAR, and mid-wave infrared modalities. Our experiments show that VLC Fusion consistently outperforms conventional fusion baselines, achieving improved detection accuracy in both seen and unseen scenarios.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12715v1
Learned Lightweight Smartphone ISP with Unpaired Data,"The Image Signal Processor (ISP) is a fundamental component in modern smartphone cameras responsible for conversion of RAW sensor image data to RGB images with a strong focus on perceptual quality. Recent work highlights the potential of deep learning approaches and their ability to capture details with a quality increasingly close to that of professional cameras. A difficult and costly step when developing a learned ISP is the acquisition of pixel-wise aligned paired data that maps the raw captured by a smartphone camera sensor to high-quality reference images. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a novel training method for a learnable ISP that eliminates the need for direct correspondences between raw images and ground-truth data with matching content. Our unpaired approach employs a multi-term loss function guided by adversarial training with multiple discriminators processing feature maps from pre-trained networks to maintain content structure while learning color and texture characteristics from the target RGB dataset. Using lightweight neural network architectures suitable for mobile devices as backbones, we evaluated our method on the Zurich RAW to RGB and Fujifilm UltraISP datasets. Compared to paired training methods, our unpaired learning strategy shows strong potential and achieves high fidelity across multiple evaluation metrics. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/AndreiiArhire/Learned-Lightweight-Smartphone-ISP-with-Unpaired-Data .",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10420v1
PRETI: Patient-Aware Retinal Foundation Model via Metadata-Guided   Representation Learning,"Retinal foundation models have significantly advanced retinal image analysis by leveraging self-supervised learning to reduce dependence on labeled data while achieving strong generalization. Many recent approaches enhance retinal image understanding using report supervision, but obtaining clinical reports is often costly and challenging. In contrast, metadata (e.g., age, gender) is widely available and serves as a valuable resource for analyzing disease progression. To effectively incorporate patient-specific information, we propose PRETI, a retinal foundation model that integrates metadata-aware learning with robust self-supervised representation learning. We introduce Learnable Metadata Embedding (LME), which dynamically refines metadata representations. Additionally, we construct patient-level data pairs, associating images from the same individual to improve robustness against non-clinical variations. To further optimize retinal image representation, we propose Retina-Aware Adaptive Masking (RAAM), a strategy that selectively applies masking within the retinal region and dynamically adjusts the masking ratio during training. PRETI captures both global structures and fine-grained pathological details, resulting in superior diagnostic performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRETI achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse diseases and biomarker predictions using in-house and public data, indicating the importance of metadata-guided foundation models in retinal disease analysis.

MedSG-Bench: A Benchmark for Medical Image Sequences Grounding,"Visual grounding is essential for precise perception and reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially in medical imaging domains. While existing medical visual grounding benchmarks primarily focus on single-image scenarios, real-world clinical applications often involve sequential images, where accurate lesion localization across different modalities and temporal tracking of disease progression (e.g., pre- vs. post-treatment comparison) require fine-grained cross-image semantic alignment and context-aware reasoning. To remedy the underrepresentation of image sequences in existing medical visual grounding benchmarks, we propose MedSG-Bench, the first benchmark tailored for Medical Image Sequences Grounding. It comprises eight VQA-style tasks, formulated into two paradigms of the grounding tasks, including 1) Image Difference Grounding, which focuses on detecting change regions across images, and 2) Image Consistency Grounding, which emphasizes detection of consistent or shared semantics across sequential images. MedSG-Bench covers 76 public datasets, 10 medical imaging modalities, and a wide spectrum of anatomical structures and diseases, totaling 9,630 question-answer pairs. We benchmark both general-purpose MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL) and medical-domain specialized MLLMs (e.g., HuatuoGPT-vision), observing that even the advanced models exhibit substantial limitations in medical sequential grounding tasks. To advance this field, we construct MedSG-188K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset tailored for sequential visual grounding, and further develop MedSeq-Grounder, an MLLM designed to facilitate future research on fine-grained understanding across medical sequential images. The benchmark, dataset, and model are available at https://huggingface.co/MedSG-Bench",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11852v1
VisionReasoner: Unified Visual Perception and Reasoning via   Reinforcement Learning,"Large vision-language models exhibit inherent capabilities to handle diverse visual perception tasks. In this paper, we introduce VisionReasoner, a unified framework capable of reasoning and solving multiple visual perception tasks within a shared model. Specifically, by designing novel multi-object cognitive learning strategies and systematic task reformulation, VisionReasoner enhances its reasoning capabilities to analyze visual inputs, and addresses diverse perception tasks in a unified framework. The model generates a structured reasoning process before delivering the desired outputs responding to user queries. To rigorously assess unified visual perception capabilities, we evaluate VisionReasoner on ten diverse tasks spanning three critical domains: detection, segmentation, and counting. Experimental results show that VisionReasoner achieves superior performance as a unified model, outperforming Qwen2.5VL by relative margins of 29.1% on COCO (detection), 22.1% on ReasonSeg (segmentation), and 15.3% on CountBench (counting).",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12081v1
Learning to Highlight Audio by Watching Movies,"Recent years have seen a significant increase in video content creation and consumption. Crafting engaging content requires the careful curation of both visual and audio elements. While visual cue curation, through techniques like optimal viewpoint selection or post-editing, has been central to media production, its natural counterpart, audio, has not undergone equivalent advancements. This often results in a disconnect between visual and acoustic saliency. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task: visually-guided acoustic highlighting, which aims to transform audio to deliver appropriate highlighting effects guided by the accompanying video, ultimately creating a more harmonious audio-visual experience. We propose a flexible, transformer-based multimodal framework to solve this task. To train our model, we also introduce a new dataset -- the muddy mix dataset, leveraging the meticulous audio and video crafting found in movies, which provides a form of free supervision. We develop a pseudo-data generation process to simulate poorly mixed audio, mimicking real-world scenarios through a three-step process -- separation, adjustment, and remixing. Our approach consistently outperforms several baselines in both quantitative and subjective evaluation. We also systematically study the impact of different types of contextual guidance and difficulty levels of the dataset.

Concept-Guided Interpretability via Neural Chunking,"Neural networks are often black boxes, reflecting the significant challenge of understanding their internal workings. We propose a different perspective that challenges the prevailing view: rather than being inscrutable, neural networks exhibit patterns in their raw population activity that mirror regularities in the training data. We refer to this as the Reflection Hypothesis and provide evidence for this phenomenon in both simple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and complex large language models (LLMs). Building on this insight, we propose to leverage cognitively-inspired methods of chunking to segment high-dimensional neural population dynamics into interpretable units that reflect underlying concepts. We propose three methods to extract these emerging entities, complementing each other based on label availability and dimensionality. Discrete sequence chunking (DSC) creates a dictionary of entities; population averaging (PA) extracts recurring entities that correspond to known labels; and unsupervised chunk discovery (UCD) can be used when labels are absent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in extracting entities across varying model sizes, ranging from inducing compositionality in RNNs to uncovering recurring neural population states in large models with diverse architectures, and illustrate their advantage over other methods. Throughout, we observe a robust correspondence between the extracted entities and concrete or abstract concepts. Artificially inducing the extracted entities in neural populations effectively alters the network's generation of associated concepts. Our work points to a new direction for interpretability, one that harnesses both cognitive principles and the structure of naturalistic data to reveal the hidden computations of complex learning systems, gradually transforming them from black boxes into systems we can begin to understand.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11576v1
Context-Aware Autoregressive Models for Multi-Conditional Image   Generation,"Autoregressive transformers have recently shown impressive image generation quality and efficiency on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models. Unlike diffusion architectures, autoregressive models can naturally incorporate arbitrary modalities into a single, unified token sequence--offering a concise solution for multi-conditional image generation tasks. In this work, we propose $\textbf{ContextAR}$, a flexible and effective framework for multi-conditional image generation. ContextAR embeds diverse conditions (e.g., canny edges, depth maps, poses) directly into the token sequence, preserving modality-specific semantics. To maintain spatial alignment while enhancing discrimination among different condition types, we introduce hybrid positional encodings that fuse Rotary Position Embedding with Learnable Positional Embedding. We design Conditional Context-aware Attention to reduces computational complexity while preserving effective intra-condition perception. Without any fine-tuning, ContextAR supports arbitrary combinations of conditions during inference time. Experimental results demonstrate the powerful controllability and versatility of our approach, and show that the competitive perpormance than diffusion-based multi-conditional control approaches the existing autoregressive baseline across diverse multi-condition driven scenarios.

Reasoning-OCR: Can Large Multimodal Models Solve Complex Logical   Reasoning Problems from OCR Cues?,"Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have become increasingly versatile, accompanied by impressive Optical Character Recognition (OCR) related capabilities. Existing OCR-related benchmarks emphasize evaluating LMMs' abilities of relatively simple visual question answering, visual-text parsing, etc. However, the extent to which LMMs can deal with complex logical reasoning problems based on OCR cues is relatively unexplored. To this end, we introduce the Reasoning-OCR benchmark, which challenges LMMs to solve complex reasoning problems based on the cues that can be extracted from rich visual-text. Reasoning-OCR covers six visual scenarios and encompasses 150 meticulously designed questions categorized into six reasoning challenges. Additionally, Reasoning-OCR minimizes the impact of field-specialized knowledge. Our evaluation offers some insights for proprietary and open-source LMMs in different reasoning challenges, underscoring the urgent to improve the reasoning performance. We hope Reasoning-OCR can inspire and facilitate future research on enhancing complex reasoning ability based on OCR cues.

Accelerating Diffusion-based Super-Resolution with Dynamic Time-Spatial   Sampling,"Diffusion models have gained attention for their success in modeling complex distributions, achieving impressive perceptual quality in SR tasks. However, existing diffusion-based SR methods often suffer from high computational costs, requiring numerous iterative steps for training and inference. Existing acceleration techniques, such as distillation and solver optimization, are generally task-agnostic and do not fully leverage the specific characteristics of low-level tasks like super-resolution (SR). In this study, we analyze the frequency- and spatial-domain properties of diffusion-based SR methods, revealing key insights into the temporal and spatial dependencies of high-frequency signal recovery. Specifically, high-frequency details benefit from concentrated optimization during early and late diffusion iterations, while spatially textured regions demand adaptive denoising strategies. Building on these observations, we propose the Time-Spatial-aware Sampling strategy (TSS) for the acceleration of Diffusion SR without any extra training cost. TSS combines Time Dynamic Sampling (TDS), which allocates more iterations to refining textures, and Spatial Dynamic Sampling (SDS), which dynamically adjusts strategies based on image content. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TSS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer iterations, improving MUSIQ scores by 0.2 - 3.0 and outperforming the current acceleration methods with only half the number of steps.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12048v1
One Image is Worth a Thousand Words: A Usability Preservable Text-Image   Collaborative Erasing Framework,"Concept erasing has recently emerged as an effective paradigm to prevent text-to-image diffusion models from generating visually undesirable or even harmful content. However, current removal methods heavily rely on manually crafted text prompts, making it challenging to achieve a high erasure (efficacy) while minimizing the impact on other benign concepts (usability). In this paper, we attribute the limitations to the inherent gap between the text and image modalities, which makes it hard to transfer the intricately entangled concept knowledge from text prompts to the image generation process. To address this, we propose a novel solution by directly integrating visual supervision into the erasure process, introducing the first text-image Collaborative Concept Erasing (Co-Erasing) framework. Specifically, Co-Erasing describes the concept jointly by text prompts and the corresponding undesirable images induced by the prompts, and then reduces the generating probability of the target concept through negative guidance. This approach effectively bypasses the knowledge gap between text and image, significantly enhancing erasure efficacy. Additionally, we design a text-guided image concept refinement strategy that directs the model to focus on visual features most relevant to the specified text concept, minimizing disruption to other benign concepts. Finally, comprehensive experiments suggest that Co-Erasing outperforms state-of-the-art erasure approaches significantly with a better trade-off between efficacy and usability.

Benchmarking Unified Face Attack Detection via Hierarchical Prompt   Tuning,"Presentation Attack Detection and Face Forgery Detection are designed to protect face data from physical media-based Presentation Attacks and digital editing-based DeepFakes respectively. But separate training of these two models makes them vulnerable to unknown attacks and burdens deployment environments. The lack of a Unified Face Attack Detection model to handle both types of attacks is mainly due to two factors. First, there's a lack of adequate benchmarks for models to explore. Existing UAD datasets have limited attack types and samples, restricting the model's ability to address advanced threats. To address this, we propose UniAttackDataPlus (UniAttackData+), the most extensive and sophisticated collection of forgery techniques to date. It includes 2,875 identities and their 54 kinds of falsified samples, totaling 697,347 videos. Second, there's a lack of a reliable classification criterion. Current methods try to find an arbitrary criterion within the same semantic space, which fails when encountering diverse attacks. So, we present a novel Visual-Language Model-based Hierarchical Prompt Tuning Framework (HiPTune) that adaptively explores multiple classification criteria from different semantic spaces. We build a Visual Prompt Tree to explore various classification rules hierarchically. Then, by adaptively pruning the prompts, the model can select the most suitable prompts to guide the encoder to extract discriminative features at different levels in a coarse-to-fine way. Finally, to help the model understand the classification criteria in visual space, we propose a Dynamically Prompt Integration module to project the visual prompts to the text encoder for more accurate semantics. Experiments on 12 datasets have shown the potential to inspire further innovations in the UAD field.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13327v1
LatentINDIGO: An INN-Guided Latent Diffusion Algorithm for Image   Restoration,"There is a growing interest in the use of latent diffusion models (LDMs) for image restoration (IR) tasks due to their ability to model effectively the distribution of natural images. While significant progress has been made, there are still key challenges that need to be addressed. First, many approaches depend on a predefined degradation operator, making them ill-suited for complex or unknown degradations that deviate from standard analytical models. Second, many methods struggle to provide a stable guidance in the latent space and finally most methods convert latent representations back to the pixel domain for guidance at every sampling iteration, which significantly increases computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a wavelet-inspired invertible neural network (INN) that simulates degradations through a forward transform and reconstructs lost details via the inverse transform. We further integrate this design into a latent diffusion pipeline through two proposed approaches: LatentINDIGO-PixelINN, which operates in the pixel domain, and LatentINDIGO-LatentINN, which stays fully in the latent space to reduce complexity. Both approaches alternate between updating intermediate latent variables under the guidance of our INN and refining the INN forward model to handle unknown degradations. In addition, a regularization step preserves the proximity of latent variables to the natural image manifold. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world low-quality images, and can be readily adapted to arbitrary output sizes.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12935v1
Computer Vision Models Show Human-Like Sensitivity to Geometric and   Topological Concepts,"With the rapid improvement of machine learning (ML) models, cognitive scientists are increasingly asking about their alignment with how humans think. Here, we ask this question for computer vision models and human sensitivity to geometric and topological (GT) concepts. Under the core knowledge account, these concepts are innate and supported by dedicated neural circuitry. In this work, we investigate an alternative explanation, that GT concepts are learned ``for free'' through everyday interaction with the environment. We do so using computer visions models, which are trained on large image datasets. We build on prior studies to investigate the overall performance and human alignment of three classes of models -- convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformer-based models, and vision-language models -- on an odd-one-out task testing 43 GT concepts spanning seven classes. Transformer-based models achieve the highest overall accuracy, surpassing that of young children. They also show strong alignment with children's performance, finding the same classes of concepts easy vs. difficult. By contrast, vision-language models underperform their vision-only counterparts and deviate further from human profiles, indicating that na\""ive multimodality might compromise abstract geometric sensitivity. These findings support the use of computer vision models to evaluate the sufficiency of the learning account for explaining human sensitivity to GT concepts, while also suggesting that integrating linguistic and visual representations might have unpredicted deleterious consequences.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13281v1
Multi-Token Prediction Needs Registers,"Multi-token prediction has emerged as a promising objective for improving language model pretraining, but its benefits have not consistently generalized to other settings such as fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose MuToR, a simple and effective approach to multi-token prediction that interleaves learnable register tokens into the input sequence, each tasked with predicting future targets. Compared to existing methods, MuToR offers several key advantages: it introduces only a negligible number of additional parameters, requires no architectural changes--ensuring compatibility with off-the-shelf pretrained language models--and remains aligned with the next-token pretraining objective, making it especially well-suited for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover, it naturally supports scalable prediction horizons. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of MuToR across a range of use cases, including supervised fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and pretraining, on challenging generative tasks in both language and vision domains.

Guiding Diffusion with Deep Geometric Moments: Balancing Fidelity and   Variation,"Text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable capabilities in synthesizing images, but often struggle to provide fine-grained control over the output. Existing guidance approaches, such as segmentation maps and depth maps, introduce spatial rigidity that restricts the inherent diversity of diffusion models. In this work, we introduce Deep Geometric Moments (DGM) as a novel form of guidance that encapsulates the subject's visual features and nuances through a learned geometric prior. DGMs focus specifically on the subject itself compared to DINO or CLIP features, which suffer from overemphasis on global image features or semantics. Unlike ResNets, which are sensitive to pixel-wise perturbations, DGMs rely on robust geometric moments. Our experiments demonstrate that DGM effectively balance control and diversity in diffusion-based image generation, allowing a flexible control mechanism for steering the diffusion process.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12486v1
Recollection from Pensieve: Novel View Synthesis via Learning from   Uncalibrated Videos,"Currently almost all state-of-the-art novel view synthesis and reconstruction models rely on calibrated cameras or additional geometric priors for training. These prerequisites significantly limit their applicability to massive uncalibrated data. To alleviate this requirement and unlock the potential for self-supervised training on large-scale uncalibrated videos, we propose a novel two-stage strategy to train a view synthesis model from only raw video frames or multi-view images, without providing camera parameters or other priors. In the first stage, we learn to reconstruct the scene implicitly in a latent space without relying on any explicit 3D representation. Specifically, we predict per-frame latent camera and scene context features, and employ a view synthesis model as a proxy for explicit rendering. This pretraining stage substantially reduces the optimization complexity and encourages the network to learn the underlying 3D consistency in a self-supervised manner. The learned latent camera and implicit scene representation have a large gap compared with the real 3D world. To reduce this gap, we introduce the second stage training by explicitly predicting 3D Gaussian primitives. We additionally apply explicit Gaussian Splatting rendering loss and depth projection loss to align the learned latent representations with physically grounded 3D geometry. In this way, Stage 1 provides a strong initialization and Stage 2 enforces 3D consistency - the two stages are complementary and mutually beneficial. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high-quality novel view synthesis and accurate camera pose estimation, compared to methods that employ supervision with calibration, pose, or depth information.

Enhancing Multi-Image Question Answering via Submodular Subset Selection,"Large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved high performance in vision-language tasks involving single image but they struggle when presented with a collection of multiple images (Multiple Image Question Answering scenario). These tasks, which involve reasoning over large number of images, present issues in scalability (with increasing number of images) and retrieval performance. In this work, we propose an enhancement for retriever framework introduced in MIRAGE model using submodular subset selection techniques. Our method leverages query-aware submodular functions, such as GraphCut, to pre-select a subset of semantically relevant images before main retrieval component. We demonstrate that using anchor-based queries and augmenting the data improves submodular-retriever pipeline effectiveness, particularly in large haystack sizes.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10533v1
EmotionHallucer: Evaluating Emotion Hallucinations in Multimodal Large   Language Models,"Emotion understanding is a critical yet challenging task. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities in this area. However, MLLMs often suffer from hallucinations, generating irrelevant or nonsensical content. To the best of our knowledge, despite the importance of this issue, there has been no dedicated effort to evaluate emotion-related hallucinations in MLLMs. In this work, we introduce EmotionHallucer, the first benchmark for detecting and analyzing emotion hallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike humans, whose emotion understanding stems from the interplay of biology and social learning, MLLMs rely solely on data-driven learning and lack innate emotional instincts. Fortunately, emotion psychology provides a solid foundation of knowledge about human emotions. Building on this, we assess emotion hallucinations from two dimensions: emotion psychology knowledge and real-world multimodal perception. To support robust evaluation, we utilize an adversarial binary question-answer (QA) framework, which employs carefully crafted basic and hallucinated pairs to assess the emotion hallucination tendencies of MLLMs. By evaluating 38 LLMs and MLLMs on EmotionHallucer, we reveal that: i) most current models exhibit substantial issues with emotion hallucinations; ii) closed-source models outperform open-source ones in detecting emotion hallucinations, and reasoning capability provides additional advantages; iii) existing models perform better in emotion psychology knowledge than in multimodal emotion perception. As a byproduct, these findings inspire us to propose the PEP-MEK framework, which yields an average improvement of 9.90% in emotion hallucination detection across selected models.

A Unified and Scalable Membership Inference Method for Visual   Self-supervised Encoder via Part-aware Capability,"Self-supervised learning shows promise in harnessing extensive unlabeled data, but it also confronts significant privacy concerns, especially in vision. In this paper, we perform membership inference on visual self-supervised models in a more realistic setting: self-supervised training method and details are unknown for an adversary when attacking as he usually faces a black-box system in practice. In this setting, considering that self-supervised model could be trained by completely different self-supervised paradigms, e.g., masked image modeling and contrastive learning, with complex training details, we propose a unified membership inference method called PartCrop. It is motivated by the shared part-aware capability among models and stronger part response on the training data. Specifically, PartCrop crops parts of objects in an image to query responses within the image in representation space. We conduct extensive attacks on self-supervised models with different training protocols and structures using three widely used image datasets. The results verify the effectiveness and generalization of PartCrop. Moreover, to defend against PartCrop, we evaluate two common approaches, i.e., early stop and differential privacy, and propose a tailored method called shrinking crop scale range. The defense experiments indicate that all of them are effective. Finally, besides prototype testing on toy visual encoders and small-scale image datasets, we quantitatively study the impacts of scaling from both data and model aspects in a realistic scenario and propose a scalable PartCrop-v2 by introducing two structural improvements to PartCrop. Our code is at https://github.com/JiePKU/PartCrop.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10351v1
MVAR: Visual Autoregressive Modeling with Scale and Spatial Markovian   Conditioning,"Essential to visual generation is efficient modeling of visual data priors. Conventional next-token prediction methods define the process as learning the conditional probability distribution of successive tokens. Recently, next-scale prediction methods redefine the process to learn the distribution over multi-scale representations, significantly reducing generation latency. However, these methods condition each scale on all previous scales and require each token to consider all preceding tokens, exhibiting scale and spatial redundancy. To better model the distribution by mitigating redundancy, we propose Markovian Visual AutoRegressive modeling (MVAR), a novel autoregressive framework that introduces scale and spatial Markov assumptions to reduce the complexity of conditional probability modeling. Specifically, we introduce a scale-Markov trajectory that only takes as input the features of adjacent preceding scale for next-scale prediction, enabling the adoption of a parallel training strategy that significantly reduces GPU memory consumption. Furthermore, we propose spatial-Markov attention, which restricts the attention of each token to a localized neighborhood of size k at corresponding positions on adjacent scales, rather than attending to every token across these scales, for the pursuit of reduced modeling complexity. Building on these improvements, we reduce the computational complexity of attention calculation from O(N^2) to O(Nk), enabling training with just eight NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs and eliminating the need for KV cache during inference. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that MVAR achieves comparable or superior performance with both small model trained from scratch and large fine-tuned models, while reducing the average GPU memory footprint by 3.0x.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12742v1
Visual Fidelity Index for Generative Semantic Communications with   Critical Information Embedding,"Generative semantic communication (Gen-SemCom) with large artificial intelligence (AI) model promises a transformative paradigm for 6G networks, which reduces communication costs by transmitting low-dimensional prompts rather than raw data. However, purely prompt-driven generation loses fine-grained visual details. Additionally, there is a lack of systematic metrics to evaluate the performance of Gen-SemCom systems. To address these issues, we develop a hybrid Gen-SemCom system with a critical information embedding (CIE) framework, where both text prompts and semantically critical features are extracted for transmissions. First, a novel approach of semantic filtering is proposed to select and transmit the semantically critical features of images relevant to semantic label. By integrating the text prompt and critical features, the receiver reconstructs high-fidelity images using a diffusion-based generative model. Next, we propose the generative visual information fidelity (GVIF) metric to evaluate the visual quality of the generated image. By characterizing the statistical models of image features, the GVIF metric quantifies the mutual information between the distorted features and their original counterparts. By maximizing the GVIF metric, we design a channel-adaptive Gen-SemCom system that adaptively control the volume of features and compression rate according to the channel state. Experimental results validate the GVIF metric's sensitivity to visual fidelity, correlating with both the PSNR and critical information volume. In addition, the optimized system achieves superior performance over benchmarking schemes in terms of higher PSNR and lower FID scores.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10405v1
DPCD: A Quality Assessment Database for Dynamic Point Clouds,"Recently, the advancements in Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR) have driven the demand for Dynamic Point Clouds (DPC). Unlike static point clouds, DPCs are capable of capturing temporal changes within objects or scenes, offering a more accurate simulation of the real world. While significant progress has been made in the quality assessment research of static point cloud, little study has been done on Dynamic Point Cloud Quality Assessment (DPCQA), which hinders the development of quality-oriented applications, such as interframe compression and transmission in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale DPCQA database, named DPCD, which includes 15 reference DPCs and 525 distorted DPCs from seven types of lossy compression and noise distortion. By rendering these samples to Processed Video Sequences (PVS), a comprehensive subjective experiment is conducted to obtain Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) from 21 viewers for analysis. The characteristic of contents, impact of various distortions, and accuracy of MOSs are presented to validate the heterogeneity and reliability of the proposed database. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of several objective metrics on DPCD. The experiment results show that DPCQA is more challenge than that of static point cloud. The DPCD, which serves as a catalyst for new research endeavors on DPCQA, is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Olivialyt/DPCD.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12431v1
FALCON: False-Negative Aware Learning of Contrastive Negatives in   Vision-Language Pretraining,"False negatives pose a critical challenge in vision-language pretraining (VLP) due to the many-to-many correspondence between images and texts in large-scale datasets. These false negatives introduce conflicting supervision signals that degrade the learned embedding space and diminish the effectiveness of hard negative sampling. In this paper, we propose FALCON (False-negative Aware Learning of COntrastive Negatives), a learning-based mini-batch construction strategy that adaptively balances the trade-off between hard and false negatives during VLP. Rather than relying on fixed heuristics, FALCON employs a negative mining scheduler that dynamically selects negative samples of appropriate hardness for each anchor instance during mini-batch construction, guided by a proxy for cross-modal alignment improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that FALCON significantly improves performance across two widely adopted VLP frameworks (ALBEF, BLIP-2) and a broad range of downstream tasks and evaluation settings, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in mitigating the impact of false negatives.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11192v2
Assessing the Performance of Analog Training for Transfer Learning,"Analog in-memory computing is a next-generation computing paradigm that promises fast, parallel, and energy-efficient deep learning training and transfer learning (TL). However, achieving this promise has remained elusive due to a lack of suitable training algorithms. Analog memory devices exhibit asymmetric and non-linear switching behavior in addition to device-to-device variation, meaning that most, if not all, of the current off-the-shelf training algorithms cannot achieve good training outcomes. Also, recently introduced algorithms have enjoyed limited attention, as they require bi-directionally switching devices of unrealistically high symmetry and precision and are highly sensitive. A new algorithm chopped TTv2 (c-TTv2), has been introduced, which leverages the chopped technique to address many of the challenges mentioned above. In this paper, we assess the performance of the c-TTv2 algorithm for analog TL using a Swin-ViT model on a subset of the CIFAR100 dataset. We also investigate the robustness of our algorithm to changes in some device specifications, including weight transfer noise, symmetry point skew, and symmetry point variability",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11067v1
Is Artificial Intelligence Generated Image Detection a Solved Problem?,"The rapid advancement of generative models, such as GANs and Diffusion models, has enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, raising serious concerns about misinformation, deepfakes, and copyright infringement. Although numerous Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AIGI) detectors have been proposed, often reporting high accuracy, their effectiveness in real-world scenarios remains questionable. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIGIBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the robustness and generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art AIGI detectors. AIGIBench simulates real-world challenges through four core tasks: multi-source generalization, robustness to image degradation, sensitivity to data augmentation, and impact of test-time pre-processing. It includes 23 diverse fake image subsets that span both advanced and widely adopted image generation techniques, along with real-world samples collected from social media and AI art platforms. Extensive experiments on 11 advanced detectors demonstrate that, despite their high reported accuracy in controlled settings, these detectors suffer significant performance drops on real-world data, limited benefits from common augmentations, and nuanced effects of pre-processing, highlighting the need for more robust detection strategies. By providing a unified and realistic evaluation framework, AIGIBench offers valuable insights to guide future research toward dependable and generalizable AIGI detection.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12335v1
End-to-End Vision Tokenizer Tuning,"Existing vision tokenization isolates the optimization of vision tokenizers from downstream training, implicitly assuming the visual tokens can generalize well across various tasks, e.g., image generation and visual question answering. The vision tokenizer optimized for low-level reconstruction is agnostic to downstream tasks requiring varied representations and semantics. This decoupled paradigm introduces a critical misalignment: The loss of the vision tokenization can be the representation bottleneck for target tasks. For example, errors in tokenizing text in a given image lead to poor results when recognizing or generating them. To address this, we propose ETT, an end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning approach that enables joint optimization between vision tokenization and target autoregressive tasks. Unlike prior autoregressive models that use only discrete indices from a frozen vision tokenizer, ETT leverages the visual embeddings of the tokenizer codebook, and optimizes the vision tokenizers end-to-end with both reconstruction and caption objectives. ETT can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines with minimal architecture modifications. Our ETT is simple to implement and integrate, without the need to adjust the original codebooks or architectures of the employed large language models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning unlocks significant performance gains, i.e., 2-6% for multimodal understanding and visual generation tasks compared to frozen tokenizer baselines, while preserving the original reconstruction capability. We hope this very simple and strong method can empower multimodal foundation models besides image generation and understanding.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10562v1
Human-Aligned Bench: Fine-Grained Assessment of Reasoning Ability in   MLLMs vs. Humans,"The goal of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is to imitate humans and surpass them. Models such as OpenAI's o1, o3, and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) with human-like reasoning capabilities exhibit exceptional performance and are being gradually integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, whether these models possess capabilities comparable to humans in handling reasoning tasks remains unclear at present. In this paper, we propose Human-Aligned Bench, a benchmark for fine-grained alignment of multimodal reasoning with human performance. Specifically, we collected 9,794 multimodal questions that solely rely on contextual reasoning, including bilingual (Chinese and English) multimodal questions and pure text-based questions, encompassing four question types: visual reasoning, definition judgment, analogical reasoning, and logical judgment. More importantly, each question is accompanied by human success rates and options that humans are prone to choosing incorrectly. Extensive experiments on the Human-Aligned Bench reveal notable differences between the performance of current MLLMs in multimodal reasoning and human performance. The findings on our benchmark provide insights into the development of the next-generation models.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11141v1
Denoising Mutual Knowledge Distillation in Bi-Directional Multiple   Instance Learning,"Multiple Instance Learning is the predominant method for Whole Slide Image classification in digital pathology, enabling the use of slide-level labels to supervise model training. Although MIL eliminates the tedious fine-grained annotation process for supervised learning, whether it can learn accurate bag- and instance-level classifiers remains a question. To address the issue, instance-level classifiers and instance masks were incorporated to ground the prediction on supporting patches. These methods, while practically improving the performance of MIL methods, may potentially introduce noisy labels. We propose to bridge the gap between commonly used MIL and fully supervised learning by augmenting both the bag- and instance-level learning processes with pseudo-label correction capabilities elicited from weak to strong generalization techniques. The proposed algorithm improves the performance of dual-level MIL algorithms on both bag- and instance-level predictions. Experiments on public pathology datasets showcase the advantage of the proposed methods.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12074v1
SpatialCrafter: Unleashing the Imagination of Video Diffusion Models for   Scene Reconstruction from Limited Observations,"Novel view synthesis (NVS) boosts immersive experiences in computer vision and graphics. Existing techniques, though progressed, rely on dense multi-view observations, restricting their application. This work takes on the challenge of reconstructing photorealistic 3D scenes from sparse or single-view inputs. We introduce SpatialCrafter, a framework that leverages the rich knowledge in video diffusion models to generate plausible additional observations, thereby alleviating reconstruction ambiguity. Through a trainable camera encoder and an epipolar attention mechanism for explicit geometric constraints, we achieve precise camera control and 3D consistency, further reinforced by a unified scale estimation strategy to handle scale discrepancies across datasets. Furthermore, by integrating monocular depth priors with semantic features in the video latent space, our framework directly regresses 3D Gaussian primitives and efficiently processes long-sequence features using a hybrid network structure. Extensive experiments show our method enhances sparse view reconstruction and restores the realistic appearance of 3D scenes.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11992v1
Face Consistency Benchmark for GenAI Video,"Video generation driven by artificial intelligence has advanced significantly, enabling the creation of dynamic and realistic content. However, maintaining character consistency across video sequences remains a major challenge, with current models struggling to ensure coherence in appearance and attributes. This paper introduces the Face Consistency Benchmark (FCB), a framework for evaluating and comparing the consistency of characters in AI-generated videos. By providing standardized metrics, the benchmark highlights gaps in existing solutions and promotes the development of more reliable approaches. This work represents a crucial step toward improving character consistency in AI video generation technologies.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11425v1
MTevent: A Multi-Task Event Camera Dataset for 6D Pose Estimation and   Moving Object Detection,"Mobile robots are reaching unprecedented speeds, with platforms like Unitree B2, and Fraunhofer O3dyn achieving maximum speeds between 5 and 10 m/s. However, effectively utilizing such speeds remains a challenge due to the limitations of RGB cameras, which suffer from motion blur and fail to provide real-time responsiveness. Event cameras, with their asynchronous operation, and low-latency sensing, offer a promising alternative for high-speed robotic perception. In this work, we introduce MTevent, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation and moving object detection in highly dynamic environments with large detection distances. Our setup consists of a stereo-event camera and an RGB camera, capturing 75 scenes, each on average 16 seconds, and featuring 16 unique objects under challenging conditions such as extreme viewing angles, varying lighting, and occlusions. MTevent is the first dataset to combine high-speed motion, long-range perception, and real-world object interactions, making it a valuable resource for advancing event-based vision in robotics. To establish a baseline, we evaluate the task of 6D pose estimation using NVIDIA's FoundationPose on RGB images, achieving an Average Recall of 0.22 with ground-truth masks, highlighting the limitations of RGB-based approaches in such dynamic settings. With MTevent, we provide a novel resource to improve perception models and foster further research in high-speed robotic vision. The dataset is available for download https://huggingface.co/datasets/anas-gouda/MTevent",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11282v1
Patient-Specific Autoregressive Models for Organ Motion Prediction in   Radiotherapy,"Radiotherapy often involves a prolonged treatment period. During this time, patients may experience organ motion due to breathing and other physiological factors. Predicting and modeling this motion before treatment is crucial for ensuring precise radiation delivery. However, existing pre-treatment organ motion prediction methods primarily rely on deformation analysis using principal component analysis (PCA), which is highly dependent on registration quality and struggles to capture periodic temporal dynamics for motion modeling.In this paper, we observe that organ motion prediction closely resembles an autoregressive process, a technique widely used in natural language processing (NLP). Autoregressive models predict the next token based on previous inputs, naturally aligning with our objective of predicting future organ motion phases. Building on this insight, we reformulate organ motion prediction as an autoregressive process to better capture patient-specific motion patterns. Specifically, we acquire 4D CT scans for each patient before treatment, with each sequence comprising multiple 3D CT phases. These phases are fed into the autoregressive model to predict future phases based on prior phase motion patterns. We evaluate our method on a real-world test set of 4D CT scans from 50 patients who underwent radiotherapy at our institution and a public dataset containing 4D CT scans from 20 patients (some with multiple scans), totaling over 1,300 3D CT phases. The performance in predicting the motion of the lung and heart surpasses existing benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing motion dynamics from CT images. These results highlight the potential of our method to improve pre-treatment planning in radiotherapy, enabling more precise and adaptive radiation delivery.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11832v1
Event-Driven Dynamic Scene Depth Completion,"Depth completion in dynamic scenes poses significant challenges due to rapid ego-motion and object motion, which can severely degrade the quality of input modalities such as RGB images and LiDAR measurements. Conventional RGB-D sensors often struggle to align precisely and capture reliable depth under such conditions. In contrast, event cameras with their high temporal resolution and sensitivity to motion at the pixel level provide complementary cues that are %particularly beneficial in dynamic environments.To this end, we propose EventDC, the first event-driven depth completion framework. It consists of two key components: Event-Modulated Alignment (EMA) and Local Depth Filtering (LDF). Both modules adaptively learn the two fundamental components of convolution operations: offsets and weights conditioned on motion-sensitive event streams. In the encoder, EMA leverages events to modulate the sampling positions of RGB-D features to achieve pixel redistribution for improved alignment and fusion. In the decoder, LDF refines depth estimations around moving objects by learning motion-aware masks from events. Additionally, EventDC incorporates two loss terms to further benefit global alignment and enhance local depth recovery. Moreover, we establish the first benchmark for event-based depth completion comprising one real-world and two synthetic datasets to facilitate future research. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our EventDC.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13279v1
Touch2Shape: Touch-Conditioned 3D Diffusion for Shape Exploration and   Reconstruction,"Diffusion models have made breakthroughs in 3D generation tasks. Current 3D diffusion models focus on reconstructing target shape from images or a set of partial observations. While excelling in global context understanding, they struggle to capture the local details of complex shapes and limited to the occlusion and lighting conditions. To overcome these limitations, we utilize tactile images to capture the local 3D information and propose a Touch2Shape model, which leverages a touch-conditioned diffusion model to explore and reconstruct the target shape from touch. For shape reconstruction, we have developed a touch embedding module to condition the diffusion model in creating a compact representation and a touch shape fusion module to refine the reconstructed shape. For shape exploration, we combine the diffusion model with reinforcement learning to train a policy. This involves using the generated latent vector from the diffusion model to guide the touch exploration policy training through a novel reward design. Experiments validate the reconstruction quality thorough both qualitatively and quantitative analysis, and our touch exploration policy further boosts reconstruction performance.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13091v1
Mamba-Adaptor: State Space Model Adaptor for Visual Recognition,"Recent State Space Models (SSM), especially Mamba, have demonstrated impressive performance in visual modeling and possess superior model efficiency. However, the application of Mamba to visual tasks suffers inferior performance due to three main constraints existing in the sequential model: 1) Casual computing is incapable of accessing global context; 2) Long-range forgetting when computing the current hidden states; 3) Weak spatial structural modeling due to the transformed sequential input. To address these issues, we investigate a simple yet powerful vision task Adaptor for Mamba models, which consists of two functional modules: Adaptor-T and Adaptor-S. When solving the hidden states for SSM, we apply a lightweight prediction module Adaptor-T to select a set of learnable locations as memory augmentations to ease long-range forgetting issues. Moreover, we leverage Adapator-S, composed of multi-scale dilated convolutional kernels, to enhance the spatial modeling and introduce the image inductive bias into the feature output. Both modules can enlarge the context modeling in casual computing, as the output is enhanced by the inaccessible features. We explore three usages of Mamba-Adaptor: A general visual backbone for various vision tasks; A booster module to raise the performance of pretrained backbones; A highly efficient fine-tuning module that adapts the base model for transfer learning tasks. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of Mamba-Adaptor in three settings. Notably, our Mamba-Adaptor achieves state-of the-art performance on the ImageNet and COCO benchmarks.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12685v1
X-Edit: Detecting and Localizing Edits in Images Altered by Text-Guided   Diffusion Models,"Text-guided diffusion models have significantly advanced image editing, enabling highly realistic and local modifications based on textual prompts. While these developments expand creative possibilities, their malicious use poses substantial challenges for detection of such subtle deepfake edits. To this end, we introduce Explain Edit (X-Edit), a novel method for localizing diffusion-based edits in images. To localize the edits for an image, we invert the image using a pretrained diffusion model, then use these inverted features as input to a segmentation network that explicitly predicts the edited masked regions via channel and spatial attention. Further, we finetune the model using a combined segmentation and relevance loss. The segmentation loss ensures accurate mask prediction by balancing pixel-wise errors and perceptual similarity, while the relevance loss guides the model to focus on low-frequency regions and mitigate high-frequency artifacts, enhancing the localization of subtle edits. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address and model the problem of localizing diffusion-based modified regions in images. We additionally contribute a new dataset of paired original and edited images addressing the current lack of resources for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that X-Edit accurately localizes edits in images altered by text-guided diffusion models, outperforming baselines in PSNR and SSIM metrics. This highlights X-Edit's potential as a robust forensic tool for detecting and pinpointing manipulations introduced by advanced image editing techniques.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11753v1
Beluga Whale Detection from Satellite Imagery with Point Labels,"Very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery has emerged as a powerful tool for monitoring marine animals on a large scale. However, existing deep learning-based whale detection methods usually require manually created, high-quality bounding box annotations, which are labor-intensive to produce. Moreover, existing studies often exclude ``uncertain whales'', individuals that have ambiguous appearances in satellite imagery, limiting the applicability of these models in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, this study introduces an automated pipeline for detecting beluga whales and harp seals in VHR satellite imagery. The pipeline leverages point annotations and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate precise bounding box annotations, which are used to train YOLOv8 for multiclass detection of certain whales, uncertain whales, and harp seals. Experimental results demonstrated that SAM-generated annotations significantly improved detection performance, achieving higher $\text{F}_\text{1}$-scores compared to traditional buffer-based annotations. YOLOv8 trained on SAM-labeled boxes achieved an overall $\text{F}_\text{1}$-score of 72.2% for whales overall and 70.3% for harp seals, with superior performance in dense scenes. The proposed approach not only reduces the manual effort required for annotation but also enhances the detection of uncertain whales, offering a more comprehensive solution for marine animal monitoring. This method holds great potential for extending to other species, habitats, and remote sensing platforms, as well as for estimating whale biometrics, thereby advancing ecological monitoring and conservation efforts.

Open-Source Multi-Viewpoint Surgical Telerobotics,"As robots for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) gradually become more accessible and modular, we believe there is a great opportunity to rethink and expand the visualization and control paradigms that have characterized surgical teleoperation since its inception. We conjecture that introducing one or more additional adjustable viewpoints in the abdominal cavity would not only unlock novel visualization and collaboration strategies for surgeons but also substantially boost the robustness of machine perception toward shared autonomy. Immediate advantages include controlling a second viewpoint and teleoperating surgical tools from a different perspective, which would allow collaborating surgeons to adjust their views independently and still maneuver their robotic instruments intuitively. Furthermore, we believe that capturing synchronized multi-view 3D measurements of the patient's anatomy would unlock advanced scene representations. Accurate real-time intraoperative 3D perception will allow algorithmic assistants to directly control one or more robotic instruments and/or robotic cameras. Toward these goals, we are building a synchronized multi-viewpoint, multi-sensor robotic surgery system by integrating high-performance vision components and upgrading the da Vinci Research Kit control logic. This short paper reports a functional summary of our setup and elaborates on its potential impacts in research and future clinical practice. By fully open-sourcing our system, we will enable the research community to reproduce our setup, improve it, and develop powerful algorithms, effectively boosting clinical translation of cutting-edge research.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11142v1
A Survey on the Safety and Security Threats of Computer-Using Agents:   JARVIS or Ultron?,"Recently, AI-driven interactions with computing devices have advanced from basic prototype tools to sophisticated, LLM-based systems that emulate human-like operations in graphical user interfaces. We are now witnessing the emergence of \emph{Computer-Using Agents} (CUAs), capable of autonomously performing tasks such as navigating desktop applications, web pages, and mobile apps. However, as these agents grow in capability, they also introduce novel safety and security risks. Vulnerabilities in LLM-driven reasoning, with the added complexity of integrating multiple software components and multimodal inputs, further complicate the security landscape. In this paper, we present a systematization of knowledge on the safety and security threats of CUAs. We conduct a comprehensive literature review and distill our findings along four research objectives: \textit{\textbf{(i)}} define the CUA that suits safety analysis; \textit{\textbf{(ii)} } categorize current safety threats among CUAs; \textit{\textbf{(iii)}} propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing defensive strategies; \textit{\textbf{(iv)}} summarize prevailing benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation metrics used to assess the safety and performance of CUAs.

Multi-modal Collaborative Optimization and Expansion Network for   Event-assisted Single-eye Expression Recognition,"In this paper, we proposed a Multi-modal Collaborative Optimization and Expansion Network (MCO-E Net), to use event modalities to resist challenges such as low light, high exposure, and high dynamic range in single-eye expression recognition tasks. The MCO-E Net introduces two innovative designs: Multi-modal Collaborative Optimization Mamba (MCO-Mamba) and Heterogeneous Collaborative and Expansion Mixture-of-Experts (HCE-MoE). MCO-Mamba, building upon Mamba, leverages dual-modal information to jointly optimize the model, facilitating collaborative interaction and fusion of modal semantics. This approach encourages the model to balance the learning of both modalities and harness their respective strengths. HCE-MoE, on the other hand, employs a dynamic routing mechanism to distribute structurally varied experts (deep, attention, and focal), fostering collaborative learning of complementary semantics. This heterogeneous architecture systematically integrates diverse feature extraction paradigms to comprehensively capture expression semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed network achieves competitive performance in the task of single-eye expression recognition, especially under poor lighting conditions.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12007v1
Black-box Adversaries from Latent Space: Unnoticeable Attacks on Human   Pose and Shape Estimation,"Expressive human pose and shape (EHPS) estimation is vital for digital human generation, particularly in live-streaming applications. However, most existing EHPS models focus primarily on minimizing estimation errors, with limited attention on potential security vulnerabilities. Current adversarial attacks on EHPS models often require white-box access (e.g., model details or gradients) or generate visually conspicuous perturbations, limiting their practicality and ability to expose real-world security threats. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Unnoticeable Black-Box Attack (UBA) against EHPS models. UBA leverages the latent-space representations of natural images to generate an optimal adversarial noise pattern and iteratively refine its attack potency along an optimized direction in digital space. Crucially, this process relies solely on querying the model's output, requiring no internal knowledge of the EHPS architecture, while guiding the noise optimization toward greater stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments and visual analyses demonstrate the superiority of UBA. Notably, UBA increases the pose estimation errors of EHPS models by 17.27%-58.21% on average, revealing critical vulnerabilities. These findings underscore the urgent need to address and mitigate security risks associated with digital human generation systems.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12009v1
Image-based Visibility Analysis Replacing Line-of-Sight Simulation: An   Urban Landmark Perspective,"Visibility analysis is one of the fundamental analytics methods in urban planning and landscape research, traditionally conducted through computational simulations based on the Line-of-Sight (LoS) principle. However, when assessing the visibility of named urban objects such as landmarks, geometric intersection alone fails to capture the contextual and perceptual dimensions of visibility as experienced in the real world. The study challenges the traditional LoS-based approaches by introducing a new, image-based visibility analysis method. Specifically, a Vision Language Model (VLM) is applied to detect the target object within a direction-zoomed Street View Image (SVI). Successful detection represents the object's visibility at the corresponding SVI location. Further, a heterogeneous visibility graph is constructed to address the complex interaction between observers and target objects. In the first case study, the method proves its reliability in detecting the visibility of six tall landmark constructions in global cities, with an overall accuracy of 87%. Furthermore, it reveals broader contextual differences when the landmarks are perceived and experienced. In the second case, the proposed visibility graph uncovers the form and strength of connections for multiple landmarks along the River Thames in London, as well as the places where these connections occur. Notably, bridges on the River Thames account for approximately 30% of total connections. Our method complements and enhances traditional LoS-based visibility analysis, and showcases the possibility of revealing the prevalent connection of any visual objects in the urban environment. It opens up new research perspectives for urban planning, heritage conservation, and computational social science.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11809v1
FlightGPT: Towards Generalizable and Interpretable UAV   Vision-and-Language Navigation with Vision-Language Models,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is vital for applications such as disaster response, logistics delivery, and urban inspection. However, existing methods often struggle with insufficient multimodal fusion, weak generalization, and poor interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose FlightGPT, a novel UAV VLN framework built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with powerful multimodal perception capabilities. We design a two-stage training pipeline: first, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using high-quality demonstrations to improve initialization and structured reasoning; then, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, guided by a composite reward that considers goal accuracy, reasoning quality, and format compliance, to enhance generalization and adaptability.

Are Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution Networks for Human Action   Recognition Over-Parameterized?,"Spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs) showcase impressive performance in skeleton-based human action recognition (HAR). However, despite the development of numerous models, their recognition performance does not differ significantly after aligning the input settings. With this observation, we hypothesize that ST-GCNs are over-parameterized for HAR, a conjecture subsequently confirmed through experiments employing the lottery ticket hypothesis. Additionally, a novel sparse ST-GCNs generator is proposed, which trains a sparse architecture from a randomly initialized dense network while maintaining comparable performance levels to the dense components. Moreover, we generate multi-level sparsity ST-GCNs by integrating sparse structures at various sparsity levels and demonstrate that the assembled model yields a significant enhancement in HAR performance. Thorough experiments on four datasets, including NTU-RGB+D 60(120), Kinetics-400, and FineGYM, demonstrate that the proposed sparse ST-GCNs can achieve comparable performance to their dense components. Even with 95% fewer parameters, the sparse ST-GCNs exhibit a degradation of <1% in top-1 accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-level sparsity ST-GCNs, which require only 66% of the parameters of the dense ST-GCNs, demonstrate an improvement of >1% in top-1 accuracy.

3D Visual Illusion Depth Estimation,"3D visual illusion is a perceptual phenomenon where a two-dimensional plane is manipulated to simulate three-dimensional spatial relationships, making a flat artwork or object look three-dimensional in the human visual system. In this paper, we reveal that the machine visual system is also seriously fooled by 3D visual illusions, including monocular and binocular depth estimation. In order to explore and analyze the impact of 3D visual illusion on depth estimation, we collect a large dataset containing almost 3k scenes and 200k images to train and evaluate SOTA monocular and binocular depth estimation methods. We also propose a robust depth estimation framework that uses common sense from a vision-language model to adaptively select reliable depth from binocular disparity and monocular depth. Experiments show that SOTA monocular, binocular, and multi-view depth estimation approaches are all fooled by various 3D visual illusions, while our method achieves SOTA performance.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13061v1
TACOcc:Target-Adaptive Cross-Modal Fusion with Volume Rendering for 3D   Semantic Occupancy,"The performance of multi-modal 3D occupancy prediction is limited by ineffective fusion, mainly due to geometry-semantics mismatch from fixed fusion strategies and surface detail loss caused by sparse, noisy annotations. The mismatch stems from the heterogeneous scale and distribution of point cloud and image features, leading to biased matching under fixed neighborhood fusion. To address this, we propose a target-scale adaptive, bidirectional symmetric retrieval mechanism. It expands the neighborhood for large targets to enhance context awareness and shrinks it for small ones to improve efficiency and suppress noise, enabling accurate cross-modal feature alignment. This mechanism explicitly establishes spatial correspondences and improves fusion accuracy. For surface detail loss, sparse labels provide limited supervision, resulting in poor predictions for small objects. We introduce an improved volume rendering pipeline based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which takes fused features as input to render images, applies photometric consistency supervision, and jointly optimizes 2D-3D consistency. This enhances surface detail reconstruction while suppressing noise propagation. In summary, we propose TACOcc, an adaptive multi-modal fusion framework for 3D semantic occupancy prediction, enhanced by volume rendering supervision. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks validate its effectiveness.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12693v1
DexGarmentLab: Dexterous Garment Manipulation Environment with   Generalizable Policy,"Garment manipulation is a critical challenge due to the diversity in garment categories, geometries, and deformations. Despite this, humans can effortlessly handle garments, thanks to the dexterity of our hands. However, existing research in the field has struggled to replicate this level of dexterity, primarily hindered by the lack of realistic simulations of dexterous garment manipulation. Therefore, we propose DexGarmentLab, the first environment specifically designed for dexterous (especially bimanual) garment manipulation, which features large-scale high-quality 3D assets for 15 task scenarios, and refines simulation techniques tailored for garment modeling to reduce the sim-to-real gap. Previous data collection typically relies on teleoperation or training expert reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are labor-intensive and inefficient. In this paper, we leverage garment structural correspondence to automatically generate a dataset with diverse trajectories using only a single expert demonstration, significantly reducing manual intervention. However, even extensive demonstrations cannot cover the infinite states of garments, which necessitates the exploration of new algorithms. To improve generalization across diverse garment shapes and deformations, we propose a Hierarchical gArment-manipuLation pOlicy (HALO). It first identifies transferable affordance points to accurately locate the manipulation area, then generates generalizable trajectories to complete the task. Through extensive experiments and detailed analysis of our method and baseline, we demonstrate that HALO consistently outperforms existing methods, successfully generalizing to previously unseen instances even with significant variations in shape and deformation where others fail.

PMQ-VE: Progressive Multi-Frame Quantization for Video Enhancement,"Multi-frame video enhancement tasks aim to improve the spatial and temporal resolution and quality of video sequences by leveraging temporal information from multiple frames, which are widely used in streaming video processing, surveillance, and generation. Although numerous Transformer-based enhancement methods have achieved impressive performance, their computational and memory demands hinder deployment on edge devices. Quantization offers a practical solution by reducing the bit-width of weights and activations to improve efficiency. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to video enhancement tasks often leads to significant performance degradation and loss of fine details. This stems from two limitations: (a) inability to allocate varying representational capacity across frames, which results in suboptimal dynamic range adaptation; (b) over-reliance on full-precision teachers, which limits the learning of low-bit student models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel quantization method for video enhancement: Progressive Multi-Frame Quantization for Video Enhancement (PMQ-VE). This framework features a coarse-to-fine two-stage process: Backtracking-based Multi-Frame Quantization (BMFQ) and Progressive Multi-Teacher Distillation (PMTD). BMFQ utilizes a percentile-based initialization and iterative search with pruning and backtracking for robust clipping bounds. PMTD employs a progressive distillation strategy with both full-precision and multiple high-bit (INT) teachers to enhance low-bit models' capacity and quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks and benchmarks.The code will be made publicly available at: https://github.com/xiaoBIGfeng/PMQ-VE.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12266v1
Mitigate Language Priors in Large Vision-Language Models by Cross-Images   Contrastive Decoding,"Language priors are a major cause of hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), often leading to text that is linguistically plausible but visually inconsistent. Recent work explores contrastive decoding as a training-free solution, but these methods typically construct negative visual contexts from the original image, resulting in visual information loss and distorted distribution. Motivated by the observation that language priors stem from the LLM backbone and remain consistent across images, we propose Cross-Images Contrastive Decoding (CICD), a simple yet effective training-free method that uses different images to construct negative visual contexts. We further analyze the cross-image behavior of language priors and introduce a distinction between essential priors (supporting fluency) and detrimental priors (causing hallucinations), enabling selective suppression. By selectively preserving essential priors and suppressing detrimental ones, our method reduces hallucinations while maintaining coherent and fluent language generation. Experiments on four benchmarks and six LVLMs across three model families confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of CICD, especially in image captioning, where language priors are particularly pronounced. Code will be released upon acceptance.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10634v2
3D-Fixup: Advancing Photo Editing with 3D Priors,"Despite significant advances in modeling image priors via diffusion models, 3D-aware image editing remains challenging, in part because the object is only specified via a single image. To tackle this challenge, we propose 3D-Fixup, a new framework for editing 2D images guided by learned 3D priors. The framework supports difficult editing situations such as object translation and 3D rotation. To achieve this, we leverage a training-based approach that harnesses the generative power of diffusion models. As video data naturally encodes real-world physical dynamics, we turn to video data for generating training data pairs, i.e., a source and a target frame. Rather than relying solely on a single trained model to infer transformations between source and target frames, we incorporate 3D guidance from an Image-to-3D model, which bridges this challenging task by explicitly projecting 2D information into 3D space. We design a data generation pipeline to ensure high-quality 3D guidance throughout training. Results show that by integrating these 3D priors, 3D-Fixup effectively supports complex, identity coherent 3D-aware edits, achieving high-quality results and advancing the application of diffusion models in realistic image manipulation.

Semantically-Aware Game Image Quality Assessment,"Assessing the visual quality of video game graphics presents unique challenges due to the absence of reference images and the distinct types of distortions, such as aliasing, texture blur, and geometry level of detail (LOD) issues, which differ from those in natural images or user-generated content. Existing no-reference image and video quality assessment (NR-IQA/VQA) methods fail to generalize to gaming environments as they are primarily designed for distortions like compression artifacts. This study introduces a semantically-aware NR-IQA model tailored to gaming. The model employs a knowledge-distilled Game distortion feature extractor (GDFE) to detect and quantify game-specific distortions, while integrating semantic gating via CLIP embeddings to dynamically weight feature importance based on scene content. Training on gameplay data recorded across graphical quality presets enables the model to produce quality scores that align with human perception. Our results demonstrate that the GDFE, trained through knowledge distillation from binary classifiers, generalizes effectively to intermediate distortion levels unseen during training. Semantic gating further improves contextual relevance and reduces prediction variance. In the absence of in-domain NR-IQA baselines, our model outperforms out-of-domain methods and exhibits robust, monotonic quality trends across unseen games in the same genre. This work establishes a foundation for automated graphical quality assessment in gaming, advancing NR-IQA methods in this domain.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11724v1
Diff-MM: Exploring Pre-trained Text-to-Image Generation Model for   Unified Multi-modal Object Tracking,"Multi-modal object tracking integrates auxiliary modalities such as depth, thermal infrared, event flow, and language to provide additional information beyond RGB images, showing great potential in improving tracking stabilization in complex scenarios. Existing methods typically start from an RGB-based tracker and learn to understand auxiliary modalities only from training data. Constrained by the limited multi-modal training data, the performance of these methods is unsatisfactory. To alleviate this limitation, this work proposes a unified multi-modal tracker Diff-MM by exploiting the multi-modal understanding capability of the pre-trained text-to-image generation model. Diff-MM leverages the UNet of pre-trained Stable Diffusion as a tracking feature extractor through the proposed parallel feature extraction pipeline, which enables pairwise image inputs for object tracking. We further introduce a multi-modal sub-module tuning method that learns to gain complementary information between different modalities. By harnessing the extensive prior knowledge in the generation model, we achieve a unified tracker with uniform parameters for RGB-N/D/T/E tracking. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of our method compared with recently proposed trackers, e.g., its AUC outperforms OneTracker by 8.3% on TNL2K.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12606v1
Robust Cross-View Geo-Localization via Content-Viewpoint Disentanglement,"Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same geographic location captured from different perspectives, such as drones and satellites. Despite recent advances, CVGL remains highly challenging due to significant appearance changes and spatial distortions caused by viewpoint variations. Existing methods typically assume that cross-view images can be directly aligned within a shared feature space by maximizing feature similarity through contrastive learning. Nonetheless, this assumption overlooks the inherent conflicts induced by viewpoint discrepancies, resulting in extracted features containing inconsistent information that hinders precise localization. In this study, we take a manifold learning perspective and model the feature space of cross-view images as a composite manifold jointly governed by content and viewpoint information. Building upon this insight, we propose $\textbf{CVD}$, a new CVGL framework that explicitly disentangles $\textit{content}$ and $\textit{viewpoint}$ factors. To promote effective disentanglement, we introduce two constraints: $\textit{(i)}$ An intra-view independence constraint, which encourages statistical independence between the two factors by minimizing their mutual information. $\textit{(ii)}$ An inter-view reconstruction constraint that reconstructs each view by cross-combining $\textit{content}$ and $\textit{viewpoint}$ from paired images, ensuring factor-specific semantics are preserved. As a plug-and-play module, CVD can be seamlessly integrated into existing geo-localization pipelines. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks, i.e., University-1652, SUES-200, CVUSA, and CVACT, demonstrate that CVD consistently improves both localization accuracy and generalization across multiple baselines.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11822v1
Self-NPO: Negative Preference Optimization of Diffusion Models by Simply   Learning from Itself without Explicit Preference Annotations,"Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various visual generation tasks, including image, video, and 3D content generation. Preference optimization (PO) is a prominent and growing area of research that aims to align these models with human preferences. While existing PO methods primarily concentrate on producing favorable outputs, they often overlook the significance of classifier-free guidance (CFG) in mitigating undesirable results. Diffusion-NPO addresses this gap by introducing negative preference optimization (NPO), training models to generate outputs opposite to human preferences and thereby steering them away from unfavorable outcomes. However, prior NPO approaches, including Diffusion-NPO, rely on costly and fragile procedures for obtaining explicit preference annotations (e.g., manual pairwise labeling or reward model training), limiting their practicality in domains where such data are scarce or difficult to acquire. In this work, we introduce Self-NPO, a Negative Preference Optimization approach that learns exclusively from the model itself, thereby eliminating the need for manual data labeling or reward model training. Moreover, our method is highly efficient and does not require exhaustive data sampling. We demonstrate that Self-NPO integrates seamlessly into widely used diffusion models, including SD1.5, SDXL, and CogVideoX, as well as models already optimized for human preferences, consistently enhancing both their generation quality and alignment with human preferences.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11777v1
Self-Learning Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Fusion via Adaptive   Residual Guided Subspace Diffusion Model,"Hyperspectral and multispectral image (HSI-MSI) fusion involves combining a low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) with a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) to generate a high-resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI). Most deep learning-based methods for HSI-MSI fusion rely on large amounts of hyperspectral data for supervised training, which is often scarce in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a self-learning Adaptive Residual Guided Subspace Diffusion Model (ARGS-Diff), which only utilizes the observed images without any extra training data. Specifically, as the LR-HSI contains spectral information and the HR-MSI contains spatial information, we design two lightweight spectral and spatial diffusion models to separately learn the spectral and spatial distributions from them. Then, we use these two models to reconstruct HR-HSI from two low-dimensional components, i.e, the spectral basis and the reduced coefficient, during the reverse diffusion process. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Residual Guided Module (ARGM), which refines the two components through a residual guided function at each sampling step, thereby stabilizing the sampling process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ARGS-Diff outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both performance and computational efficiency in the field of HSI-MSI fusion.

Vision language models have difficulty recognizing virtual objects,"Vision language models (VLMs) are AI systems paired with both language and vision encoders to process multimodal input. They are capable of performing complex semantic tasks such as automatic captioning, but it remains an open question about how well they comprehend the visuospatial properties of scenes depicted in the images they process. We argue that descriptions of virtual objects -- objects that are not visually represented in an image -- can help test scene comprehension in these AI systems. For example, an image that depicts a person standing under a tree can be paired with the following prompt: imagine that a kite is stuck in the tree. VLMs that comprehend the scene should update their representations and reason sensibly about the spatial relations between all three objects. We describe systematic evaluations of state-of-the-art VLMs and show that their ability to process virtual objects is inadequate.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10453v1
Rebalancing Contrastive Alignment with Learnable Semantic Gaps in   Text-Video Retrieval,"Recent advances in text-video retrieval have been largely driven by contrastive learning frameworks. However, existing methods overlook a key source of optimization tension: the separation between text and video distributions in the representation space (referred to as the modality gap), and the prevalence of false negatives in batch sampling. These factors lead to conflicting gradients under the InfoNCE loss, impeding stable alignment. To mitigate this, we propose GARE, a Gap-Aware Retrieval framework that introduces a learnable, pair-specific increment Delta_ij between text t_i and video v_j to offload the tension from the global anchor representation. We first derive the ideal form of Delta_ij via a coupled multivariate first-order Taylor approximation of the InfoNCE loss under a trust-region constraint, revealing it as a mechanism for resolving gradient conflicts by guiding updates along a locally optimal descent direction. Due to the high cost of directly computing Delta_ij, we introduce a lightweight neural module conditioned on the semantic gap between each video-text pair, enabling structure-aware correction guided by gradient supervision. To further stabilize learning and promote interpretability, we regularize Delta using three components: a trust-region constraint to prevent oscillation, a directional diversity term to promote semantic coverage, and an information bottleneck to limit redundancy. Experiments across four retrieval benchmarks show that GARE consistently improves alignment accuracy and robustness to noisy supervision, confirming the effectiveness of gap-aware tension mitigation.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12499v1
IA-MVS: Instance-Focused Adaptive Depth Sampling for Multi-View Stereo,"Multi-view stereo (MVS) models based on progressive depth hypothesis narrowing have made remarkable advancements. However, existing methods haven't fully utilized the potential that the depth coverage of individual instances is smaller than that of the entire scene, which restricts further improvements in depth estimation precision. Moreover, inevitable deviations in the initial stage accumulate as the process advances. In this paper, we propose Instance-Adaptive MVS (IA-MVS). It enhances the precision of depth estimation by narrowing the depth hypothesis range and conducting refinement on each instance. Additionally, a filtering mechanism based on intra-instance depth continuity priors is incorporated to boost robustness. Furthermore, recognizing that existing confidence estimation can degrade IA-MVS performance on point clouds. We have developed a detailed mathematical model for confidence estimation based on conditional probability. The proposed method can be widely applied in models based on MVSNet without imposing extra training burdens. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU benchmark. The source code is available at https://github.com/KevinWang73106/IA-MVS.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12714v1
StoryReasoning Dataset: Using Chain-of-Thought for Scene Understanding   and Grounded Story Generation,"Visual storytelling systems struggle to maintain character identity across frames and link actions to appropriate subjects, frequently leading to referential hallucinations. These issues can be addressed through grounding of characters, objects, and other entities on the visual elements. We propose StoryReasoning, a dataset containing 4,178 stories derived from 52,016 movie images, with both structured scene analyses and grounded stories. Each story maintains character and object consistency across frames while explicitly modeling multi-frame relationships through structured tabular representations. Our approach features cross-frame object re-identification using visual similarity and face recognition, chain-of-thought reasoning for explicit narrative modeling, and a grounding scheme that links textual elements to visual entities across multiple frames. We establish baseline performance by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL 7B, creating Qwen Storyteller, which performs end-to-end object detection, re-identification, and landmark detection while maintaining consistent object references throughout the story. Evaluation demonstrates a reduction from 4.06 to 3.56 (-12.3%) hallucinations on average per story when compared to a non-fine-tuned model.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10292v1
Multi-contrast laser endoscopy for in vivo gastrointestinal imaging,"White light endoscopy is the clinical gold standard for detecting diseases in the gastrointestinal tract. Most applications involve identifying visual abnormalities in tissue color, texture, and shape. Unfortunately, the contrast of these features is often subtle, causing many clinically relevant cases to go undetected. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Multi-contrast Laser Endoscopy (MLE): a platform for widefield clinical imaging with rapidly tunable spectral, coherent, and directional illumination. We demonstrate three capabilities of MLE: enhancing tissue chromophore contrast with multispectral diffuse reflectance, quantifying blood flow using laser speckle contrast imaging, and characterizing mucosal topography using photometric stereo. We validate MLE with benchtop models, then demonstrate MLE in vivo during clinical colonoscopies. MLE images from 31 polyps demonstrate an approximate three-fold improvement in contrast and a five-fold improvement in color difference compared to white light and narrow band imaging. With the ability to reveal multiple complementary types of tissue contrast while seamlessly integrating into the clinical environment, MLE shows promise as an investigative tool to improve gastrointestinal imaging.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10492v1
IMAGE-ALCHEMY: Advancing subject fidelity in personalised text-to-image   generation,"Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion, have enabled the generation of highly detailed and semantically rich images. However, personalizing these models to represent novel subjects based on a few reference images remains challenging. This often leads to catastrophic forgetting, overfitting, or large computational overhead.We propose a two-stage pipeline that addresses these limitations by leveraging LoRA-based fine-tuning on the attention weights within the U-Net of the Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) model. First, we use the unmodified SDXL to generate a generic scene by replacing the subject with its class label. Then, we selectively insert the personalized subject through a segmentation-driven image-to-image (Img2Img) pipeline that uses the trained LoRA weights.This framework isolates the subject encoding from the overall composition, thus preserving SDXL's broader generative capabilities while integrating the new subject in a high-fidelity manner. Our method achieves a DINO similarity score of 0.789 on SDXL, outperforming existing personalized text-to-image approaches.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10743v1
Breaking the Batch Barrier (B3) of Contrastive Learning via Smart Batch   Mining,"Contrastive learning (CL) is a prevalent technique for training embedding models, which pulls semantically similar examples (positives) closer in the representation space while pushing dissimilar ones (negatives) further apart. A key source of negatives are 'in-batch' examples, i.e., positives from other examples in the batch. Effectiveness of such models is hence strongly influenced by the size and quality of training batches. In this work, we propose 'Breaking the Batch Barrier' (B3), a novel batch construction strategy designed to curate high-quality batches for CL. Our approach begins by using a pretrained teacher embedding model to rank all examples in the dataset, from which a sparse similarity graph is constructed. A community detection algorithm is then applied to this graph to identify clusters of examples that serve as strong negatives for one another. The clusters are then used to construct batches that are rich in in-batch negatives. Empirical results on the MMEB multimodal embedding benchmark (36 tasks) demonstrate that our method sets a new state of the art, outperforming previous best methods by +1.3 and +2.9 points at the 7B and 2B model scales, respectively. Notably, models trained with B3 surpass existing state-of-the-art results even with a batch size as small as 64, which is 4-16x smaller than that required by other methods.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11293v1
Enhancing Diffusion-Weighted Images (DWI) for Diffusion MRI: Is it   Enough without Non-Diffusion-Weighted B=0 Reference?,"Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is essential for studying brain microstructure, but high-resolution imaging remains challenging due to the inherent trade-offs between acquisition time and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Conventional methods often optimize only the diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) without considering their relationship with the non-diffusion-weighted (b=0) reference images. However, calculating diffusion metrics, such as the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and diffusion tensor with its derived metrics like fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), relies on the ratio between each DWI and the b=0 image, which is crucial for clinical observation and diagnostics. In this study, we demonstrate that solely enhancing DWIs using a conventional pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss is insufficient, as the error in ratio between generated DWIs and b=0 diverges. We propose a novel ratio loss, defined as the MSE loss between the predicted and ground-truth log of DWI/b=0 ratios. Our results show that incorporating the ratio loss significantly improves the convergence of this ratio error, achieving lower ratio MSE and slightly enhancing the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of generated DWIs. This leads to improved dMRI super-resolution and better preservation of b=0 ratio-based features for the derivation of diffusion metrics.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12978v1
"MIRACL-VISION: A Large, multilingual, visual document retrieval   benchmark","Document retrieval is an important task for search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have contributed to improving the accuracy of text-based document retrieval. However, documents with complex layout and visual elements like tables, charts and infographics are not perfectly represented in textual format. Recently, image-based document retrieval pipelines have become popular, which use visual large language models (VLMs) to retrieve relevant page images given a query. Current evaluation benchmarks on visual document retrieval are limited, as they primarily focus only English language, rely on synthetically generated questions and offer a small corpus size. Therefore, we introduce MIRACL-VISION, a multilingual visual document retrieval evaluation benchmark. MIRACL-VISION covers 18 languages, and is an extension of the MIRACL dataset, a popular benchmark to evaluate text-based multilingual retrieval pipelines. MIRACL was built using a human-intensive annotation process to generate high-quality questions. In order to reduce MIRACL-VISION corpus size to make evaluation more compute friendly while keeping the datasets challenging, we have designed a method for eliminating the ""easy"" negatives from the corpus. We conducted extensive experiments comparing MIRACL-VISION with other benchmarks, using popular public text and image models. We observe a gap in state-of-the-art VLM-based embedding models on multilingual capabilities, with up to 59.7% lower retrieval accuracy than a text-based retrieval models. Even for the English language, the visual models retrieval accuracy is 12.1% lower compared to text-based models. MIRACL-VISION is a challenging, representative, multilingual evaluation benchmark for visual retrieval pipelines and will help the community build robust models for document retrieval.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11651v1
SpatialLLM: From Multi-modality Data to Urban Spatial Intelligence,"We propose SpatialLLM, a novel approach advancing spatial intelligence tasks in complex urban scenes. Unlike previous methods requiring geographic analysis tools or domain expertise, SpatialLLM is a unified language model directly addressing various spatial intelligence tasks without any training, fine-tuning, or expert intervention. The core of SpatialLLM lies in constructing detailed and structured scene descriptions from raw spatial data to prompt pre-trained LLMs for scene-based analysis. Extensive experiments show that, with our designs, pretrained LLMs can accurately perceive spatial distribution information and enable zero-shot execution of advanced spatial intelligence tasks, including urban planning, ecological analysis, traffic management, etc. We argue that multi-field knowledge, context length, and reasoning ability are key factors influencing LLM performances in urban analysis. We hope that SpatialLLM will provide a novel viable perspective for urban intelligent analysis and management.

A High-Performance Thermal Infrared Object Detection Framework with   Centralized Regulation,"Thermal Infrared (TIR) technology involves the use of sensors to detect and measure infrared radiation emitted by objects, and it is widely utilized across a broad spectrum of applications. The advancements in object detection methods utilizing TIR images have sparked significant research interest. However, most traditional methods lack the capability to effectively extract and fuse local-global information, which is crucial for TIR-domain feature attention. In this study, we present a novel and efficient thermal infrared object detection framework, known as CRT-YOLO, that is based on centralized feature regulation, enabling the establishment of global-range interaction on TIR information. Our proposed model integrates efficient multi-scale attention (EMA) modules, which adeptly capture long-range dependencies while incurring minimal computational overhead. Additionally, it leverages the Centralized Feature Pyramid (CFP) network, which offers global regulation of TIR features. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CRT-YOLO model significantly outperforms conventional methods for TIR image object detection. Furthermore, the ablation study provides compelling evidence of the effectiveness of our proposed modules, reinforcing the potential impact of our approach on advancing the field of thermal infrared object detection.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10825v1
Coarse Attribute Prediction with Task Agnostic Distillation for Real   World Clothes Changing ReID,"This work focuses on Clothes Changing Re-IDentification (CC-ReID) for the real world. Existing works perform well with high-quality (HQ) images, but struggle with low-quality (LQ) where we can have artifacts like pixelation, out-of-focus blur, and motion blur. These artifacts introduce noise to not only external biometric attributes (e.g. pose, body shape, etc.) but also corrupt the model's internal feature representation. Models usually cluster LQ image features together, making it difficult to distinguish between them, leading to incorrect matches. We propose a novel framework Robustness against Low-Quality (RLQ) to improve CC-ReID model on real-world data. RLQ relies on Coarse Attributes Prediction (CAP) and Task Agnostic Distillation (TAD) operating in alternate steps in a novel training mechanism. CAP enriches the model with external fine-grained attributes via coarse predictions, thereby reducing the effect of noisy inputs. On the other hand, TAD enhances the model's internal feature representation by bridging the gap between HQ and LQ features, via an external dataset through task-agnostic self-supervision and distillation. RLQ outperforms the existing approaches by 1.6%-2.9% Top-1 on real-world datasets like LaST, and DeepChange, while showing consistent improvement of 5.3%-6% Top-1 on PRCC with competitive performance on LTCC. *The code will be made public soon.*",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12580v1
Uniformity First: Uniformity-aware Test-time Adaptation of   Vision-language Models against Image Corruption,"Pre-trained vision-language models such as contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) have demonstrated a remarkable generalizability, which has enabled a wide range of applications represented by zero-shot classification. However, vision-language models still suffer when they face datasets with large gaps from training ones, i.e., distribution shifts. We found that CLIP is especially vulnerable to sensor degradation, a type of realistic distribution shift caused by sensor conditions such as weather, light, or noise. Collecting a new dataset from a test distribution for fine-tuning highly costs since sensor degradation occurs unexpectedly and has a range of variety. Thus, we investigate test-time adaptation (TTA) of zero-shot classification, which enables on-the-fly adaptation to the test distribution with unlabeled test data. Existing TTA methods for CLIP mainly focus on modifying image and text embeddings or predictions to address distribution shifts. Although these methods can adapt to domain shifts, such as fine-grained labels spaces or different renditions in input images, they fail to adapt to distribution shifts caused by sensor degradation. We found that this is because image embeddings are ""corrupted"" in terms of uniformity, a measure related to the amount of information. To make models robust to sensor degradation, we propose a novel method called uniformity-aware information-balanced TTA (UnInfo). To address the corruption of image embeddings, we introduce uniformity-aware confidence maximization, information-aware loss balancing, and knowledge distillation from the exponential moving average (EMA) teacher. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our UnInfo improves accuracy under sensor degradation by retaining information in terms of uniformity.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12912v1
FlowCut: Unsupervised Video Instance Segmentation via Temporal Mask   Matching,"We propose FlowCut, a simple and capable method for unsupervised video instance segmentation consisting of a three-stage framework to construct a high-quality video dataset with pseudo labels. To our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to curate a video dataset with pseudo-labels for unsupervised video instance segmentation. In the first stage, we generate pseudo-instance masks by exploiting the affinities of features from both images and optical flows. In the second stage, we construct short video segments containing high-quality, consistent pseudo-instance masks by temporally matching them across the frames. In the third stage, we use the YouTubeVIS-2021 video dataset to extract our training instance segmentation set, and then train a video segmentation model. FlowCut achieves state-of-the-art performance on the YouTubeVIS-2019, YouTubeVIS-2021, DAVIS-2017, and DAVIS-2017 Motion benchmarks.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13174v1
SurveillanceVQA-589K: A Benchmark for Comprehensive Surveillance   Video-Language Understanding with Large Models,"Understanding surveillance video content remains a critical yet underexplored challenge in vision-language research, particularly due to its real-world complexity, irregular event dynamics, and safety-critical implications. In this work, we introduce SurveillanceVQA-589K, the largest open-ended video question answering benchmark tailored to the surveillance domain. The dataset comprises 589,380 QA pairs spanning 12 cognitively diverse question types, including temporal reasoning, causal inference, spatial understanding, and anomaly interpretation, across both normal and abnormal video scenarios. To construct the benchmark at scale, we design a hybrid annotation pipeline that combines temporally aligned human-written captions with Large Vision-Language Model-assisted QA generation using prompt-based techniques. We also propose a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol to assess contextual, temporal, and causal comprehension. We evaluate eight LVLMs under this framework, revealing significant performance gaps, especially in causal and anomaly-related tasks, underscoring the limitations of current models in real-world surveillance contexts. Our benchmark provides a practical and comprehensive resource for advancing video-language understanding in safety-critical applications such as intelligent monitoring, incident analysis, and autonomous decision-making.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12589v1
MedVKAN: Efficient Feature Extraction with Mamba and KAN for Medical   Image Segmentation,"Medical image segmentation relies heavily on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models. However, CNNs are constrained by limited receptive fields, while Transformers suffer from scalability challenges due to their quadratic computational complexity. To address these limitations, recent advances have explored alternative architectures. The state-space model Mamba offers near-linear complexity while capturing long-range dependencies, and the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) enhances nonlinear expressiveness by replacing fixed activation functions with learnable ones. Building on these strengths, we propose MedVKAN, an efficient feature extraction model integrating Mamba and KAN. Specifically, we introduce the EFC-KAN module, which enhances KAN with convolutional operations to improve local pixel interaction. We further design the VKAN module, integrating Mamba with EFC-KAN as a replacement for Transformer modules, significantly improving feature extraction. Extensive experiments on five public medical image segmentation datasets show that MedVKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets and ranks second on the remaining one. These results validate the potential of Mamba and KAN for medical image segmentation while introducing an innovative and computationally efficient feature extraction framework. The code is available at: https://github.com/beginner-cjh/MedVKAN.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11797v1
GuidedMorph: Two-Stage Deformable Registration for Breast MRI,"Accurately registering breast MR images from different time points enables the alignment of anatomical structures and tracking of tumor progression, supporting more effective breast cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment planning. However, the complexity of dense tissue and its highly non-rigid nature pose challenges for conventional registration methods, which primarily focus on aligning general structures while overlooking intricate internal details. To address this, we propose \textbf{GuidedMorph}, a novel two-stage registration framework designed to better align dense tissue. In addition to a single-scale network for global structure alignment, we introduce a framework that utilizes dense tissue information to track breast movement. The learned transformation fields are fused by introducing the Dual Spatial Transformer Network (DSTN), improving overall alignment accuracy. A novel warping method based on the Euclidean distance transform (EDT) is also proposed to accurately warp the registered dense tissue and breast masks, preserving fine structural details during deformation. The framework supports paradigms that require external segmentation models and with image data only. It also operates effectively with the VoxelMorph and TransMorph backbones, offering a versatile solution for breast registration. We validate our method on ISPY2 and internal dataset, demonstrating superior performance in dense tissue, overall breast alignment, and breast structural similarity index measure (SSIM), with notable improvements by over 13.01% in dense tissue Dice, 3.13% in breast Dice, and 1.21% in breast SSIM compared to the best learning-based baseline.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13414v1
Does Feasibility Matter? Understanding the Impact of Feasibility on   Synthetic Training Data,"With the development of photorealistic diffusion models, models trained in part or fully on synthetic data achieve progressively better results. However, diffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in reality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture artifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a synthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic images containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered infeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered out-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a model's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be excluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility really matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is necessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers, focusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We introduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to include feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated by a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally affects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference in top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets. Also, the attribute matters on whether the feasible/infeasible images adversarially influence the classification performance. Finally, mixing feasible and infeasible images in training datasets does not significantly impact performance compared to using purely feasible or infeasible datasets.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10551v1
Expert-Like Reparameterization of Heterogeneous Pyramid Receptive Fields   in Efficient CNNs for Fair Medical Image Classification,"Efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designs have attracted growing research interests. However, they usually apply single receptive field (RF), small asymmetric RFs, or pyramid RFs to learn different feature representations, still encountering two significant challenges in medical image classification tasks: 1) They have limitations in capturing diverse lesion characteristics efficiently, e.g., tiny, coordination, small and salient, which have unique roles on results, especially imbalanced medical image classification. 2) The predictions generated by those CNNs are often unfair/biased, bringing a high risk by employing them to real-world medical diagnosis conditions. To tackle these issues, we develop a new concept, Expert-Like Reparameterization of Heterogeneous Pyramid Receptive Fields (ERoHPRF), to simultaneously boost medical image classification performance and fairness. This concept aims to mimic the multi-expert consultation mode by applying the well-designed heterogeneous pyramid RF bags to capture different lesion characteristics effectively via convolution operations with multiple heterogeneous kernel sizes. Additionally, ERoHPRF introduces an expert-like structural reparameterization technique to merge its parameters with the two-stage strategy, ensuring competitive computation cost and inference speed through comparisons to a single RF. To manifest the effectiveness and generalization ability of ERoHPRF, we incorporate it into mainstream efficient CNN architectures. The extensive experiments show that our method maintains a better trade-off than state-of-the-art methods in terms of medical image classification, fairness, and computation overhead. The codes of this paper will be released soon.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13039v1
Multimodal Event Detection: Current Approaches and Defining the New   Playground through LLMs and VLMs,"In this paper, we study the challenges of detecting events on social media, where traditional unimodal systems struggle due to the rapid and multimodal nature of data dissemination. We employ a range of models, including unimodal ModernBERT and ConvNeXt-V2, multimodal fusion techniques, and advanced generative models like GPT-4o, and LLaVA. Additionally, we also study the effect of providing multimodal generative models (such as GPT-4o) with a single modality to assess their efficacy. Our results indicate that while multimodal approaches notably outperform unimodal counterparts, generative approaches despite having a large number of parameters, lag behind supervised methods in precision. Furthermore, we also found that they lag behind instruction-tuned models because of their inability to generate event classes correctly. During our error analysis, we discovered that common social media issues such as leet speak, text elongation, etc. are effectively handled by generative approaches but are hard to tackle using supervised approaches.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10836v1
A probabilistic framework for dynamic quantization,"We propose a probabilistic framework for dynamic quantization of neural networks that allows for a computationally efficient input-adaptive rescaling of the quantization parameters. Our framework applies a probabilistic model to the network's pre-activations through a lightweight surrogate, enabling the adaptive adjustment of the quantization parameters on a per-input basis without significant memory overhead. We validate our approach on a set of popular computer vision tasks and models, observing only a negligible loss in performance. Our method strikes the best performance and computational overhead tradeoff compared to standard quantization strategies.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10689v1
"CheXGenBench: A Unified Benchmark For Fidelity, Privacy and Utility of   Synthetic Chest Radiographs","We introduce CheXGenBench, a rigorous and multifaceted evaluation framework for synthetic chest radiograph generation that simultaneously assesses fidelity, privacy risks, and clinical utility across state-of-the-art text-to-image generative models. Despite rapid advancements in generative AI for real-world imagery, medical domain evaluations have been hindered by methodological inconsistencies, outdated architectural comparisons, and disconnected assessment criteria that rarely address the practical clinical value of synthetic samples. CheXGenBench overcomes these limitations through standardised data partitioning and a unified evaluation protocol comprising over 20 quantitative metrics that systematically analyse generation quality, potential privacy vulnerabilities, and downstream clinical applicability across 11 leading text-to-image architectures. Our results reveal critical inefficiencies in the existing evaluation protocols, particularly in assessing generative fidelity, leading to inconsistent and uninformative comparisons. Our framework establishes a standardised benchmark for the medical AI community, enabling objective and reproducible comparisons while facilitating seamless integration of both existing and future generative models. Additionally, we release a high-quality, synthetic dataset, SynthCheX-75K, comprising 75K radiographs generated by the top-performing model (Sana 0.6B) in our benchmark to support further research in this critical domain. Through CheXGenBench, we establish a new state-of-the-art and release our framework, models, and SynthCheX-75K dataset at https://raman1121.github.io/CheXGenBench/",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10496v1
MARRS: Masked Autoregressive Unit-based Reaction Synthesis,"This work aims at a challenging task: human action-reaction synthesis, i.e., generating human reactions based on the action sequence of the other as conditions. Currently, autoregressive modeling approaches have achieved remarkable performance in motion generation tasks, e.g. text-to-motion. However, vector quantization (VQ) accompanying autoregressive generation has inherent disadvantages, including loss of quantization information, low codebook utilization, etc. Moreover, unlike text-to-motion, which focuses solely on the movement of body joints, human action-reaction synthesis also encompasses fine-grained hand movements. In this work, we propose MARRS, a novel framework designed to generate coordinated and fine-grained reaction motions in continuous representations. Initially, we present the Unit-distinguished Motion Variational AutoEncoder (UD-VAE), which segments the entire body into distinct body and hand units, encoding them independently. Subsequently, we propose Action-Conditioned Fusion (ACF), which involves randomly masking a subset of reactive tokens and extracting specific information about the body and hands from the active tokens. Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive Unit Modulation (AUM) to facilitate interaction between body and hand units by using the information from one unit to adaptively modulate the other. Finally, for the diffusion model, we employ a compact MLP as a noise predictor for each distinct body unit and incorporate the diffusion loss to model the probability distribution of each token. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance. The code will be released upon acceptance.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11334v1
MIPHEI-ViT: Multiplex Immunofluorescence Prediction from H&E Images   using ViT Foundation Models,"Histopathological analysis is a cornerstone of cancer diagnosis, with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining routinely acquired for every patient to visualize cell morphology and tissue architecture. On the other hand, multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) enables more precise cell type identification via proteomic markers, but has yet to achieve widespread clinical adoption due to cost and logistical constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce MIPHEI (Multiplex Immunofluorescence Prediction from H&E), a U-Net-inspired architecture that integrates state-of-the-art ViT foundation models as encoders to predict mIF signals from H&E images. MIPHEI targets a comprehensive panel of markers spanning nuclear content, immune lineages (T cells, B cells, myeloid), epithelium, stroma, vasculature, and proliferation. We train our model using the publicly available ORION dataset of restained H&E and mIF images from colorectal cancer tissue, and validate it on two independent datasets. MIPHEI achieves accurate cell-type classification from H&E alone, with F1 scores of 0.88 for Pan-CK, 0.57 for CD3e, 0.56 for SMA, 0.36 for CD68, and 0.30 for CD20, substantially outperforming both a state-of-the-art baseline and a random classifier for most markers. Our results indicate that our model effectively captures the complex relationships between nuclear morphologies in their tissue context, as visible in H&E images and molecular markers defining specific cell types. MIPHEI offers a promising step toward enabling cell-type-aware analysis of large-scale H&E datasets, in view of uncovering relationships between spatial cellular organization and patient outcomes.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10294v1
Patient-Specific Dynamic Digital-Physical Twin for Coronary Intervention   Training: An Integrated Mixed Reality Approach,"Background and Objective: Precise preoperative planning and effective physician training for coronary interventions are increasingly important. Despite advances in medical imaging technologies, transforming static or limited dynamic imaging data into comprehensive dynamic cardiac models remains challenging. Existing training systems lack accurate simulation of cardiac physiological dynamics. This study develops a comprehensive dynamic cardiac model research framework based on 4D-CTA, integrating digital twin technology, computer vision, and physical model manufacturing to provide precise, personalized tools for interventional cardiology. Methods: Using 4D-CTA data from a 60-year-old female with three-vessel coronary stenosis, we segmented cardiac chambers and coronary arteries, constructed dynamic models, and implemented skeletal skinning weight computation to simulate vessel deformation across 20 cardiac phases. Transparent vascular physical models were manufactured using medical-grade silicone. We developed cardiac output analysis and virtual angiography systems, implemented guidewire 3D reconstruction using binocular stereo vision, and evaluated the system through angiography validation and CABG training applications. Results: Morphological consistency between virtual and real angiography reached 80.9%. Dice similarity coefficients for guidewire motion ranged from 0.741-0.812, with mean trajectory errors below 1.1 mm. The transparent model demonstrated advantages in CABG training, allowing direct visualization while simulating beating heart challenges. Conclusion: Our patient-specific digital-physical twin approach effectively reproduces both anatomical structures and dynamic characteristics of coronary vasculature, offering a dynamic environment with visual and tactile feedback valuable for education and clinical planning.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10902v1
Hybrid 3D-4D Gaussian Splatting for Fast Dynamic Scene Representation,"Recent advancements in dynamic 3D scene reconstruction have shown promising results, enabling high-fidelity 3D novel view synthesis with improved temporal consistency. Among these, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) has emerged as an appealing approach due to its ability to model high-fidelity spatial and temporal variations. However, existing methods suffer from substantial computational and memory overhead due to the redundant allocation of 4D Gaussians to static regions, which can also degrade image quality. In this work, we introduce hybrid 3D-4D Gaussian Splatting (3D-4DGS), a novel framework that adaptively represents static regions with 3D Gaussians while reserving 4D Gaussians for dynamic elements. Our method begins with a fully 4D Gaussian representation and iteratively converts temporally invariant Gaussians into 3D, significantly reducing the number of parameters and improving computational efficiency. Meanwhile, dynamic Gaussians retain their full 4D representation, capturing complex motions with high fidelity. Our approach achieves significantly faster training times compared to baseline 4D Gaussian Splatting methods while maintaining or improving the visual quality.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13215v1
Long-RVOS: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Long-term Referring Video   Object Segmentation,"Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to identify, track and segment the objects in a video based on language descriptions, which has received great attention in recent years. However, existing datasets remain focus on short video clips within several seconds, with salient objects visible in most frames. To advance the task towards more practical scenarios, we introduce \textbf{Long-RVOS}, a large-scale benchmark for long-term referring video object segmentation. Long-RVOS contains 2,000+ videos of an average duration exceeding 60 seconds, covering a variety of objects that undergo occlusion, disappearance-reappearance and shot changing. The objects are manually annotated with three different types of descriptions to individually evaluate the understanding of static attributes, motion patterns and spatiotemporal relationships. Moreover, unlike previous benchmarks that rely solely on the per-frame spatial evaluation, we introduce two new metrics to assess the temporal and spatiotemporal consistency. We benchmark 6 state-of-the-art methods on Long-RVOS. The results show that current approaches struggle severely with the long-video challenges. To address this, we further propose ReferMo, a promising baseline method that integrates motion information to expand the temporal receptive field, and employs a local-to-global architecture to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term dependencies. Despite simplicity, ReferMo achieves significant improvements over current methods in long-term scenarios. We hope that Long-RVOS and our baseline can drive future RVOS research towards tackling more realistic and long-form videos.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12702v1
KinTwin: Imitation Learning with Torque and Muscle Driven Biomechanical   Models Enables Precise Replication of Able-Bodied and Impaired Movement from   Markerless Motion Capture,"Broader access to high-quality movement analysis could greatly benefit movement science and rehabilitation, such as allowing more detailed characterization of movement impairments and responses to interventions, or even enabling early detection of new neurological conditions or fall risk. While emerging technologies are making it easier to capture kinematics with biomechanical models, or how joint angles change over time, inferring the underlying physics that give rise to these movements, including ground reaction forces, joint torques, or even muscle activations, is still challenging. Here we explore whether imitation learning applied to a biomechanical model from a large dataset of movements from able-bodied and impaired individuals can learn to compute these inverse dynamics. Although imitation learning in human pose estimation has seen great interest in recent years, our work differences in several ways: we focus on using an accurate biomechanical model instead of models adopted for computer vision, we test it on a dataset that contains participants with impaired movements, we reported detailed tracking metrics relevant for the clinical measurement of movement including joint angles and ground contact events, and finally we apply imitation learning to a muscle-driven neuromusculoskeletal model. We show that our imitation learning policy, KinTwin, can accurately replicate the kinematics of a wide range of movements, including those with assistive devices or therapist assistance, and that it can infer clinically meaningful differences in joint torques and muscle activations. Our work demonstrates the potential for using imitation learning to enable high-quality movement analysis in clinical practice.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13436v1
GIE-Bench: Towards Grounded Evaluation for Text-Guided Image Editing,"Editing images using natural language instructions has become a natural and expressive way to modify visual content; yet, evaluating the performance of such models remains challenging. Existing evaluation approaches often rely on image-text similarity metrics like CLIP, which lack precision. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark designed to evaluate text-guided image editing models in a more grounded manner, along two critical dimensions: (i) functional correctness, assessed via automatically generated multiple-choice questions that verify whether the intended change was successfully applied; and (ii) image content preservation, which ensures that non-targeted regions of the image remain visually consistent using an object-aware masking technique and preservation scoring. The benchmark includes over 1000 high-quality editing examples across 20 diverse content categories, each annotated with detailed editing instructions, evaluation questions, and spatial object masks. We conduct a large-scale study comparing GPT-Image-1, the latest flagship in the text-guided image editing space, against several state-of-the-art editing models, and validate our automatic metrics against human ratings. Results show that GPT-Image-1 leads in instruction-following accuracy, but often over-modifies irrelevant image regions, highlighting a key trade-off in the current model behavior. GIE-Bench provides a scalable, reproducible framework for advancing more accurate evaluation of text-guided image editing.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11493v1
SEPT: Standard-Definition Map Enhanced Scene Perception and Topology   Reasoning for Autonomous Driving,"Online scene perception and topology reasoning are critical for autonomous vehicles to understand their driving environments, particularly for mapless driving systems that endeavor to reduce reliance on costly High-Definition (HD) maps. However, recent advances in online scene understanding still face limitations, especially in long-range or occluded scenarios, due to the inherent constraints of onboard sensors. To address this challenge, we propose a Standard-Definition (SD) Map Enhanced scene Perception and Topology reasoning (SEPT) framework, which explores how to effectively incorporate the SD map as prior knowledge into existing perception and reasoning pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a novel hybrid feature fusion strategy that combines SD maps with Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, considering both rasterized and vectorized representations, while mitigating potential misalignment between SD maps and BEV feature spaces. Additionally, we leverage the SD map characteristics to design an auxiliary intersection-aware keypoint detection task, which further enhances the overall scene understanding performance. Experimental results on the large-scale OpenLane-V2 dataset demonstrate that by effectively integrating SD map priors, our framework significantly improves both scene perception and topology reasoning, outperforming existing methods by a substantial margin.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12246v1
Artifacts of Idiosyncracy in Global Street View Data,"Street view data is increasingly being used in computer vision applications in recent years. Machine learning datasets are collected for these applications using simple sampling techniques. These datasets are assumed to be a systematic representation of cities, especially when densely sampled. Prior works however, show that there are clear gaps in coverage, with certain cities or regions being covered poorly or not at all. Here we demonstrate that a cities' idiosyncracies, such as city layout, may lead to biases in street view data for 28 cities across the globe, even when they are densely covered. We quantitatively uncover biases in the distribution of coverage of street view data and propose a method for evaluation of such distributions to get better insight in idiosyncracies in a cities' coverage. In addition, we perform a case study of Amsterdam with semi-structured interviews, showing how idiosyncracies of the collection process impact representation of cities and regions and allowing us to address biases at their source.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11046v1
CLIP-aware Domain-Adaptive Super-Resolution,"This work introduces CLIP-aware Domain-Adaptive Super-Resolution (CDASR), a novel framework that addresses the critical challenge of domain generalization in single image super-resolution. By leveraging the semantic capabilities of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), CDASR achieves unprecedented performance across diverse domains and extreme scaling factors. The proposed method integrates CLIP-guided feature alignment mechanism with a meta-learning inspired few-shot adaptation strategy, enabling efficient knowledge transfer and rapid adaptation to target domains. A custom domain-adaptive module processes CLIP features alongside super-resolution features through a multi-stage transformation process, including CLIP feature processing, spatial feature generation, and feature fusion. This intricate process ensures effective incorporation of semantic information into the super-resolution pipeline. Additionally, CDASR employs a multi-component loss function that combines pixel-wise reconstruction, perceptual similarity, and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate CDASR's superiority, particularly in challenging scenarios. On the Urban100 dataset at $\times$8 scaling, CDASR achieves a significant PSNR gain of 0.15dB over existing methods, with even larger improvements of up to 0.30dB observed at $\times$16 scaling.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12391v1
Video-SafetyBench: A Benchmark for Safety Evaluation of Video LVLMs,"The increasing deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) raises safety concerns under potential malicious inputs. However, existing multimodal safety evaluations primarily focus on model vulnerabilities exposed by static image inputs, ignoring the temporal dynamics of video that may induce distinct safety risks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-SafetyBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LVLMs under video-text attacks. It comprises 2,264 video-text pairs spanning 48 fine-grained unsafe categories, each pairing a synthesized video with either a harmful query, which contains explicit malice, or a benign query, which appears harmless but triggers harmful behavior when interpreted alongside the video. To generate semantically accurate videos for safety evaluation, we design a controllable pipeline that decomposes video semantics into subject images (what is shown) and motion text (how it moves), which jointly guide the synthesis of query-relevant videos. To effectively evaluate uncertain or borderline harmful outputs, we propose RJScore, a novel LLM-based metric that incorporates the confidence of judge models and human-aligned decision threshold calibration. Extensive experiments show that benign-query video composition achieves average attack success rates of 67.2%, revealing consistent vulnerabilities to video-induced attacks. We believe Video-SafetyBench will catalyze future research into video-based safety evaluation and defense strategies.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11842v1
Learning Dense Hand Contact Estimation from Imbalanced Data,"Hands are essential to human interaction, and understanding contact between hands and the world can promote comprehensive understanding of their function. Recently, there have been growing number of hand interaction datasets that cover interaction with object, other hand, scene, and body. Despite the significance of the task and increasing high-quality data, how to effectively learn dense hand contact estimation remains largely underexplored. There are two major challenges for learning dense hand contact estimation. First, there exists class imbalance issue from hand contact datasets where majority of samples are not in contact. Second, hand contact datasets contain spatial imbalance issue with most of hand contact exhibited in finger tips, resulting in challenges for generalization towards contacts in other hand regions. To tackle these issues, we present a framework that learns dense HAnd COntact estimation (HACO) from imbalanced data. To resolve the class imbalance issue, we introduce balanced contact sampling, which builds and samples from multiple sampling groups that fairly represent diverse contact statistics for both contact and non-contact samples. Moreover, to address the spatial imbalance issue, we propose vertex-level class-balanced (VCB) loss, which incorporates spatially varying contact distribution by separately reweighting loss contribution of each vertex based on its contact frequency across dataset. As a result, we effectively learn to predict dense hand contact estimation with large-scale hand contact data without suffering from class and spatial imbalance issue. The codes will be released.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11152v1
QVGen: Pushing the Limit of Quantized Video Generative Models,"Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis. Yet, their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution, quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($\Phi$) to mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $\Phi$, we propose a rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $\Phi$. Specifically, we repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based regularization $\mathbf{\gamma}$ to identify and decay low-contributing components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out inference overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs, with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3$B $\sim14$B, show that QVGen is the first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings. Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our 3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and $+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11497v1
Higher fidelity perceptual image and video compression with a latent   conditioned residual denoising diffusion model,"Denoising diffusion models achieved impressive results on several image generation tasks often outperforming GAN based models. Recently, the generative capabilities of diffusion models have been employed for perceptual image compression, such as in CDC. A major drawback of these diffusion-based methods is that, while producing impressive perceptual quality images they are dropping in fidelity/increasing the distortion to the original uncompressed images when compared with other traditional or learned image compression schemes aiming for fidelity. In this paper, we propose a hybrid compression scheme optimized for perceptual quality, extending the approach of the CDC model with a decoder network in order to reduce the impact on distortion metrics such as PSNR. After using the decoder network to generate an initial image, optimized for distortion, the latent conditioned diffusion model refines the reconstruction for perceptual quality by predicting the residual. On standard benchmarks, we achieve up to +2dB PSNR fidelity improvements while maintaining comparable LPIPS and FID perceptual scores when compared with CDC. Additionally, the approach is easily extensible to video compression, where we achieve similar results.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13152v1
MorphGuard: Morph Specific Margin Loss for Enhancing Robustness to Face   Morphing Attacks,"Face recognition has evolved significantly with the advancement of deep learning techniques, enabling its widespread adoption in various applications requiring secure authentication. However, this progress has also increased its exposure to presentation attacks, including face morphing, which poses a serious security threat by allowing one identity to impersonate another. Therefore, modern face recognition systems must be robust against such attacks.   In this work, we propose a novel approach for training deep networks for face recognition with enhanced robustness to face morphing attacks. Our method modifies the classification task by introducing a dual-branch classification strategy that effectively handles the ambiguity in the labeling of face morphs. This adaptation allows the model to incorporate morph images into the training process, improving its ability to distinguish them from bona fide samples.   Our strategy has been validated on public benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing robustness against face morphing attacks. Furthermore, our approach is universally applicable and can be integrated into existing face recognition training pipelines to improve classification-based recognition methods.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10497v1
BusterX: MLLM-Powered AI-Generated Video Forgery Detection and   Explanation,"Advances in AI generative models facilitate super-realistic video synthesis, amplifying misinformation risks via social media and eroding trust in digital content. Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12620v1
SEAL: Searching Expandable Architectures for Incremental Learning,"Incremental learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model learns from a sequential stream of tasks. This setting poses a key challenge: balancing plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (preserving past knowledge). Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a branch of AutoML, automates the design of the architecture of Deep Neural Networks and has shown success in static settings. However, existing NAS-based approaches to incremental learning often rely on expanding the model at every task, making them impractical in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we introduce SEAL, a NAS-based framework tailored for data-incremental learning, a scenario where disjoint data samples arrive sequentially and are not stored for future access. SEAL adapts the model structure dynamically by expanding it only when necessary, based on a capacity estimation metric. Stability is preserved through cross-distillation training after each expansion step. The NAS component jointly searches for both the architecture and the optimal expansion policy. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SEAL effectively reduces forgetting and enhances accuracy while maintaining a lower model size compared to prior methods. These results highlight the promise of combining NAS and selective expansion for efficient, adaptive learning in incremental scenarios.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10457v1
CleanPatrick: A Benchmark for Image Data Cleaning,"Robust machine learning depends on clean data, yet current image data cleaning benchmarks rely on synthetic noise or narrow human studies, limiting comparison and real-world relevance. We introduce CleanPatrick, the first large-scale benchmark for data cleaning in the image domain, built upon the publicly available Fitzpatrick17k dermatology dataset. We collect 496,377 binary annotations from 933 medical crowd workers, identify off-topic samples (4%), near-duplicates (21%), and label errors (22%), and employ an aggregation model inspired by item-response theory followed by expert review to derive high-quality ground truth. CleanPatrick formalizes issue detection as a ranking task and adopts typical ranking metrics mirroring real audit workflows. Benchmarking classical anomaly detectors, perceptual hashing, SSIM, Confident Learning, NoiseRank, and SelfClean, we find that, on CleanPatrick, self-supervised representations excel at near-duplicate detection, classical methods achieve competitive off-topic detection under constrained review budgets, and label-error detection remains an open challenge for fine-grained medical classification. By releasing both the dataset and the evaluation framework, CleanPatrick enables a systematic comparison of image-cleaning strategies and paves the way for more reliable data-centric artificial intelligence.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11034v1
DragLoRA: Online Optimization of LoRA Adapters for Drag-based Image   Editing in Diffusion Model,"Drag-based editing within pretrained diffusion model provides a precise and flexible way to manipulate foreground objects. Traditional methods optimize the input feature obtained from DDIM inversion directly, adjusting them iteratively to guide handle points towards target locations. However, these approaches often suffer from limited accuracy due to the low representation ability of the feature in motion supervision, as well as inefficiencies caused by the large search space required for point tracking. To address these limitations, we present DragLoRA, a novel framework that integrates LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters into the drag-based editing pipeline. To enhance the training of LoRA adapters, we introduce an additional denoising score distillation loss which regularizes the online model by aligning its output with that of the original model. Additionally, we improve the consistency of motion supervision by adapting the input features using the updated LoRA, giving a more stable and accurate input feature for subsequent operations. Building on this, we design an adaptive optimization scheme that dynamically toggles between two modes, prioritizing efficiency without compromising precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DragLoRA significantly enhances the control precision and computational efficiency for drag-based image editing. The Codes of DragLoRA are available at: https://github.com/Sylvie-X/DragLoRA.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12427v1
NeuSEditor: From Multi-View Images to Text-Guided Neural Surface Edits,"Implicit surface representations are valued for their compactness and continuity, but they pose significant challenges for editing. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to preserve identity and maintain geometric consistency during editing. To address these challenges, we present NeuSEditor, a novel method for text-guided editing of neural implicit surfaces derived from multi-view images. NeuSEditor introduces an identity-preserving architecture that efficiently separates scenes into foreground and background, enabling precise modifications without altering the scene-specific elements. Our geometry-aware distillation loss significantly enhances rendering and geometric quality. Our method simplifies the editing workflow by eliminating the need for continuous dataset updates and source prompting. NeuSEditor outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods like PDS and InstructNeRF2NeRF, delivering superior quantitative and qualitative results.

DPSeg: Dual-Prompt Cost Volume Learning for Open-Vocabulary Semantic   Segmentation,"Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to segment images into distinct semantic regions for both seen and unseen categories at the pixel level. Current methods utilize text embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP but struggle with the inherent domain gap between image and text embeddings, even after extensive alignment during training. Additionally, relying solely on deep text-aligned features limits shallow-level feature guidance, which is crucial for detecting small objects and fine details, ultimately reducing segmentation accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a dual prompting framework, DPSeg, for this task. Our approach combines dual-prompt cost volume generation, a cost volume-guided decoder, and a semantic-guided prompt refinement strategy that leverages our dual prompting scheme to mitigate alignment issues in visual prompt generation. By incorporating visual embeddings from a visual prompt encoder, our approach reduces the domain gap between text and image embeddings while providing multi-level guidance through shallow features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on multiple public datasets.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11676v1
CROC: Evaluating and Training T2I Metrics with Pseudo- and Human-Labeled   Contrastive Robustness Checks,"The assessment of evaluation metrics (meta-evaluation) is crucial for determining the suitability of existing metrics in text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. Human-based meta-evaluation is costly and time-intensive, and automated alternatives are scarce. We address this gap and propose CROC: a scalable framework for automated Contrastive Robustness Checks that systematically probes and quantifies metric robustness by synthesizing contrastive test cases across a comprehensive taxonomy of image properties. With CROC, we generate a pseudo-labeled dataset (CROC$^{syn}$) of over one million contrastive prompt-image pairs to enable a fine-grained comparison of evaluation metrics. We also use the dataset to train CROCScore, a new metric that achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods, demonstrating an additional key application of our framework. To complement this dataset, we introduce a human-supervised benchmark (CROC$^{hum}$) targeting especially challenging categories. Our results highlight robustness issues in existing metrics: for example, many fail on prompts involving negation, and all tested open-source metrics fail on at least 25% of cases involving correct identification of body parts.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11314v1
Towards a Universal Image Degradation Model via Content-Degradation   Disentanglement,"Image degradation synthesis is highly desirable in a wide variety of applications ranging from image restoration to simulating artistic effects. Existing models are designed to generate one specific or a narrow set of degradations, which often require user-provided degradation parameters. As a result, they lack the generalizability to synthesize degradations beyond their initial design or adapt to other applications. Here we propose the first universal degradation model that can synthesize a broad spectrum of complex and realistic degradations containing both homogeneous (global) and inhomogeneous (spatially varying) components. Our model automatically extracts and disentangles homogeneous and inhomogeneous degradation features, which are later used for degradation synthesis without user intervention. A disentangle-by-compression method is proposed to separate degradation information from images. Two novel modules for extracting and incorporating inhomogeneous degradations are created to model inhomogeneous components in complex degradations. We demonstrate the model's accuracy and adaptability in film-grain simulation and blind image restoration tasks. The demo video, code, and dataset of this project will be released upon publication at github.com/yangwenbo99/content-degradation-disentanglement.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12860v1
RVTBench: A Benchmark for Visual Reasoning Tasks,"Visual reasoning, the capability to interpret visual input in response to implicit text query through multi-step reasoning, remains a challenge for deep learning models due to the lack of relevant benchmarks. Previous work in visual reasoning has primarily focused on reasoning segmentation, where models aim to segment objects based on implicit text queries. This paper introduces reasoning visual tasks (RVTs), a unified formulation that extends beyond traditional video reasoning segmentation to a diverse family of visual language reasoning problems, which can therefore accommodate multiple output formats including bounding boxes, natural language descriptions, and question-answer pairs. Correspondingly, we identify the limitations in current benchmark construction methods that rely solely on large language models (LLMs), which inadequately capture complex spatial-temporal relationships and multi-step reasoning chains in video due to their reliance on token representation, resulting in benchmarks with artificially limited reasoning complexity. To address this limitation, we propose a novel automated RVT benchmark construction pipeline that leverages digital twin (DT) representations as structured intermediaries between perception and the generation of implicit text queries. Based on this method, we construct RVTBench, a RVT benchmark containing 3,896 queries of over 1.2 million tokens across four types of RVT (segmentation, grounding, VQA and summary), three reasoning categories (semantic, spatial, and temporal), and four increasing difficulty levels, derived from 200 video sequences. Finally, we propose RVTagent, an agent framework for RVT that allows for zero-shot generalization across various types of RVT without task-specific fine-tuning.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11838v1
MutualNeRF: Improve the Performance of NeRF under Limited Samples with   Mutual Information Theory,"This paper introduces MutualNeRF, a framework enhancing Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) performance under limited samples using Mutual Information Theory. While NeRF excels in 3D scene synthesis, challenges arise with limited data and existing methods that aim to introduce prior knowledge lack theoretical support in a unified framework. We introduce a simple but theoretically robust concept, Mutual Information, as a metric to uniformly measure the correlation between images, considering both macro (semantic) and micro (pixel) levels.   For sparse view sampling, we strategically select additional viewpoints containing more non-overlapping scene information by minimizing mutual information without knowing ground truth images beforehand. Our framework employs a greedy algorithm, offering a near-optimal solution.   For few-shot view synthesis, we maximize the mutual information between inferred images and ground truth, expecting inferred images to gain more relevant information from known images. This is achieved by incorporating efficient, plug-and-play regularization terms.   Experiments under limited samples show consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in different settings, affirming the efficacy of our framework.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11386v1
Are Multimodal Large Language Models Ready for Omnidirectional Spatial   Reasoning?,"The 180x360 omnidirectional field of view captured by 360-degree cameras enables their use in a wide range of applications such as embodied AI and virtual reality. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in visual-spatial reasoning, most studies focus on standard pinhole-view images, leaving omnidirectional perception largely unexplored. In this paper, we ask: Are MLLMs ready for omnidirectional spatial reasoning? To investigate this, we introduce OSR-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed for this setting. OSR-Bench includes over 153,000 diverse question-answer pairs grounded in high-fidelity panoramic indoor scene maps. It covers key reasoning types including object counting, relative distance, and direction. We also propose a negative sampling strategy that inserts non-existent objects into prompts to evaluate hallucination and grounding robustness. For fine-grained analysis, we design a two-stage evaluation framework assessing both cognitive map generation and QA accuracy using rotation-invariant matching and a combination of rule-based and LLM-based metrics. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and leading open-source models under zero-shot settings. Results show that current models struggle with spatial reasoning in panoramic contexts, highlighting the need for more perceptually grounded MLLMs. OSR-Bench and code will be released at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/UUUserna/OSR-Bench",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11907v1
MASSV: Multimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative   Decoding of Vision-Language Models,"Speculative decoding significantly accelerates language model inference by enabling a lightweight draft model to propose multiple tokens that a larger target model verifies simultaneously. However, applying this technique to vision-language models (VLMs) presents two fundamental challenges: small language models that could serve as efficient drafters lack the architectural components to process visual inputs, and their token predictions fail to match those of VLM target models that consider visual context. We introduce Multimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative Decoding of Vision-Language Models (MASSV), which transforms existing small language models into effective multimodal drafters through a two-phase approach. MASSV first connects the target VLM's vision encoder to the draft model via a lightweight trainable projector, then applies self-distilled visual instruction tuning using responses generated by the target VLM to align token predictions. Comprehensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma3 model families demonstrate that MASSV increases accepted length by up to 30% and delivers end-to-end inference speedups of up to 1.46x on visually-grounded tasks. MASSV provides a scalable, architecture-compatible method for accelerating both current and future VLMs.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10526v2
MultiLink: Multi-class Structure Recovery via Agglomerative Clustering   and Model Selection,"We address the problem of recovering multiple structures of different classes in a dataset contaminated by noise and outliers. In particular, we consider geometric structures defined by a mixture of underlying parametric models (e.g. planes and cylinders, homographies and fundamental matrices), and we tackle the robust fitting problem by preference analysis and clustering. We present a new algorithm, termed MultiLink, that simultaneously deals with multiple classes of models. MultiLink combines on-the-fly model fitting and model selection in a novel linkage scheme that determines whether two clusters are to be merged. The resulting method features many practical advantages with respect to methods based on preference analysis, being faster, less sensitive to the inlier threshold, and able to compensate limitations deriving from hypotheses sampling. Experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that Multi-Link favourably compares with state of the art alternatives, both in multi-class and single-class problems. Code is publicly made available for download.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10874v1
Towards Self-Improvement of Diffusion Models via Group Preference   Optimization,"Aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown notable improvements in generation quality. However, applying DPO to T2I faces two challenges: the sensitivity of DPO to preference pairs and the labor-intensive process of collecting and annotating high-quality data. In this work, we demonstrate that preference pairs with marginal differences can degrade DPO performance. Since DPO relies exclusively on relative ranking while disregarding the absolute difference of pairs, it may misclassify losing samples as wins, or vice versa. We empirically show that extending the DPO from pairwise to groupwise and incorporating reward standardization for reweighting leads to performance gains without explicit data selection. Furthermore, we propose Group Preference Optimization (GPO), an effective self-improvement method that enhances performance by leveraging the model's own capabilities without requiring external data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPO is effective across various diffusion models and tasks. Specifically, combining with widely used computer vision models, such as YOLO and OCR, the GPO improves the accurate counting and text rendering capabilities of the Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium by 20 percentage points. Notably, as a plug-and-play method, no extra overhead is introduced during inference.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11070v1
BandRC: Band Shifted Raised Cosine Activated Implicit Neural   Representations,"In recent years, implicit neural representations(INRs) have gained popularity in the computer vision community. This is mainly due to the strong performance of INRs in many computer vision tasks. These networks can extract a continuous signal representation given a discrete signal representation. In previous studies, it has been repeatedly shown that INR performance has a strong correlation with the activation functions used in its multilayer perceptrons. Although numerous activation functions have been proposed that are competitive with one another, they share some common set of challenges such as spectral bias(Lack of sensitivity to high-frequency content in signals), limited robustness to signal noise and difficulties in simultaneous capturing both local and global features. and furthermore, the requirement for manual parameter tuning. To address these issues, we introduce a novel activation function, Band Shifted Raised Cosine Activated Implicit Neural Networks \textbf{(BandRC)} tailored to enhance signal representation capacity further. We also incorporate deep prior knowledge extracted from the signal to adjust the activation functions through a task-specific model. Through a mathematical analysis and a series of experiments which include image reconstruction (with a +8.93 dB PSNR improvement over the nearest counterpart), denoising (with a +0.46 dB increase in PSNR), super-resolution (with a +1.03 dB improvement over the nearest State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) method for 6X super-resolution), inpainting, and 3D shape reconstruction we demonstrate the dominance of BandRC over existing state of the art activation functions.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11640v1
Maximizing Asynchronicity in Event-based Neural Networks,"Event cameras deliver visual data with high temporal resolution, low latency, and minimal redundancy, yet their asynchronous, sparse sequential nature challenges standard tensor-based machine learning (ML). While the recent asynchronous-to-synchronous (A2S) paradigm aims to bridge this gap by asynchronously encoding events into learned representations for ML pipelines, existing A2S approaches often sacrifice representation expressivity and generalizability compared to dense, synchronous methods. This paper introduces EVA (EVent Asynchronous representation learning), a novel A2S framework to generate highly expressive and generalizable event-by-event representations. Inspired by the analogy between events and language, EVA uniquely adapts advances from language modeling in linear attention and self-supervised learning for its construction. In demonstration, EVA outperforms prior A2S methods on recognition tasks (DVS128-Gesture and N-Cars), and represents the first A2S framework to successfully master demanding detection tasks, achieving a remarkable 47.7 mAP on the Gen1 dataset. These results underscore EVA's transformative potential for advancing real-time event-based vision applications.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11165v1
Unlocking the Potential of Difficulty Prior in RL-based Multimodal   Reasoning,"In this work, we investigate how explicitly modeling problem's difficulty prior information shapes the effectiveness of reinforcement learning based fine-tuning for multimodal reasoning. Our exploration mainly comprises of following three perspective: First, through offline data curation, we analyze the U-shaped difficulty distribution of two given datasets using the base model by multi-round sampling, and then filter out prompts that are either too simple or extremely difficult to provide meaningful gradients and perform subsequent two-stage training. Second, we implement an online advantage differentiation, computing group-wise empirical accuracy as a difficulty proxy to adaptively reweight advantages estimation, providing stronger learning signals for more challenging problems. Finally, we introduce difficulty hints as explicit prompts for more complex samples in the second training stage, encouraging the model to calibrate its reasoning depth and perform reflective validation checks. Our comprehensive approach demonstrates significant performances across various multi-modal mathematical reasoning benchmarks with only 2K+0.6K two-stage training data.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13261v1
"A generalisable head MRI defacing pipeline: Evaluation on 2,566   meningioma scans","Reliable MRI defacing techniques to safeguard patient privacy while preserving brain anatomy are critical for research collaboration. Existing methods often struggle with incomplete defacing or degradation of brain tissue regions. We present a robust, generalisable defacing pipeline for high-resolution MRI that integrates atlas-based registration with brain masking. Our method was evaluated on 2,566 heterogeneous clinical scans for meningioma and achieved a 99.92 per cent success rate (2,564/2,566) upon visual inspection. Excellent anatomical preservation is demonstrated with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.9975 plus or minus 0.0023 between brain masks automatically extracted from the original and defaced volumes.

LoFT: LoRA-fused Training Dataset Generation with Few-shot Guidance,"Despite recent advances in text-to-image generation, using synthetically generated data seldom brings a significant boost in performance for supervised learning. Oftentimes, synthetic datasets do not faithfully recreate the data distribution of real data, i.e., they lack the fidelity or diversity needed for effective downstream model training. While previous work has employed few-shot guidance to address this issue, existing methods still fail to capture and generate features unique to specific real images. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset generation framework named LoFT, LoRA-Fused Training-data Generation with Few-shot Guidance. Our method fine-tunes LoRA weights on individual real images and fuses them at inference time, producing synthetic images that combine the features of real images for improved diversity and fidelity of generated data. We evaluate the synthetic data produced by LoFT on 10 datasets, using 8 to 64 real images per class as guidance and scaling up to 1000 images per class. Our experiments show that training on LoFT-generated data consistently outperforms other synthetic dataset methods, significantly increasing accuracy as the dataset size increases. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates that LoFT generates datasets with high fidelity and sufficient diversity, which contribute to the performance improvement. The code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/LoFT.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11703v1
ROIsGAN: A Region Guided Generative Adversarial Framework for Murine   Hippocampal Subregion Segmentation,"The hippocampus, a critical brain structure involved in memory processing and various neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, comprises three key subregions: the dentate gyrus (DG), Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1), and Cornu Ammonis 3 (CA3). Accurate segmentation of these subregions from histological tissue images is essential for advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms, developmental dynamics, and therapeutic interventions. However, no existing methods address the automated segmentation of hippocampal subregions from tissue images, particularly from immunohistochemistry (IHC) images. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel set of four comprehensive murine hippocampal IHC datasets featuring distinct staining modalities: cFos, NeuN, and multiplexed stains combining cFos, NeuN, and either {\Delta}FosB or GAD67, capturing structural, neuronal activity, and plasticity associated information. Additionally, we propose ROIsGAN, a region-guided U-Net-based generative adversarial network tailored for hippocampal subregion segmentation. By leveraging adversarial learning, ROIsGAN enhances boundary delineation and structural detail refinement through a novel region-guided discriminator loss combining Dice and binary cross-entropy loss. Evaluated across DG, CA1, and CA3 subregions, ROIsGAN consistently outperforms conventional segmentation models, achieving performance gains ranging from 1-10% in Dice score and up to 11% in Intersection over Union (IoU), particularly under challenging staining conditions. Our work establishes foundational datasets and methods for automated hippocampal segmentation, enabling scalable, high-precision analysis of tissue images in neuroscience research. Our generated datasets, proposed model as a standalone tool, and its corresponding source code are publicly available at: https://github.com/MehediAzim/ROIsGAN",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10687v1
Equal is Not Always Fair: A New Perspective on Hyperspectral   Representation Non-Uniformity,"Hyperspectral image (HSI) representation is fundamentally challenged by pervasive non-uniformity, where spectral dependencies, spatial continuity, and feature efficiency exhibit complex and often conflicting behaviors. Most existing models rely on a unified processing paradigm that assumes homogeneity across dimensions, leading to suboptimal performance and biased representations. To address this, we propose FairHyp, a fairness-directed framework that explicitly disentangles and resolves the threefold non-uniformity through cooperative yet specialized modules. We introduce a Runge-Kutta-inspired spatial variability adapter to restore spatial coherence under resolution discrepancies, a multi-receptive field convolution module with sparse-aware refinement to enhance discriminative features while respecting inherent sparsity, and a spectral-context state space model that captures stable and long-range spectral dependencies via bidirectional Mamba scanning and statistical aggregation. Unlike one-size-fits-all solutions, FairHyp achieves dimension-specific adaptation while preserving global consistency and mutual reinforcement. This design is grounded in the view that non-uniformity arises from the intrinsic structure of HSI representations, rather than any particular task setting. To validate this, we apply FairHyp across four representative tasks including classification, denoising, super-resolution, and inpaintin, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling a shared structural flaw. Extensive experiments show that FairHyp consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under varied imaging conditions. Our findings redefine fairness as a structural necessity in HSI modeling and offer a new paradigm for balancing adaptability, efficiency, and fidelity in high-dimensional vision tasks.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11267v1
Learning to Adapt to Position Bias in Vision Transformer Classifiers,"How discriminative position information is for image classification depends on the data. On the one hand, the camera position is arbitrary and objects can appear anywhere in the image, arguing for translation invariance. At the same time, position information is key for exploiting capture/center bias, and scene layout, e.g.: the sky is up. We show that position bias, the level to which a dataset is more easily solved when positional information on input features is used, plays a crucial role in the performance of Vision Transformers image classifiers. To investigate, we propose Position-SHAP, a direct measure of position bias by extending SHAP to work with position embeddings. We show various levels of position bias in different datasets, and find that the optimal choice of position embedding depends on the position bias apparent in the dataset. We therefore propose Auto-PE, a single-parameter position embedding extension, which allows the position embedding to modulate its norm, enabling the unlearning of position information. Auto-PE combines with existing PEs to match or improve accuracy on classification datasets.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13137v1
From Local Details to Global Context: Advancing Vision-Language Models   with Attention-Based Selection,"Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), e.g., CLIP, demonstrate impressive zero-shot capabilities on downstream tasks. Prior research highlights the crucial role of visual augmentation techniques, like random cropping, in alignment with fine-grained class descriptions generated by large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing zero-shot performance by incorporating multi-view information. However, the inherent randomness of these augmentations can inevitably introduce background artifacts and cause models to overly focus on local details, compromising global semantic understanding. To address these issues, we propose an \textbf{A}ttention-\textbf{B}ased \textbf{S}election (\textbf{ABS}) method from local details to global context, which applies attention-guided cropping in both raw images and feature space, supplement global semantic information through strategic feature selection. Additionally, we introduce a soft matching technique to effectively filter LLM descriptions for better alignment. \textbf{ABS} achieves state-of-the-art performance on out-of-distribution generalization and zero-shot classification tasks. Notably, \textbf{ABS} is training-free and even rivals few-shot and test-time adaptation methods.

TinyRS-R1: Compact Multimodal Language Model for Remote Sensing,"Remote-sensing applications often run on edge hardware that cannot host today's 7B-parameter multimodal language models. This paper introduces TinyRS, the first 2B-parameter multimodal small language model (MSLM) optimized for remote sensing tasks, and TinyRS-R1, its reasoning-augmented variant. Built upon Qwen2-VL-2B, TinyRS is trained through a four-stage pipeline: pre-training on million satellite images, instruction tuning on visual instruction examples, fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations from the proposed reasoning dataset, and alignment via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). TinyRS-R1 achieves or surpasses the performance of recent 7B-parameter remote sensing models across classification, VQA, visual grounding, and open-ended question answering-while requiring just one-third of the memory and latency. Our analysis shows that CoT reasoning substantially benefits spatial grounding and scene understanding, while the non-reasoning TinyRS excels in concise, latency-sensitive VQA tasks. TinyRS-R1 represents the first domain-specialized MSLM with GRPO-aligned CoT reasoning for general-purpose remote sensing.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12099v1
Technical Report for ICRA 2025 GOOSE 2D Semantic Segmentation Challenge:   Boosting Off-Road Segmentation via Photometric Distortion and Exponential   Moving Average,"We report on the application of a high-capacity semantic segmentation pipeline to the GOOSE 2D Semantic Segmentation Challenge for unstructured off-road environments. Using a FlashInternImage-B backbone together with a UPerNet decoder, we adapt established techniques, rather than designing new ones, to the distinctive conditions of off-road scenes. Our training recipe couples strong photometric distortion augmentation (to emulate the wide lighting variations of outdoor terrain) with an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of weights for better generalization. Using only the GOOSE training dataset, we achieve 88.8\% mIoU on the validation set.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11769v1
Unsupervised Detection of Distribution Shift in Inverse Problems using   Diffusion Models,"Diffusion models are widely used as priors in imaging inverse problems. However, their performance often degrades under distribution shifts between the training and test-time images. Existing methods for identifying and quantifying distribution shifts typically require access to clean test images, which are almost never available while solving inverse problems (at test time). We propose a fully unsupervised metric for estimating distribution shifts using only indirect (corrupted) measurements and score functions from diffusion models trained on different datasets. We theoretically show that this metric estimates the KL divergence between the training and test image distributions. Empirically, we show that our score-based metric, using only corrupted measurements, closely approximates the KL divergence computed from clean images. Motivated by this result, we show that aligning the out-of-distribution score with the in-distribution score -- using only corrupted measurements -- reduces the KL divergence and leads to improved reconstruction quality across multiple inverse problems.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11482v1
Automatic Complementary Separation Pruning Toward Lightweight CNNs,"In this paper, we present Automatic Complementary Separation Pruning (ACSP), a novel and fully automated pruning method for convolutional neural networks. ACSP integrates the strengths of both structured pruning and activation-based pruning, enabling the efficient removal of entire components such as neurons and channels while leveraging activations to identify and retain the most relevant components. Our approach is designed specifically for supervised learning tasks, where we construct a graph space that encodes the separation capabilities of each component with respect to all class pairs. By employing complementary selection principles and utilizing a clustering algorithm, ACSP ensures that the selected components maintain diverse and complementary separation capabilities, reducing redundancy and maintaining high network performance. The method automatically determines the optimal subset of components in each layer, utilizing a knee-finding algorithm to select the minimal subset that preserves performance without requiring user-defined pruning volumes. Extensive experiments on multiple architectures, including VGG-16, ResNet-50, and MobileNet-V2, across datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K, demonstrate that ACSP achieves competitive accuracy compared to other methods while significantly reducing computational costs. This fully automated approach not only enhances scalability but also makes ACSP especially practical for real-world deployment by eliminating the need for manually defining the pruning volume.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13225v1
Visual Anomaly Detection under Complex View-Illumination Interplay: A   Large-Scale Benchmark,"The practical deployment of Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) systems is hindered by their sensitivity to real-world imaging variations, particularly the complex interplay between viewpoint and illumination which drastically alters defect visibility. Current benchmarks largely overlook this critical challenge. We introduce Multi-View Multi-Illumination Anomaly Detection (M2AD), a new large-scale benchmark comprising 119,880 high-resolution images designed explicitly to probe VAD robustness under such interacting conditions. By systematically capturing 999 specimens across 10 categories using 12 synchronized views and 10 illumination settings (120 configurations total), M2AD enables rigorous evaluation. We establish two evaluation protocols: M2AD-Synergy tests the ability to fuse information across diverse configurations, and M2AD-Invariant measures single-image robustness against realistic view-illumination effects. Our extensive benchmarking shows that state-of-the-art VAD methods struggle significantly on M2AD, demonstrating the profound challenge posed by view-illumination interplay. This benchmark serves as an essential tool for developing and validating VAD methods capable of overcoming real-world complexities. Our full dataset and test suite will be released at https://hustcyq.github.io/M2AD to facilitate the field.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10996v1
MAVOS-DD: Multilingual Audio-Video Open-Set Deepfake Detection Benchmark,"We present the first large-scale open-set benchmark for multilingual audio-video deepfake detection. Our dataset comprises over 250 hours of real and fake videos across eight languages, with 60% of data being generated. For each language, the fake videos are generated with seven distinct deepfake generation models, selected based on the quality of the generated content. We organize the training, validation and test splits such that only a subset of the chosen generative models and languages are available during training, thus creating several challenging open-set evaluation setups. We perform experiments with various pre-trained and fine-tuned deepfake detectors proposed in recent literature. Our results show that state-of-the-art detectors are not currently able to maintain their performance levels when tested in our open-set scenarios. We publicly release our data and code at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/unibuc-cs/MAVOS-DD.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11109v1
Adversarial Robustness for Unified Multi-Modal Encoders via Efficient   Calibration,"Recent unified multi-modal encoders align a wide range of modalities into a shared representation space, enabling diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite their impressive capabilities, the robustness of these models under adversarial perturbations remains underexplored, which is a critical concern for safety-sensitive applications. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of adversarial vulnerability in unified multi-modal encoders. We find that even mild adversarial perturbations lead to substantial performance drops across all modalities. Non-visual inputs, such as audio and point clouds, are especially fragile, while visual inputs like images and videos also degrade significantly. To address this, we propose an efficient adversarial calibration framework that improves robustness across modalities without modifying pretrained encoders or semantic centers, ensuring compatibility with existing foundation models. Our method introduces modality-specific projection heads trained solely on adversarial examples, while keeping the backbone and embeddings frozen. We explore three training objectives: fixed-center cross-entropy, clean-to-adversarial L2 alignment, and clean-adversarial InfoNCE, and we introduce a regularization strategy to ensure modality-consistent alignment under attack. Experiments on six modalities and three Bind-style models show that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to 47.3 percent at epsilon = 4/255, while preserving or even improving clean zero-shot and retrieval performance with less than 1 percent trainable parameters.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11895v1
CacheFlow: Fast Human Motion Prediction by Cached Normalizing Flow,"Many density estimation techniques for 3D human motion prediction require a significant amount of inference time, often exceeding the duration of the predicted time horizon. To address the need for faster density estimation for 3D human motion prediction, we introduce a novel flow-based method for human motion prediction called CacheFlow. Unlike previous conditional generative models that suffer from time efficiency, CacheFlow takes advantage of an unconditional flow-based generative model that transforms a Gaussian mixture into the density of future motions. The results of the computation of the flow-based generative model can be precomputed and cached. Then, for conditional prediction, we seek a mapping from historical trajectories to samples in the Gaussian mixture. This mapping can be done by a much more lightweight model, thus saving significant computation overhead compared to a typical conditional flow model. In such a two-stage fashion and by caching results from the slow flow model computation, we build our CacheFlow without loss of prediction accuracy and model expressiveness. This inference process is completed in approximately one millisecond, making it 4 times faster than previous VAE methods and 30 times faster than previous diffusion-based methods on standard benchmarks such as Human3.6M and AMASS datasets. Furthermore, our method demonstrates improved density estimation accuracy and comparable prediction accuracy to a SOTA method on Human3.6M. Our code and models will be publicly available.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13140v1
CTP: A hybrid CNN-Transformer-PINN model for ocean front forecasting,"This paper proposes CTP, a novel deep learning framework that integrates convolutional neural network(CNN), Transformer architectures, and physics-informed neural network(PINN) for ocean front prediction. Ocean fronts, as dynamic interfaces between distinct water masses, play critical roles in marine biogeochemical and physical processes. Existing methods such as LSTM, ConvLSTM, and AttentionConv often struggle to maintain spatial continuity and physical consistency over multi-step forecasts. CTP addresses these challenges by combining localized spatial encoding, long-range temporal attention, and physical constraint enforcement. Experimental results across south China sea(SCS) and Kuroshio(KUR) regions from 1993 to 2020 demonstrate that CTP achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance in both single-step and multi-step predictions, significantly outperforming baseline models in accuracy, $F_1$ score, and temporal stability.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10894v1
CURE: Concept Unlearning via Orthogonal Representation Editing in   Diffusion Models,"As Text-to-Image models continue to evolve, so does the risk of generating unsafe, copyrighted, or privacy-violating content. Existing safety interventions - ranging from training data curation and model fine-tuning to inference-time filtering and guidance - often suffer from incomplete concept removal, susceptibility to jail-breaking, computational inefficiency, or collateral damage to unrelated capabilities. In this paper, we introduce CURE, a training-free concept unlearning framework that operates directly in the weight space of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling fast, interpretable, and highly specific suppression of undesired concepts. At the core of our method is the Spectral Eraser, a closed-form, orthogonal projection module that identifies discriminative subspaces using Singular Value Decomposition over token embeddings associated with the concepts to forget and retain. Intuitively, the Spectral Eraser identifies and isolates features unique to the undesired concept while preserving safe attributes. This operator is then applied in a single step update to yield an edited model in which the target concept is effectively unlearned - without retraining, supervision, or iterative optimization. To balance the trade-off between filtering toxicity and preserving unrelated concepts, we further introduce an Expansion Mechanism for spectral regularization which selectively modulates singular vectors based on their relative significance to control the strength of forgetting. All the processes above are in closed-form, guaranteeing extremely efficient erasure in only $2$ seconds. Benchmarking against prior approaches, CURE achieves a more efficient and thorough removal for targeted artistic styles, objects, identities, or explicit content, with minor damage to original generation ability and demonstrates enhanced robustness against red-teaming.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12677v1
GA3CE: Unconstrained 3D Gaze Estimation with Gaze-Aware 3D Context   Encoding,"We propose a novel 3D gaze estimation approach that learns spatial relationships between the subject and objects in the scene, and outputs 3D gaze direction. Our method targets unconstrained settings, including cases where close-up views of the subject's eyes are unavailable, such as when the subject is distant or facing away. Previous approaches typically rely on either 2D appearance alone or incorporate limited spatial cues using depth maps in the non-learnable post-processing step. Estimating 3D gaze direction from 2D observations in these scenarios is challenging; variations in subject pose, scene layout, and gaze direction, combined with differing camera poses, yield diverse 2D appearances and 3D gaze directions even when targeting the same 3D scene. To address this issue, we propose GA3CE: Gaze-Aware 3D Context Encoding. Our method represents subject and scene using 3D poses and object positions, treating them as 3D context to learn spatial relationships in 3D space. Inspired by human vision, we align this context in an egocentric space, significantly reducing spatial complexity. Furthermore, we propose D$^3$ (direction-distance-decomposed) positional encoding to better capture the spatial relationship between 3D context and gaze direction in direction and distance space. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements, reducing mean angle error by 13%-37% compared to leading baselines on benchmark datasets in single-frame settings.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10671v1
Dynamic Base model Shift for Delta Compression,"Transformer-based models with the pretrain-finetune paradigm bring about significant progress, along with the heavy storage and deployment costs of finetuned models on multiple tasks. Delta compression attempts to lower the costs by reducing the redundancy of delta parameters (i.e., the difference between the finetuned and pre-trained model weights) through pruning or quantization. However, existing methods by default employ the pretrained model as the base model and compress the delta parameters for every task, which may causes significant performance degradation, especially when the compression rate is extremely high. To tackle this issue, we investigate the impact of different base models on the performance of delta compression and find that the pre-trained base model can hardly be optimal. To this end, we propose Dynamic Base Model Shift (DBMS), which dynamically adapts the base model to the target task before performing delta compression. Specifically, we adjust two parameters, which respectively determine the magnitude of the base model shift and the overall scale of delta compression, to boost the compression performance on each task. Through low-cost learning of these two parameters, our DBMS can maintain most of the finetuned model's performance even under an extremely high compression ratio setting, significantly surpassing existing methods. Moreover, our DBMS is orthogonal and can be integrated with a variety of other methods, and it has been evaluated across different types of models including language, vision transformer, and multi-modal models.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11344v1
ChartMuseum: Testing Visual Reasoning Capabilities of Large   Vision-Language Models,"Chart understanding presents a unique challenge for large vision-language models (LVLMs), as it requires the integration of sophisticated textual and visual reasoning capabilities. However, current LVLMs exhibit a notable imbalance between these skills, falling short on visual reasoning that is difficult to perform in text. We conduct a case study using a synthetic dataset solvable only through visual reasoning and show that model performance degrades significantly with increasing visual complexity, while human performance remains robust. We then introduce ChartMuseum, a new Chart Question Answering (QA) benchmark containing 1,162 expert-annotated questions spanning multiple reasoning types, curated from real-world charts across 184 sources, specifically built to evaluate complex visual and textual reasoning. Unlike prior chart understanding benchmarks -- where frontier models perform similarly and near saturation -- our benchmark exposes a substantial gap between model and human performance, while effectively differentiating model capabilities: although humans achieve 93% accuracy, the best-performing model Gemini-2.5-Pro attains only 63.0%, and the leading open-source LVLM Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct achieves only 38.5%. Moreover, on questions requiring primarily visual reasoning, all models experience a 35%-55% performance drop from text-reasoning-heavy question performance. Lastly, our qualitative error analysis reveals specific categories of visual reasoning that are challenging for current LVLMs.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13444v1
Classifying Shelf Life Quality of Pineapples by Combining Audio and   Visual Features,"Determining the shelf life quality of pineapples using non-destructive methods is a crucial step to reduce waste and increase income. In this paper, a multimodal and multiview classification model was constructed to classify pineapples into four quality levels based on audio and visual characteristics. For research purposes, we compiled and released the PQC500 dataset consisting of 500 pineapples with two modalities: one was tapping pineapples to record sounds by multiple microphones and the other was taking pictures by multiple cameras at different locations, providing multimodal and multi-view audiovisual features. We modified the contrastive audiovisual masked autoencoder to train the cross-modal-based classification model by abundant combinations of audio and visual pairs. In addition, we proposed to sample a compact size of training data for efficient computation. The experiments were evaluated under various data and model configurations, and the results demonstrated that the proposed cross-modal model trained using audio-major sampling can yield 84% accuracy, outperforming the unimodal models of only audio and only visual by 6% and 18%, respectively.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11020v1
DRAGON: A Large-Scale Dataset of Realistic Images Generated by Diffusion   Models,"The remarkable ease of use of diffusion models for image generation has led to a proliferation of synthetic content online. While these models are often employed for legitimate purposes, they are also used to generate fake images that support misinformation and hate speech. Consequently, it is crucial to develop robust tools capable of detecting whether an image has been generated by such models. Many current detection methods, however, require large volumes of sample images for training. Unfortunately, due to the rapid evolution of the field, existing datasets often cover only a limited range of models and quickly become outdated. In this work, we introduce DRAGON, a comprehensive dataset comprising images from 25 diffusion models, spanning both recent advancements and older, well-established architectures. The dataset contains a broad variety of images representing diverse subjects. To enhance image realism, we propose a simple yet effective pipeline that leverages a large language model to expand input prompts, thereby generating more diverse and higher-quality outputs, as evidenced by improvements in standard quality metrics. The dataset is provided in multiple sizes (ranging from extra-small to extra-large) to accomodate different research scenarios. DRAGON is designed to support the forensic community in developing and evaluating detection and attribution techniques for synthetic content. Additionally, the dataset is accompanied by a dedicated test set, intended to serve as a benchmark for assessing the performance of newly developed methods.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11257v1
A Convolution-Based Gait Asymmetry Metric for Inter-Limb Synergistic   Coordination,"This study focuses on the velocity patterns of various body parts during walking and proposes a method for evaluating gait symmetry. Traditional motion analysis studies have assessed gait symmetry based on differences in electromyographic (EMG) signals or acceleration between the left and right sides. In contrast, this paper models intersegmental coordination using an LTI system and proposes a dissimilarity metric to evaluate symmetry. The method was tested on five subjects with both symmetric and asymmetric gait.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10869v1
"Seeing Sound, Hearing Sight: Uncovering Modality Bias and Conflict of AI   models in Sound Localization","Imagine hearing a dog bark and turning toward the sound only to see a parked car, while the real, silent dog sits elsewhere. Such sensory conflicts test perception, yet humans reliably resolve them by prioritizing sound over misleading visuals. Despite advances in multimodal AI integrating vision and audio, little is known about how these systems handle cross-modal conflicts or whether they favor one modality. In this study, we systematically examine modality bias and conflict resolution in AI sound localization. We assess leading multimodal models and benchmark them against human performance in psychophysics experiments across six audiovisual conditions, including congruent, conflicting, and absent cues. Humans consistently outperform AI, demonstrating superior resilience to conflicting or missing visuals by relying on auditory information. In contrast, AI models often default to visual input, degrading performance to near chance levels. To address this, we finetune a state-of-the-art model using a stereo audio-image dataset generated via 3D simulations. Even with limited training data, the refined model surpasses existing benchmarks. Notably, it also mirrors human-like horizontal localization bias favoring left-right precision-likely due to the stereo audio structure reflecting human ear placement. These findings underscore how sensory input quality and system architecture shape multimodal representation accuracy.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11217v1
HSRMamba: Efficient Wavelet Stripe State Space Model for Hyperspectral   Image Super-Resolution,"Single hyperspectral image super-resolution (SHSR) aims to restore high-resolution images from low-resolution hyperspectral images. Recently, the Visual Mamba model has achieved an impressive balance between performance and computational efficiency. However, due to its 1D scanning paradigm, the model may suffer from potential artifacts during image generation. To address this issue, we propose HSRMamba. While maintaining the computational efficiency of Visual Mamba, we introduce a strip-based scanning scheme to effectively reduce artifacts from global unidirectional scanning. Additionally, HSRMamba uses wavelet decomposition to alleviate modal conflicts between high-frequency spatial features and low-frequency spectral features, further improving super-resolution performance. Extensive experiments show that HSRMamba not only excels in reducing computational load and model size but also outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11062v1
Behind the Screens: Uncovering Bias in AI-Driven Video Interview   Assessments Using Counterfactuals,"AI-enhanced personality assessments are increasingly shaping hiring decisions, using affective computing to predict traits from the Big Five (OCEAN) model. However, integrating AI into these assessments raises ethical concerns, especially around bias amplification rooted in training data. These biases can lead to discriminatory outcomes based on protected attributes like gender, ethnicity, and age. To address this, we introduce a counterfactual-based framework to systematically evaluate and quantify bias in AI-driven personality assessments. Our approach employs generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate counterfactual representations of job applicants by altering protected attributes, enabling fairness analysis without access to the underlying model. Unlike traditional bias assessments that focus on unimodal or static data, our method supports multimodal evaluation-spanning visual, audio, and textual features. This comprehensive approach is particularly important in high-stakes applications like hiring, where third-party vendors often provide AI systems as black boxes. Applied to a state-of-the-art personality prediction model, our method reveals significant disparities across demographic groups. We also validate our framework using a protected attribute classifier to confirm the effectiveness of our counterfactual generation. This work provides a scalable tool for fairness auditing of commercial AI hiring platforms, especially in black-box settings where training data and model internals are inaccessible. Our results highlight the importance of counterfactual approaches in improving ethical transparency in affective computing.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12114v1
From Shots to Stories: LLM-Assisted Video Editing with Unified Language   Representations,"Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities in video understanding; however, their application in video editing remains largely underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of LLMs in the context of video editing. To bridge the gap between visual information and language-based reasoning, we introduce L-Storyboard, an intermediate representation that transforms discrete video shots into structured language descriptions suitable for LLM processing. We categorize video editing tasks into Convergent Tasks and Divergent Tasks, focusing on three core tasks: Shot Attributes Classification, Next Shot Selection, and Shot Sequence Ordering. To address the inherent instability of divergent task outputs, we propose the StoryFlow strategy, which converts the divergent multi-path reasoning process into a convergent selection mechanism, effectively enhancing task accuracy and logical coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that L-Storyboard facilitates a more robust mapping between visual information and language descriptions, significantly improving the interpretability and privacy protection of video editing tasks. Furthermore, StoryFlow enhances the logical consistency and output stability in Shot Sequence Ordering, underscoring the substantial potential of LLMs in intelligent video editing.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12237v1
PSDiffusion: Harmonized Multi-Layer Image Generation via Layout and   Appearance Alignment,"Diffusion models have made remarkable advancements in generating high-quality images from textual descriptions. Recent works like LayerDiffuse have extended the previous single-layer, unified image generation paradigm to transparent image layer generation. However, existing multi-layer generation methods fail to handle the interactions among multiple layers such as rational global layout, physics-plausible contacts and visual effects like shadows and reflections while maintaining high alpha quality. To solve this problem, we propose PSDiffusion, a unified diffusion framework for simultaneous multi-layer text-to-image generation. Our model can automatically generate multi-layer images with one RGB background and multiple RGBA foregrounds through a single feed-forward process. Unlike existing methods that combine multiple tools for post-decomposition or generate layers sequentially and separately, our method introduces a global-layer interactive mechanism that generates layered-images concurrently and collaboratively, ensuring not only high quality and completeness for each layer, but also spatial and visual interactions among layers for global coherence.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11468v1
Experimental Study on Automatically Assembling Custom Catering Packages   With a 3-DOF Delta Robot Using Deep Learning Methods,"This paper introduces a pioneering experimental study on the automated packing of a catering package using a two-fingered gripper affixed to a 3-degree-of-freedom Delta parallel robot. A distinctive contribution lies in the application of a deep learning approach to tackle this challenge. A custom dataset, comprising 1,500 images, is meticulously curated for this endeavor, representing a noteworthy initiative as the first dataset focusing on Persian-manufactured products. The study employs the YOLOV5 model for object detection, followed by segmentation using the FastSAM model. Subsequently, rotation angle calculation is facilitated with segmentation masks, and a rotated rectangle encapsulating the object is generated. This rectangle forms the basis for calculating two grasp points using a novel geometrical approach involving eigenvectors. An extensive experimental study validates the proposed model, where all pertinent information is seamlessly transmitted to the 3-DOF Delta parallel robot. The proposed algorithm ensures real-time detection, calibration, and the fully autonomous packing process of a catering package, boasting an impressive over 80\% success rate in automatic grasping. This study marks a significant stride in advancing the capabilities of robotic systems for practical applications in packaging automation.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11879v1
DB3D-L: Depth-aware BEV Feature Transformation for Accurate 3D Lane   Detection,"3D Lane detection plays an important role in autonomous driving. Recent advances primarily build Birds-Eye-View (BEV) feature from front-view (FV) images to perceive 3D information of Lane more effectively. However, constructing accurate BEV information from FV image is limited due to the lacking of depth information, causing previous works often rely heavily on the assumption of a flat ground plane. Leveraging monocular depth estimation to assist in constructing BEV features is less constrained, but existing methods struggle to effectively integrate the two tasks. To address the above issue, in this paper, an accurate 3D lane detection method based on depth-aware BEV feature transtormation is proposed. In detail, an effective feature extraction module is designed, in which a Depth Net is integrated to obtain the vital depth information for 3D perception, thereby simplifying the complexity of view transformation. Subquently a feature reduce module is proposed to reduce height dimension of FV features and depth features, thereby enables effective fusion of crucial FV features and depth features. Then a fusion module is designed to build BEV feature from prime FV feature and depth information. The proposed method performs comparably with state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic Apollo, realistic OpenLane datasets.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13266v1
AdaToken-3D: Dynamic Spatial Gating for Efficient 3D Large   Multimodal-Models Reasoning,"Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have become a pivotal research focus in deep learning, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D LMMs employing thousands of spatial tokens for multimodal reasoning suffer from critical inefficiencies: excessive computational overhead and redundant information flows. Unlike 2D VLMs processing single images, 3D LMMs exhibit inherent architectural redundancy due to the heterogeneous mechanisms between spatial tokens and visual tokens. To address this challenge, we propose AdaToken-3D, an adaptive spatial token optimization framework that dynamically prunes redundant tokens through spatial contribution analysis. Our method automatically tailors pruning strategies to different 3D LMM architectures by quantifying token-level information flows via attention pattern mining. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-3D (a 7B parameter 3D-LMM) demonstrate that AdaToken-3D achieves 21\% faster inference speed and 63\% FLOPs reduction while maintaining original task accuracy. Beyond efficiency gains, this work systematically investigates redundancy patterns in multimodal spatial information flows through quantitative token interaction analysis. Our findings reveal that over 60\% of spatial tokens contribute minimally ($<$5\%) to the final predictions, establishing theoretical foundations for efficient 3D multimodal learning.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12782v1
Improved Bag-of-Words Image Retrieval with Geometric Constraints for   Ground Texture Localization,"Ground texture localization using a downward-facing camera offers a low-cost, high-precision localization solution that is robust to dynamic environments and requires no environmental modification. We present a significantly improved bag-of-words (BoW) image retrieval system for ground texture localization, achieving substantially higher accuracy for global localization and higher precision and recall for loop closure detection in SLAM. Our approach leverages an approximate $k$-means (AKM) vocabulary with soft assignment, and exploits the consistent orientation and constant scale constraints inherent to ground texture localization. Identifying the different needs of global localization vs. loop closure detection for SLAM, we present both high-accuracy and high-speed versions of our algorithm. We test the effect of each of our proposed improvements through an ablation study and demonstrate our method's effectiveness for both global localization and loop closure detection. With numerous ground texture localization systems already using BoW, our method can readily replace other generic BoW systems in their pipeline and immediately improve their results.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11620v1
Automated Detection of Salvin's Albatrosses: Improving Deep Learning   Tools for Aerial Wildlife Surveys,"Recent advancements in deep learning and aerial imaging have transformed wildlife monitoring, enabling researchers to survey wildlife populations at unprecedented scales. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide a cost-effective means of capturing high-resolution imagery, particularly for monitoring densely populated seabird colonies. In this study, we assess the performance of a general-purpose avian detection model, BirdDetector, in estimating the breeding population of Salvin's albatross (Thalassarche salvini) on the Bounty Islands, New Zealand. Using drone-derived imagery, we evaluate the model's effectiveness in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, incorporating enhanced inference techniques and stronger augmentation methods. Our findings indicate that while applying the model in a zero-shot setting offers a strong baseline, fine-tuning with annotations from the target domain and stronger image augmentation leads to marked improvements in detection accuracy. These results highlight the potential of leveraging pre-trained deep-learning models for species-specific monitoring in remote and challenging environments.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10737v1
What's Inside Your Diffusion Model? A Score-Based Riemannian Metric to   Explore the Data Manifold,"Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated their remarkable ability to capture complex image distributions, but the geometric properties of the learned data manifold remain poorly understood. We address this gap by introducing a score-based Riemannian metric that leverages the Stein score function from diffusion models to characterize the intrinsic geometry of the data manifold without requiring explicit parameterization. Our approach defines a metric tensor in the ambient space that stretches distances perpendicular to the manifold while preserving them along tangential directions, effectively creating a geometry where geodesics naturally follow the manifold's contours. We develop efficient algorithms for computing these geodesics and demonstrate their utility for both interpolation between data points and extrapolation beyond the observed data distribution. Through experiments on synthetic data with known geometry, Rotated MNIST, and complex natural images via Stable Diffusion, we show that our score-based geodesics capture meaningful transformations that respect the underlying data distribution. Our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches on perceptual metrics (LPIPS) and distribution-level metrics (FID, KID), producing smoother, more realistic image transitions. These results reveal the implicit geometric structure learned by diffusion models and provide a principled way to navigate the manifold of natural images through the lens of Riemannian geometry.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11128v2
Faster Video Diffusion with Trainable Sparse Attention,"Scaling video diffusion transformers (DiTs) is limited by their quadratic 3D attention, even though most of the attention mass concentrates on a small subset of positions. We turn this observation into VSA, a trainable, hardware-efficient sparse attention that replaces full attention at \emph{both} training and inference. In VSA, a lightweight coarse stage pools tokens into tiles and identifies high-weight \emph{critical tokens}; a fine stage computes token-level attention only inside those tiles subjecting to block computing layout to ensure hard efficiency. This leads to a single differentiable kernel that trains end-to-end, requires no post-hoc profiling, and sustains 85\% of FlashAttention3 MFU. We perform a large sweep of ablation studies and scaling-law experiments by pretraining DiTs from 60M to 1.4B parameters. VSA reaches a Pareto point that cuts training FLOPS by 2.53$\times$ with no drop in diffusion loss. Retrofitting the open-source Wan-2.1 model speeds up attention time by 6$\times$ and lowers end-to-end generation time from 31s to 18s with comparable quality. These results establish trainable sparse attention as a practical alternative to full attention and a key enabler for further scaling of video diffusion models.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13389v1
UniMoCo: Unified Modality Completion for Robust Multi-Modal Embeddings,"Current research has explored vision-language models for multi-modal embedding tasks, such as information retrieval, visual grounding, and classification. However, real-world scenarios often involve diverse modality combinations between queries and targets, such as text and image to text, text and image to text and image, and text to text and image. These diverse combinations pose significant challenges for existing models, as they struggle to align all modality combinations within a unified embedding space during training, which degrades performance at inference. To address this limitation, we propose UniMoCo, a novel vision-language model architecture designed for multi-modal embedding tasks. UniMoCo introduces a modality-completion module that generates visual features from textual inputs, ensuring modality completeness for both queries and targets. Additionally, we develop a specialized training strategy to align embeddings from both original and modality-completed inputs, ensuring consistency within the embedding space. This enables the model to robustly handle a wide range of modality combinations across embedding tasks. Experiments show that UniMoCo outperforms previous methods while demonstrating consistent robustness across diverse settings. More importantly, we identify and quantify the inherent bias in conventional approaches caused by imbalance of modality combinations in training data, which can be mitigated through our modality-completion paradigm. The code is available at https://github.com/HobbitQia/UniMoCo.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11815v1
Multi-view dense image matching with similarity learning and geometry   priors,"We introduce MV-DeepSimNets, a comprehensive suite of deep neural networks designed for multi-view similarity learning, leveraging epipolar geometry for training. Our approach incorporates an online geometry prior to characterize pixel relationships, either along the epipolar line or through homography rectification. This enables the generation of geometry-aware features from native images, which are then projected across candidate depth hypotheses using plane sweeping. Our method geometric preconditioning effectively adapts epipolar-based features for enhanced multi-view reconstruction, without requiring the laborious multi-view training dataset creation. By aggregating learned similarities, we construct and regularize the cost volume, leading to improved multi-view surface reconstruction over traditional dense matching approaches. MV-DeepSimNets demonstrates superior performance against leading similarity learning networks and end-to-end regression models, especially in terms of generalization capabilities across both aerial and satellite imagery with varied ground sampling distances. Our pipeline is integrated into MicMac software and can be readily adopted in standard multi-resolution image matching pipelines.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11264v1
FIGhost: Fluorescent Ink-based Stealthy and Flexible Backdoor Attacks on   Physical Traffic Sign Recognition,"Traffic sign recognition (TSR) systems are crucial for autonomous driving but are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing physical backdoor attacks either lack stealth, provide inflexible attack control, or ignore emerging Vision-Large-Language-Models (VLMs). In this paper, we introduce FIGhost, the first physical-world backdoor attack leveraging fluorescent ink as triggers. Fluorescent triggers are invisible under normal conditions and activated stealthily by ultraviolet light, providing superior stealthiness, flexibility, and untraceability. Inspired by real-world graffiti, we derive realistic trigger shapes and enhance their robustness via an interpolation-based fluorescence simulation algorithm. Furthermore, we develop an automated backdoor sample generation method to support three attack objectives. Extensive evaluations in the physical world demonstrate FIGhost's effectiveness against state-of-the-art detectors and VLMs, maintaining robustness under environmental variations and effectively evading existing defenses.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12045v1
Predicting Risk of Pulmonary Fibrosis Formation in PASC Patients,"While the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, its long-term effects persist through Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID. There remains substantial uncertainty regarding both its duration and optimal management strategies. PASC manifests as a diverse array of persistent or newly emerging symptoms--ranging from fatigue, dyspnea, and neurologic impairments (e.g., brain fog), to cardiovascular, pulmonary, and musculoskeletal abnormalities--that extend beyond the acute infection phase. This heterogeneous presentation poses substantial challenges for clinical assessment, diagnosis, and treatment planning. In this paper, we focus on imaging findings that may suggest fibrotic damage in the lungs, a critical manifestation characterized by scarring of lung tissue, which can potentially affect long-term respiratory function in patients with PASC. This study introduces a novel multi-center chest CT analysis framework that combines deep learning and radiomics for fibrosis prediction. Our approach leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and interpretable feature extraction, achieving 82.2% accuracy and 85.5% AUC in classification tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Grad-CAM visualization and radiomics-based feature analysis in providing clinically relevant insights for PASC-related lung fibrosis prediction. Our findings highlight the potential of deep learning-driven computational methods for early detection and risk assessment of PASC-related lung fibrosis--presented for the first time in the literature.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10691v1
UniEval: Unified Holistic Evaluation for Unified Multimodal   Understanding and Generation,"The emergence of unified multimodal understanding and generation models is rapidly attracting attention because of their ability to enhance instruction-following capabilities while minimizing model redundancy. However, there is a lack of a unified evaluation framework for these models, which would enable an elegant, simplified, and overall evaluation. Current models conduct evaluations on multiple task-specific benchmarks, but there are significant limitations, such as the lack of overall results, errors from extra evaluation models, reliance on extensive labeled images, benchmarks that lack diversity, and metrics with limited capacity for instruction-following evaluation. To tackle these challenges, we introduce UniEval, the first evaluation framework designed for unified multimodal models without extra models, images, or annotations. This facilitates a simplified and unified evaluation process. The UniEval framework contains a holistic benchmark, UniBench (supports both unified and visual generation models), along with the corresponding UniScore metric. UniBench includes 81 fine-grained tags contributing to high diversity. Experimental results indicate that UniBench is more challenging than existing benchmarks, and UniScore aligns closely with human evaluations, surpassing current metrics. Moreover, we extensively evaluated SoTA unified and visual generation models, uncovering new insights into Univeral's unique values.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10483v1
Structureless VIO,"Visual odometry (VO) is typically considered as a chicken-and-egg problem, as the localization and mapping modules are tightly-coupled. The estimation of visual map relies on accurate localization information. Meanwhile, localization requires precise map points to provide motion constraints. This classical design principle is naturally inherited by visual-inertial odometry (VIO). Efficient localization solution that does not require a map has not been fully investigated. To this end, we propose a novel structureless VIO, where the visual map is removed from the odometry framework. Experimental results demonstrated that, compared to the structure-based VIO baseline, our structureless VIO not only substantially improves computational efficiency but also has advantages in accuracy.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12337v1
GaussianFormer3D: Multi-Modal Gaussian-based Semantic Occupancy   Prediction with 3D Deformable Attention,"3D semantic occupancy prediction is critical for achieving safe and reliable autonomous driving. Compared to camera-only perception systems, multi-modal pipelines, especially LiDAR-camera fusion methods, can produce more accurate and detailed predictions. Although most existing works utilize a dense grid-based representation, in which the entire 3D space is uniformly divided into discrete voxels, the emergence of 3D Gaussians provides a compact and continuous object-centric representation. In this work, we propose a multi-modal Gaussian-based semantic occupancy prediction framework utilizing 3D deformable attention, named as GaussianFormer3D. We introduce a voxel-to-Gaussian initialization strategy to provide 3D Gaussians with geometry priors from LiDAR data, and design a LiDAR-guided 3D deformable attention mechanism for refining 3D Gaussians with LiDAR-camera fusion features in a lifted 3D space. We conducted extensive experiments on both on-road and off-road datasets, demonstrating that our GaussianFormer3D achieves high prediction accuracy that is comparable to state-of-the-art multi-modal fusion-based methods with reduced memory consumption and improved efficiency.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10685v1
GTR: Gaussian Splatting Tracking and Reconstruction of Unknown Objects   Based on Appearance and Geometric Complexity,"We present a novel method for 6-DoF object tracking and high-quality 3D reconstruction from monocular RGBD video. Existing methods, while achieving impressive results, often struggle with complex objects, particularly those exhibiting symmetry, intricate geometry or complex appearance. To bridge these gaps, we introduce an adaptive method that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting, hybrid geometry/appearance tracking, and key frame selection to achieve robust tracking and accurate reconstructions across a diverse range of objects. Additionally, we present a benchmark covering these challenging object classes, providing high-quality annotations for evaluating both tracking and reconstruction performance. Our approach demonstrates strong capabilities in recovering high-fidelity object meshes, setting a new standard for single-sensor 3D reconstruction in open-world environments.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11905v1
GLOVER++: Unleashing the Potential of Affordance Learning from Human   Behaviors for Robotic Manipulation,"Learning manipulation skills from human demonstration videos offers a promising path toward generalizable and interpretable robotic intelligence-particularly through the lens of actionable affordances. However, transferring such knowledge remains challenging due to: 1) a lack of large-scale datasets with precise affordance annotations, and 2) insufficient exploration of affordances in diverse manipulation contexts. To address these gaps, we introduce HOVA-500K, a large-scale, affordance-annotated dataset comprising 500,000 images across 1,726 object categories and 675 actions. We also release a standardized benchmarking suite for multi-modal affordance reasoning. Built upon HOVA-500K, we present GLOVER++, a global-to-local affordance training framework that effectively transfers actionable affordance knowledge from human demonstrations to downstream open-vocabulary reasoning tasks. GLOVER++ achieves state-of-the-art results on the HOVA-500K benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse downstream robotic manipulation tasks. By explicitly modeling actionable affordances, GLOVER++ facilitates robust transfer across scenes, modalities, and tasks. We hope that HOVA-500K and the GLOVER++ framework will serve as valuable resources for bridging the gap between human demonstrations and robotic manipulation capabilities.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11865v1
A Skull-Adaptive Framework for AI-Based 3D Transcranial Focused   Ultrasound Simulation,"Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is an emerging modality for non-invasive brain stimulation and therapeutic intervention, offering millimeter-scale spatial precision and the ability to target deep brain structures. However, the heterogeneous and anisotropic nature of the human skull introduces significant distortions to the propagating ultrasound wavefront, which require time-consuming patient-specific planning and corrections using numerical solvers for accurate targeting. To enable data-driven approaches in this domain, we introduce TFUScapes, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset of tFUS simulations through anatomically realistic human skulls derived from T1-weighted MRI images. We have developed a scalable simulation engine pipeline using the k-Wave pseudo-spectral solver, where each simulation returns a steady-state pressure field generated by a focused ultrasound transducer placed at realistic scalp locations. In addition to the dataset, we present DeepTFUS, a deep learning model that estimates normalized pressure fields directly from input 3D CT volumes and transducer position. The model extends a U-Net backbone with transducer-aware conditioning, incorporating Fourier-encoded position embeddings and MLP layers to create global transducer embeddings. These embeddings are fused with U-Net encoder features via feature-wise modulation, dynamic convolutions, and cross-attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of spatially weighted and gradient-sensitive loss functions, enabling it to approximate high-fidelity wavefields. The TFUScapes dataset is publicly released to accelerate research at the intersection of computational acoustics, neurotechnology, and deep learning. The project page is available at https://github.com/CAMMA-public/TFUScapes.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12998v1
Exploiting Radiance Fields for Grasp Generation on Novel Synthetic Views,"Vision based robot manipulation uses cameras to capture one or more images of a scene containing the objects to be manipulated. Taking multiple images can help if any object is occluded from one viewpoint but more visible from another viewpoint. However, the camera has to be moved to a sequence of suitable positions for capturing multiple images, which requires time and may not always be possible, due to reachability constraints. So while additional images can produce more accurate grasp poses due to the extra information available, the time-cost goes up with the number of additional views sampled. Scene representations like Gaussian Splatting are capable of rendering accurate photorealistic virtual images from user-specified novel viewpoints. In this work, we show initial results which indicate that novel view synthesis can provide additional context in generating grasp poses. Our experiments on the Graspnet-1billion dataset show that novel views contributed force-closure grasps in addition to the force-closure grasps obtained from sparsely sampled real views while also improving grasp coverage. In the future we hope this work can be extended to improve grasp extraction from radiance fields constructed with a single input image, using for example diffusion models or generalizable radiance fields.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11467v1
Redundancy-Aware Pretraining of Vision-Language Foundation Models in   Remote Sensing,"The development of foundation models through pretraining of vision-language models (VLMs) has recently attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS). VLM pretraining aims to learn image and language alignments from a large number of image-text pairs. Each pretraining image is often associated with multiple captions containing redundant information due to repeated or semantically similar phrases, resulting in increased pretraining and inference time. To overcome this, we introduce a weighted feature aggregation (WFA) strategy for VLM pretraining in RS. Our strategy aims to extract and exploit complementary information from multiple captions per image while reducing redundancies through feature aggregation with importance weighting. To calculate adaptive importance weights for different captions of each image, we propose two techniques: (i) non-parametric uniqueness and (ii) learning-based attention. In the first technique, importance weights are calculated based on the bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores of the captions to emphasize unique sentences and reduce the influence of repetitive ones. In the second technique, importance weights are learned through an attention mechanism instead of relying on hand-crafted features. The effectiveness of the proposed WFA strategy with the two techniques is analyzed in terms of downstream performance on text-to-image retrieval in RS. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy enables efficient and effective pretraining of VLMs in RS. Based on the experimental analysis, we derive guidelines for selecting appropriate techniques depending on downstream task requirements and resource constraints. The code of this work is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/redundacy-aware-rs-vlm.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11121v1
Top-Down Compression: Revisit Efficient Vision Token Projection for   Visual Instruction Tuning,"Visual instruction tuning aims to enable large language models to comprehend the visual world, with a pivotal challenge lying in establishing an effective vision-to-language projection. However, existing methods often grapple with the intractable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we present LLaVA-Meteor, a novel approach designed to break this deadlock, equipped with a novel Top-Down Compression paradigm that strategically compresses visual tokens without compromising core information. Specifically, we construct a trainable Flash Global Fusion module based on efficient selective state space operators, which aligns the feature space while enabling each token to perceive holistic visual context and instruction preference at low cost. Furthermore, a local-to-single scanning manner is employed to effectively capture local dependencies, thereby enhancing the model's capability in vision modeling. To alleviate computational overhead, we explore a Visual-Native Selection mechanism that independently assesses token significance by both the visual and native experts, followed by aggregation to retain the most critical subset. Extensive experiments show that our approach reduces visual tokens by 75--95% while achieving comparable or superior performance across 12 benchmarks, significantly improving efficiency.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11945v1
Pseudo-Label Quality Decoupling and Correction for Semi-Supervised   Instance Segmentation,"Semi-Supervised Instance Segmentation (SSIS) involves classifying and grouping image pixels into distinct object instances using limited labeled data. This learning paradigm usually faces a significant challenge of unstable performance caused by noisy pseudo-labels of instance categories and pixel masks. We find that the prevalent practice of filtering instance pseudo-labels assessing both class and mask quality with a single score threshold, frequently leads to compromises in the trade-off between the qualities of class and mask labels. In this paper, we introduce a novel Pseudo-Label Quality Decoupling and Correction (PL-DC) framework for SSIS to tackle the above challenges. Firstly, at the instance level, a decoupled dual-threshold filtering mechanism is designed to decouple class and mask quality estimations for instance-level pseudo-labels, thereby independently controlling pixel classifying and grouping qualities. Secondly, at the category level, we introduce a dynamic instance category correction module to dynamically correct the pseudo-labels of instance categories, effectively alleviating category confusion. Lastly, we introduce a pixel-level mask uncertainty-aware mechanism at the pixel level to re-weight the mask loss for different pixels, thereby reducing the impact of noise introduced by pixel-level mask pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on the COCO and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that the proposed PL-DC achieves significant performance improvements, setting new state-of-the-art results for SSIS. Notably, our PL-DC shows substantial gains even with minimal labeled data, achieving an improvement of +11.6 mAP with just 1% COCO labeled data and +15.5 mAP with 5% Cityscapes labeled data. The code will be public.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11075v1
OpenPros: A Large-Scale Dataset for Limited View Prostate Ultrasound   Computed Tomography,"Prostate cancer is one of the most common and lethal cancers among men, making its early detection critically important. Although ultrasound imaging offers greater accessibility and cost-effectiveness compared to MRI, traditional transrectal ultrasound methods suffer from low sensitivity, especially in detecting anteriorly located tumors. Ultrasound computed tomography provides quantitative tissue characterization, but its clinical implementation faces significant challenges, particularly under anatomically constrained limited-angle acquisition conditions specific to prostate imaging. To address these unmet needs, we introduce OpenPros, the first large-scale benchmark dataset explicitly developed for limited-view prostate USCT. Our dataset includes over 280,000 paired samples of realistic 2D speed-of-sound (SOS) phantoms and corresponding ultrasound full-waveform data, generated from anatomically accurate 3D digital prostate models derived from real clinical MRI/CT scans and ex vivo ultrasound measurements, annotated by medical experts. Simulations are conducted under clinically realistic configurations using advanced finite-difference time-domain and Runge-Kutta acoustic wave solvers, both provided as open-source components. Through comprehensive baseline experiments, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art deep learning methods surpass traditional physics-based approaches in both inference efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. Nevertheless, current deep learning models still fall short of delivering clinically acceptable high-resolution images with sufficient accuracy. By publicly releasing OpenPros, we aim to encourage the development of advanced machine learning algorithms capable of bridging this performance gap and producing clinically usable, high-resolution, and highly accurate prostate ultrasound images. The dataset is publicly accessible at https://open-pros.github.io/.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12261v1
Questioning Representational Optimism in Deep Learning: The Fractured   Entangled Representation Hypothesis,"Much of the excitement in modern AI is driven by the observation that scaling up existing systems leads to better performance. But does better performance necessarily imply better internal representations? While the representational optimist assumes it must, this position paper challenges that view. We compare neural networks evolved through an open-ended search process to networks trained via conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the simple task of generating a single image. This minimal setup offers a unique advantage: each hidden neuron's full functional behavior can be easily visualized as an image, thus revealing how the network's output behavior is internally constructed neuron by neuron. The result is striking: while both networks produce the same output behavior, their internal representations differ dramatically. The SGD-trained networks exhibit a form of disorganization that we term fractured entangled representation (FER). Interestingly, the evolved networks largely lack FER, even approaching a unified factored representation (UFR). In large models, FER may be degrading core model capacities like generalization, creativity, and (continual) learning. Therefore, understanding and mitigating FER could be critical to the future of representation learning.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11581v1
Exploring Implicit Visual Misunderstandings in Multimodal Large Language   Models through Attention Analysis,"Recent advancements have enhanced the capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to comprehend multi-image information. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate answer correctness, overlooking whether models genuinely comprehend the visual input. To address this, we define implicit visual misunderstanding (IVM), where MLLMs provide correct answers without fully comprehending the visual input. Through our analysis, we decouple the visual and textual modalities within the causal attention module, revealing that attention distribution increasingly converges on the image associated with the correct answer as the network layers deepen. This insight leads to the introduction of a scale-agnostic metric, \textit{attention accuracy}, and a novel benchmark for quantifying IVMs. Attention accuracy directly evaluates the model's visual understanding via internal mechanisms, remaining robust to positional biases for more reliable assessments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to finer granularities and demonstrate its effectiveness in unimodal scenarios, underscoring its versatility and generalizability.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10541v1
Mapping Semantic Segmentation to Point Clouds Using Structure from   Motion for Forest Analysis,"Although the use of remote sensing technologies for monitoring forested environments has gained increasing attention, publicly available point cloud datasets remain scarce due to the high costs, sensor requirements, and time-intensive nature of their acquisition. Moreover, as far as we are aware, there are no public annotated datasets generated through Structure From Motion (SfM) algorithms applied to imagery, which may be due to the lack of SfM algorithms that can map semantic segmentation information into an accurate point cloud, especially in a challenging environment like forests.   In this work, we present a novel pipeline for generating semantically segmented point clouds of forest environments. Using a custom-built forest simulator, we generate realistic RGB images of diverse forest scenes along with their corresponding semantic segmentation masks. These labeled images are then processed using modified open-source SfM software capable of preserving semantic information during 3D reconstruction. The resulting point clouds provide both geometric and semantic detail, offering a valuable resource for training and evaluating deep learning models aimed at segmenting real forest point clouds obtained via SfM.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10751v1
SurgPose: Generalisable Surgical Instrument Pose Estimation using   Zero-Shot Learning and Stereo Vision,"Accurate pose estimation of surgical tools in Robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS) is essential for surgical navigation and robot control. While traditional marker-based methods offer accuracy, they face challenges with occlusions, reflections, and tool-specific designs. Similarly, supervised learning methods require extensive training on annotated datasets, limiting their adaptability to new tools. Despite their success in other domains, zero-shot pose estimation models remain unexplored in RMIS for pose estimation of surgical instruments, creating a gap in generalising to unseen surgical tools. This paper presents a novel 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) pose estimation pipeline for surgical instruments, leveraging state-of-the-art zero-shot RGB-D models like the FoundationPose and SAM-6D. We advanced these models by incorporating vision-based depth estimation using the RAFT-Stereo method, for robust depth estimation in reflective and textureless environments. Additionally, we enhanced SAM-6D by replacing its instance segmentation module, Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a fine-tuned Mask R-CNN, significantly boosting segmentation accuracy in occluded and complex conditions. Extensive validation reveals that our enhanced SAM-6D surpasses FoundationPose in zero-shot pose estimation of unseen surgical instruments, setting a new benchmark for zero-shot RGB-D pose estimation in RMIS. This work enhances the generalisability of pose estimation for unseen objects and pioneers the application of RGB-D zero-shot methods in RMIS.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11439v1
SPKLIP: Aligning Spike Video Streams with Natural Language,"Spike cameras offer unique sensing capabilities but their sparse, asynchronous output challenges semantic understanding, especially for Spike Video-Language Alignment (Spike-VLA) where models like CLIP underperform due to modality mismatch. We introduce SPKLIP, the first architecture specifically for Spike-VLA. SPKLIP employs a hierarchical spike feature extractor that adaptively models multi-scale temporal dynamics in event streams, and uses spike-text contrastive learning to directly align spike video with language, enabling effective few-shot learning. A full-spiking visual encoder variant, integrating SNN components into our pipeline, demonstrates enhanced energy efficiency. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on benchmark spike datasets and strong few-shot generalization on a newly contributed real-world dataset. SPKLIP's energy efficiency highlights its potential for neuromorphic deployment, advancing event-based multimodal research.

Use as Many Surrogates as You Want: Selective Ensemble Attack to Unleash   Transferability without Sacrificing Resource Efficiency,"In surrogate ensemble attacks, using more surrogate models yields higher transferability but lower resource efficiency. This practical trade-off between transferability and efficiency has largely limited existing attacks despite many pre-trained models are easily accessible online. In this paper, we argue that such a trade-off is caused by an unnecessary common assumption, i.e., all models should be identical across iterations. By lifting this assumption, we can use as many surrogates as we want to unleash transferability without sacrificing efficiency. Concretely, we propose Selective Ensemble Attack (SEA), which dynamically selects diverse models (from easily accessible pre-trained models) across iterations based on our new interpretation of decoupling within-iteration and cross-iteration model diversity.In this way, the number of within-iteration models is fixed for maintaining efficiency, while only cross-iteration model diversity is increased for higher transferability. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of SEA in various scenarios. For example, when dynamically selecting 4 from 20 accessible models, SEA yields 8.5% higher transferability than existing attacks under the same efficiency. The superiority of SEA also generalizes to real-world systems, such as commercial vision APIs and large vision-language models. Overall, SEA opens up the possibility of adaptively balancing transferability and efficiency according to specific resource requirements.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12644v1
EA-3DGS: Efficient and Adaptive 3D Gaussians with Highly Enhanced   Quality for outdoor scenes,"Efficient scene representations are essential for many real-world applications, especially those involving spatial measurement. Although current NeRF-based methods have achieved impressive results in reconstructing building-scale scenes, they still suffer from slow training and inference speeds due to time-consuming stochastic sampling. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated excellent performance with its high-quality rendering and real-time speed, especially for objects and small-scale scenes. However, in outdoor scenes, its point-based explicit representation lacks an effective adjustment mechanism, and the millions of Gaussian points required often lead to memory constraints during training. To address these challenges, we propose EA-3DGS, a high-quality real-time rendering method designed for outdoor scenes. First, we introduce a mesh structure to regulate the initialization of Gaussian components by leveraging an adaptive tetrahedral mesh that partitions the grid and initializes Gaussian components on each face, effectively capturing geometric structures in low-texture regions. Second, we propose an efficient Gaussian pruning strategy that evaluates each 3D Gaussian's contribution to the view and prunes accordingly. To retain geometry-critical Gaussian points, we also present a structure-aware densification strategy that densifies Gaussian points in low-curvature regions. Additionally, we employ vector quantization for parameter quantization of Gaussian components, significantly reducing disk space requirements with only a minimal impact on rendering quality. Extensive experiments on 13 scenes, including eight from four public datasets (MatrixCity-Aerial, Mill-19, Tanks \& Temples, WHU) and five self-collected scenes acquired through UAV photogrammetry measurement from SCUT-CA and plateau regions, further demonstrate the superiority of our method.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10787v1
Bayesian Deep Learning Approaches for Uncertainty-Aware Retinal OCT   Image Segmentation for Multiple Sclerosis,"Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides valuable insights in ophthalmology, cardiology, and neurology due to high-resolution, cross-sectional images of the retina. One critical task for ophthalmologists using OCT is delineation of retinal layers within scans. This process is time-consuming and prone to human bias, affecting the accuracy and reliability of diagnoses. Previous efforts to automate delineation using deep learning face challenges in uptake from clinicians and statisticians due to the absence of uncertainty estimation, leading to ""confidently wrong"" models via hallucinations. In this study, we address these challenges by applying Bayesian convolutional neural networks (BCNNs) to segment an openly available OCT imaging dataset containing 35 human retina OCTs split between healthy controls and patients with multiple sclerosis. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian models can be used to provide uncertainty maps of the segmentation, which can further be used to identify highly uncertain samples that exhibit recording artefacts such as noise or miscalibration at inference time. Our method also allows for uncertainty-estimation for important secondary measurements such as layer thicknesses, that are medically relevant for patients. We show that these features come in addition to greater performance compared to similar work over all delineations; with an overall Dice score of 95.65%. Our work brings greater clinical applicability, statistical robustness, and performance to retinal OCT segmentation.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12061v1
Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Unified Remote Sensing Dense Prediction,"The proliferation of diverse remote sensing data has spurred advancements in dense prediction tasks, yet significant challenges remain in handling data heterogeneity. Remote sensing imagery exhibits substantial variability across temporal, spectral, and spatial (TSS) dimensions, complicating unified data processing. Current deep learning models for dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation and change detection, are typically tailored to specific input-output configurations. Consequently, variations in data dimensionality or task requirements often lead to significant performance degradation or model incompatibility, necessitating costly retraining or fine-tuning efforts for different application scenarios. This paper introduces the Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Unified Network (TSSUN), a novel architecture designed for unified representation and modeling of remote sensing data across diverse TSS characteristics and task types. TSSUN employs a Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Unified Strategy that leverages meta-information to decouple and standardize input representations from varied temporal, spectral, and spatial configurations, and similarly unifies output structures for different dense prediction tasks and class numbers. Furthermore, a Local-Global Window Attention mechanism is proposed to efficiently capture both local contextual details and global dependencies, enhancing the model's adaptability and feature extraction capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that a single TSSUN model effectively adapts to heterogeneous inputs and unifies various dense prediction tasks. The proposed approach consistently achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its robustness and generalizability for complex remote sensing applications without requiring task-specific modifications.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12280v1
DIMM: Decoupled Multi-hierarchy Kalman Filter for 3D Object Tracking,"State estimation is challenging for 3D object tracking with high maneuverability, as the target's state transition function changes rapidly, irregularly, and is unknown to the estimator. Existing work based on interacting multiple model (IMM) achieves more accurate estimation than single-filter approaches through model combination, aligning appropriate models for different motion modes of the target object over time. However, two limitations of conventional IMM remain unsolved. First, the solution space of the model combination is constrained as the target's diverse kinematic properties in different directions are ignored. Second, the model combination weights calculated by the observation likelihood are not accurate enough due to the measurement uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, DIMM, to effectively combine estimates from different motion models in each direction, thus increasing the 3D object tracking accuracy. First, DIMM extends the model combination solution space of conventional IMM from a hyperplane to a hypercube by designing a 3D-decoupled multi-hierarchy filter bank, which describes the target's motion with various-order linear models. Second, DIMM generates more reliable combination weight matrices through a differentiable adaptive fusion network for importance allocation rather than solely relying on the observation likelihood; it contains an attention-based twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) method with a hierarchical reward. Experiments demonstrate that DIMM significantly improves the tracking accuracy of existing state estimation methods by 31.61%~99.23%.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12340v1
Safe-Sora: Safe Text-to-Video Generation via Graphical Watermarking,"The explosive growth of generative video models has amplified the demand for reliable copyright preservation of AI-generated content. Despite its popularity in image synthesis, invisible generative watermarking remains largely underexplored in video generation. To address this gap, we propose Safe-Sora, the first framework to embed graphical watermarks directly into the video generation process. Motivated by the observation that watermarking performance is closely tied to the visual similarity between the watermark and cover content, we introduce a hierarchical coarse-to-fine adaptive matching mechanism. Specifically, the watermark image is divided into patches, each assigned to the most visually similar video frame, and further localized to the optimal spatial region for seamless embedding. To enable spatiotemporal fusion of watermark patches across video frames, we develop a 3D wavelet transform-enhanced Mamba architecture with a novel spatiotemporal local scanning strategy, effectively modeling long-range dependencies during watermark embedding and retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply state space models to watermarking, opening new avenues for efficient and robust watermark protection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Safe-Sora achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of video quality, watermark fidelity, and robustness, which is largely attributed to our proposals. We will release our code upon publication.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12667v1
Cross-Model Transfer of Task Vectors via Few-Shot Orthogonal Alignment,"Task arithmetic enables efficient model editing by representing task-specific changes as vectors in parameter space. Task arithmetic typically assumes that the source and target models are initialized from the same pre-trained parameters. This assumption limits its applicability in cross-model transfer settings, where models are independently pre-trained on different datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a method based on few-shot orthogonal alignment, which aligns task vectors to the parameter space of a differently pre-trained target model. These transformations preserve key properties of task vectors, such as norm and rank, and are learned using only a small number of labeled examples. We evaluate the method using two Vision Transformers pre-trained on YFCC100M and LAION400M, and test on eight classification datasets. Experimental results show that our method improves transfer accuracy over direct task vector application and achieves performance comparable to few-shot fine-tuning, while maintaining the modularity and reusability of task vectors. Our code is available at https://github.com/kawakera-lab/CrossModelTransfer.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12021v1
Imputation-free and Alignment-free: Incomplete Multi-view Clustering   Driven by Consensus Semantic Learning,"In incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC), missing data induce prototype shifts within views and semantic inconsistencies across views. A feasible solution is to explore cross-view consistency in paired complete observations, further imputing and aligning the similarity relationships inherently shared across views. Nevertheless, existing methods are constrained by two-tiered limitations: (1) Neither instance- nor cluster-level consistency learning construct a semantic space shared across views to learn consensus semantics. The former enforces cross-view instances alignment, and wrongly regards unpaired observations with semantic consistency as negative pairs; the latter focuses on cross-view cluster counterparts while coarsely handling fine-grained intra-cluster relationships within views. (2) Excessive reliance on consistency results in unreliable imputation and alignment without incorporating view-specific cluster information. Thus, we propose an IMVC framework, imputation- and alignment-free for consensus semantics learning (FreeCSL). To bridge semantic gaps across all observations, we learn consensus prototypes from available data to discover a shared space, where semantically similar observations are pulled closer for consensus semantics learning. To capture semantic relationships within specific views, we design a heuristic graph clustering based on modularity to recover cluster structure with intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster separation for cluster semantics enhancement. Extensive experiments demonstrate, compared to state-of-the-art competitors, FreeCSL achieves more confident and robust assignments on IMVC task.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11182v1
MFogHub: Bridging Multi-Regional and Multi-Satellite Data for Global   Marine Fog Detection and Forecasting,"Deep learning approaches for marine fog detection and forecasting have outperformed traditional methods, demonstrating significant scientific and practical importance. However, the limited availability of open-source datasets remains a major challenge. Existing datasets, often focused on a single region or satellite, restrict the ability to evaluate model performance across diverse conditions and hinder the exploration of intrinsic marine fog characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{MFogHub}, the first multi-regional and multi-satellite dataset to integrate annotated marine fog observations from 15 coastal fog-prone regions and six geostationary satellites, comprising over 68,000 high-resolution samples. By encompassing diverse regions and satellite perspectives, MFogHub facilitates rigorous evaluation of both detection and forecasting methods under varying conditions. Extensive experiments with 16 baseline models demonstrate that MFogHub can reveal generalization fluctuations due to regional and satellite discrepancy, while also serving as a valuable resource for the development of targeted and scalable fog prediction techniques. Through MFogHub, we aim to advance both the practical monitoring and scientific understanding of marine fog dynamics on a global scale.

MMLongBench: Benchmarking Long-Context Vision-Language Models   Effectively and Thoroughly,"The rapid extension of context windows in large vision-language models has given rise to long-context vision-language models (LCVLMs), which are capable of handling hundreds of images with interleaved text tokens in a single forward pass. In this work, we introduce MMLongBench, the first benchmark covering a diverse set of long-context vision-language tasks, to evaluate LCVLMs effectively and thoroughly. MMLongBench is composed of 13,331 examples spanning five different categories of downstream tasks, such as Visual RAG and Many-Shot ICL. It also provides broad coverage of image types, including various natural and synthetic images. To assess the robustness of the models to different input lengths, all examples are delivered at five standardized input lengths (8K-128K tokens) via a cross-modal tokenization scheme that combines vision patches and text tokens. Through a thorough benchmarking of 46 closed-source and open-source LCVLMs, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current models' vision-language long-context ability. Our results show that: i) performance on a single task is a weak proxy for overall long-context capability; ii) both closed-source and open-source models face challenges in long-context vision-language tasks, indicating substantial room for future improvement; iii) models with stronger reasoning ability tend to exhibit better long-context performance. By offering wide task coverage, various image types, and rigorous length control, MMLongBench provides the missing foundation for diagnosing and advancing the next generation of LCVLMs.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10610v1
Pyramid Sparse Transformer: Enhancing Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with   Dynamic Token Selection,"Feature fusion is critical for high-performance vision models but often incurs prohibitive complexity. However, prevailing attention-based fusion methods often involve significant computational complexity and implementation challenges, limiting their efficiency in resource-constrained environments. To address these issues, we introduce the Pyramid Sparse Transformer (PST), a lightweight, plug-and-play module that integrates coarse-to-fine token selection and shared attention parameters to reduce computation while preserving spatial detail. PST can be trained using only coarse attention and seamlessly activated at inference for further accuracy gains without retraining. When added to state-of-the-art real-time detection models, such as YOLOv11-N/S/M, PST yields mAP improvements of 0.9%, 0.5%, and 0.4% on MS COCO with minimal latency impact. Likewise, embedding PST into ResNet-18/50/101 as backbones, boosts ImageNet top-1 accuracy by 6.5%, 1.7%, and 1.0%, respectively. These results demonstrate PST's effectiveness as a simple, hardware-friendly enhancement for both detection and classification tasks.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12772v1
HumaniBench: A Human-Centric Framework for Large Multimodal Models   Evaluation,"Large multimodal models (LMMs) now excel on many vision language benchmarks, however, they still struggle with human centered criteria such as fairness, ethics, empathy, and inclusivity, key to aligning with human values. We introduce HumaniBench, a holistic benchmark of 32K real-world image question pairs, annotated via a scalable GPT4o assisted pipeline and exhaustively verified by domain experts. HumaniBench evaluates seven Human Centered AI (HCAI) principles: fairness, ethics, understanding, reasoning, language inclusivity, empathy, and robustness, across seven diverse tasks, including open and closed ended visual question answering (VQA), multilingual QA, visual grounding, empathetic captioning, and robustness tests. Benchmarking 15 state of the art LMMs (open and closed source) reveals that proprietary models generally lead, though robustness and visual grounding remain weak points.

Rethinking Features-Fused-Pyramid-Neck for Object Detection,"Multi-head detectors typically employ a features-fused-pyramid-neck for multi-scale detection and are widely adopted in the industry. However, this approach faces feature misalignment when representations from different hierarchical levels of the feature pyramid are forcibly fused point-to-point. To address this issue, we designed an independent hierarchy pyramid (IHP) architecture to evaluate the effectiveness of the features-unfused-pyramid-neck for multi-head detectors. Subsequently, we introduced soft nearest neighbor interpolation (SNI) with a weight downscaling factor to mitigate the impact of feature fusion at different hierarchies while preserving key textures. Furthermore, we present a features adaptive selection method for down sampling in extended spatial windows (ESD) to retain spatial features and enhance lightweight convolutional techniques (GSConvE). These advancements culminate in our secondary features alignment solution (SA) for real-time detection, achieving state-of-the-art results on Pascal VOC and MS COCO. Code will be released at https://github.com/AlanLi1997/rethinking-fpn. This paper has been accepted by ECCV2024 and published on Springer Nature.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12820v1
Hybrid-Emba3D: Geometry-Aware and Cross-Path Feature Hybrid Enhanced   State Space Model for Point Cloud Classification,"The point cloud classification tasks face the dual challenge of efficiently extracting local geometric features while maintaining model complexity. The Mamba architecture utilizes the linear complexity advantage of state space models (SSMs) to overcome the computational bottleneck of Transformers while balancing global modeling capabilities. However, the inherent contradiction between its unidirectional dependency and the unordered nature of point clouds impedes modeling spatial correlation in local neighborhoods, thus constraining geometric feature extraction. This paper proposes Hybrid-Emba3D, a bidirectional Mamba model enhanced by geometry-feature coupling and cross-path feature hybridization. The Local geometric pooling with geometry-feature coupling mechanism significantly enhances local feature discriminative power via coordinated propagation and dynamic aggregation of geometric information between local center points and their neighborhoods, without introducing additional parameters. The designed Collaborative feature enhancer adopts dual-path hybridization, effectively handling local mutations and sparse key signals, breaking through the limitations of traditional SSM long-range modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a new SOTA classification accuracy of 95.99% on ModelNet40 with only 0.03M additional.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11099v1
Event-based Star Tracking under Spacecraft Jitter: the e-STURT Dataset,"Jitter degrades a spacecraft's fine-pointing ability required for optical communication, earth observation, and space domain awareness. Development of jitter estimation and compensation algorithms requires high-fidelity sensor observations representative of on-board jitter. In this work, we present the Event-based Star Tracking Under Jitter (e-STURT) dataset -- the first event camera based dataset of star observations under controlled jitter conditions. Specialized hardware employed for the dataset emulates an event-camera undergoing on-board jitter. While the event camera provides asynchronous, high temporal resolution star observations, systematic and repeatable jitter is introduced using a micrometer accurate piezoelectric actuator. Various jitter sources are simulated using distinct frequency bands and utilizing both axes of motion. Ground-truth jitter is captured in hardware from the piezoelectric actuator. The resulting dataset consists of 200 sequences and is made publicly available. This work highlights the dataset generation process, technical challenges and the resulting limitations. To serve as a baseline, we propose a high-frequency jitter estimation algorithm that operates directly on the event stream. The e-STURT dataset will enable the development of jitter aware algorithms for mission critical event-based space sensing applications.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12588v1
Visual Planning: Let's Think Only with Images,"Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) have substantially enhanced machine reasoning across diverse tasks. However, these models predominantly rely on pure text as the medium for both expressing and structuring reasoning, even when visual information is present. In this work, we argue that language may not always be the most natural or effective modality for reasoning, particularly in tasks involving spatial and geometrical information. Motivated by this, we propose a new paradigm, Visual Planning, which enables planning through purely visual representations, independent of text. In this paradigm, planning is executed via sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual domain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement Learning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models, leading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of representative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our visual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct reasoning in the text-only space. Our results establish Visual Planning as a viable and promising alternative to language-based reasoning, opening new avenues for tasks that benefit from intuitive, image-based inference.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11409v1
TartanGround: A Large-Scale Dataset for Ground Robot Perception and   Navigation,"We present TartanGround, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset to advance the perception and autonomy of ground robots operating in diverse environments. This dataset, collected in various photorealistic simulation environments includes multiple RGB stereo cameras for 360-degree coverage, along with depth, optical flow, stereo disparity, LiDAR point clouds, ground truth poses, semantic segmented images, and occupancy maps with semantic labels. Data is collected using an integrated automatic pipeline, which generates trajectories mimicking the motion patterns of various ground robot platforms, including wheeled and legged robots. We collect 910 trajectories across 70 environments, resulting in 1.5 million samples. Evaluations on occupancy prediction and SLAM tasks reveal that state-of-the-art methods trained on existing datasets struggle to generalize across diverse scenes. TartanGround can serve as a testbed for training and evaluation of a broad range of learning-based tasks, including occupancy prediction, SLAM, neural scene representation, perception-based navigation, and more, enabling advancements in robotic perception and autonomy towards achieving robust models generalizable to more diverse scenarios. The dataset and codebase for data collection will be made publicly available upon acceptance. Webpage: https://tartanair.org/tartanground",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10696v1
VGGT-SLAM: Dense RGB SLAM Optimized on the SL(4) Manifold,"We present VGGT-SLAM, a dense RGB SLAM system constructed by incrementally and globally aligning submaps created from the feed-forward scene reconstruction approach VGGT using only uncalibrated monocular cameras. While related works align submaps using similarity transforms (i.e., translation, rotation, and scale), we show that such approaches are inadequate in the case of uncalibrated cameras. In particular, we revisit the idea of reconstruction ambiguity, where given a set of uncalibrated cameras with no assumption on the camera motion or scene structure, the scene can only be reconstructed up to a 15-degrees-of-freedom projective transformation of the true geometry. This inspires us to recover a consistent scene reconstruction across submaps by optimizing over the SL(4) manifold, thus estimating 15-degrees-of-freedom homography transforms between sequential submaps while accounting for potential loop closure constraints. As verified by extensive experiments, we demonstrate that VGGT-SLAM achieves improved map quality using long video sequences that are infeasible for VGGT due to its high GPU requirements.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12549v1
HiERO: understanding the hierarchy of human behavior enhances reasoning   on egocentric videos,"Human activities are particularly complex and variable, and this makes challenging for deep learning models to reason about them. However, we note that such variability does have an underlying structure, composed of a hierarchy of patterns of related actions. We argue that such structure can emerge naturally from unscripted videos of human activities, and can be leveraged to better reason about their content. We present HiERO, a weakly-supervised method to enrich video segments features with the corresponding hierarchical activity threads. By aligning video clips with their narrated descriptions, HiERO infers contextual, semantic and temporal reasoning with an hierarchical architecture. We prove the potential of our enriched features with multiple video-text alignment benchmarks (EgoMCQ, EgoNLQ) with minimal additional training, and in zero-shot for procedure learning tasks (EgoProceL and Ego4D Goal-Step). Notably, HiERO achieves state-of-the-art performance in all the benchmarks, and for procedure learning tasks it outperforms fully-supervised methods by a large margin (+12.5% F1 on EgoProceL) in zero shot. Our results prove the relevance of using knowledge of the hierarchy of human activities for multiple reasoning tasks in egocentric vision.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12911v1
Joint Depth and Reflectivity Estimation using Single-Photon LiDAR,"Single-Photon Light Detection and Ranging (SP-LiDAR is emerging as a leading technology for long-range, high-precision 3D vision tasks. In SP-LiDAR, timestamps encode two complementary pieces of information: pulse travel time (depth) and the number of photons reflected by the object (reflectivity). Existing SP-LiDAR reconstruction methods typically recover depth and reflectivity separately or sequentially use one modality to estimate the other. Moreover, the conventional 3D histogram construction is effective mainly for slow-moving or stationary scenes. In dynamic scenes, however, it is more efficient and effective to directly process the timestamps. In this paper, we introduce an estimation method to simultaneously recover both depth and reflectivity in fast-moving scenes. We offer two contributions: (1) A theoretical analysis demonstrating the mutual correlation between depth and reflectivity and the conditions under which joint estimation becomes beneficial. (2) A novel reconstruction method, ""SPLiDER"", which exploits the shared information to enhance signal recovery. On both synthetic and real SP-LiDAR data, our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior joint reconstruction quality.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13250v1
Understanding Complexity in VideoQA via Visual Program Generation,"We propose a data-driven approach to analyzing query complexity in Video Question Answering (VideoQA). Previous efforts in benchmark design have relied on human expertise to design challenging questions, yet we experimentally show that humans struggle to predict which questions are difficult for machine learning models. Our automatic approach leverages recent advances in code generation for visual question answering, using the complexity of generated code as a proxy for question difficulty. We demonstrate that this measure correlates significantly better with model performance than human estimates. To operationalize this insight, we propose an algorithm for estimating question complexity from code. It identifies fine-grained primitives that correlate with the hardest questions for any given set of models, making it easy to scale to new approaches in the future. Finally, to further illustrate the utility of our method, we extend it to automatically generate complex questions, constructing a new benchmark that is 1.9 times harder than the popular NExT-QA.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13429v1
CUBIC: Concept Embeddings for Unsupervised Bias Identification using   VLMs,"Deep vision models often rely on biases learned from spurious correlations in datasets. To identify these biases, methods that interpret high-level, human-understandable concepts are more effective than those relying primarily on low-level features like heatmaps. A major challenge for these concept-based methods is the lack of image annotations indicating potentially bias-inducing concepts, since creating such annotations requires detailed labeling for each dataset and concept, which is highly labor-intensive. We present CUBIC (Concept embeddings for Unsupervised Bias IdentifiCation), a novel method that automatically discovers interpretable concepts that may bias classifier behavior. Unlike existing approaches, CUBIC does not rely on predefined bias candidates or examples of model failures tied to specific biases, as such information is not always available. Instead, it leverages image-text latent space and linear classifier probes to examine how the latent representation of a superclass label$\unicode{x2014}$shared by all instances in the dataset$\unicode{x2014}$is influenced by the presence of a given concept. By measuring these shifts against the normal vector to the classifier's decision boundary, CUBIC identifies concepts that significantly influence model predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that CUBIC effectively uncovers previously unknown biases using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without requiring the samples in the dataset where the classifier underperforms or prior knowledge of potential biases.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11060v1
RefPose: Leveraging Reference Geometric Correspondences for Accurate 6D   Pose Estimation of Unseen Objects,"Estimating the 6D pose of unseen objects from monocular RGB images remains a challenging problem, especially due to the lack of prior object-specific knowledge. To tackle this issue, we propose RefPose, an innovative approach to object pose estimation that leverages a reference image and geometric correspondence as guidance. RefPose first predicts an initial pose by using object templates to render the reference image and establish the geometric correspondence needed for the refinement stage. During the refinement stage, RefPose estimates the geometric correspondence of the query based on the generated references and iteratively refines the pose through a render-and-compare approach. To enhance this estimation, we introduce a correlation volume-guided attention mechanism that effectively captures correlations between the query and reference images. Unlike traditional methods that depend on pre-defined object models, RefPose dynamically adapts to new object shapes by leveraging a reference image and geometric correspondence. This results in robust performance across previously unseen objects. Extensive evaluation on the BOP benchmark datasets shows that RefPose achieves state-of-the-art results while maintaining a competitive runtime.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10841v1
ForensicHub: A Unified Benchmark & Codebase for All-Domain Fake Image   Detection and Localization,"The field of Fake Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) is highly fragmented, encompassing four domains: deepfake detection (Deepfake), image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL), artificial intelligence-generated image detection (AIGC), and document image manipulation localization (Doc). Although individual benchmarks exist in some domains, a unified benchmark for all domains in FIDL remains blank. The absence of a unified benchmark results in significant domain silos, where each domain independently constructs its datasets, models, and evaluation protocols without interoperability, preventing cross-domain comparisons and hindering the development of the entire FIDL field. To close the domain silo barrier, we propose ForensicHub, the first unified benchmark & codebase for all-domain fake image detection and localization. Considering drastic variations on dataset, model, and evaluation configurations across all domains, as well as the scarcity of open-sourced baseline models and the lack of individual benchmarks in some domains, ForensicHub: i) proposes a modular and configuration-driven architecture that decomposes forensic pipelines into interchangeable components across datasets, transforms, models, and evaluators, allowing flexible composition across all domains; ii) fully implements 10 baseline models, 6 backbones, 2 new benchmarks for AIGC and Doc, and integrates 2 existing benchmarks of DeepfakeBench and IMDLBenCo through an adapter-based design; iii) conducts indepth analysis based on the ForensicHub, offering 8 key actionable insights into FIDL model architecture, dataset characteristics, and evaluation standards. ForensicHub represents a significant leap forward in breaking the domain silos in the FIDL field and inspiring future breakthroughs.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11003v1
Towards Robust Spiking Neural Networks:Mitigating Heterogeneous Training   Vulnerability via Dominant Eigencomponent Projection,"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) process information via discrete spikes, enabling them to operate at remarkably low energy levels. However, our experimental observations reveal a striking vulnerability when SNNs are trained using the mainstream method--direct encoding combined with backpropagation through time (BPTT): even a single backward pass on data drawn from a slightly different distribution can lead to catastrophic network collapse. Our theoretical analysis attributes this vulnerability to the repeated inputs inherent in direct encoding and the gradient accumulation characteristic of BPTT, which together produce an exceptional large Hessian spectral radius. To address this challenge, we develop a hyperparameter-free method called Dominant Eigencomponent Projection (DEP). By orthogonally projecting gradients to precisely remove their dominant components, DEP effectively reduces the Hessian spectral radius, thereby preventing SNNs from settling into sharp minima. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DEP not only mitigates the vulnerability of SNNs to heterogeneous data poisoning, but also significantly enhances overall robustness compared to key baselines, providing strong support for safer and more reliable SNN deployment.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11134v1
Diffusion Model in Hyperspectral Image Processing and Analysis: A Review,"Hyperspectral image processing and analysis has important application value in remote sensing, agriculture and environmental monitoring, but its high dimensionality, data redundancy and noise interference etc. bring great challenges to the analysis. Traditional models have limitations in dealing with these complex data, and it is difficult to meet the increasing demand for analysis. In recent years, Diffusion Model, as an emerging generative model, has shown unique advantages in hyperspectral image processing. By simulating the diffusion process of data in time, the Diffusion Model can effectively process high-dimensional data, generate high-quality samples, and perform well in denoising and data enhancement. In this paper, we review the recent research advances in diffusion modeling for hyperspectral image processing and analysis, and discuss its applications in tasks such as high-dimensional data processing, noise removal, classification, and anomaly detection. The performance of diffusion-based models on image processing is compared and the challenges are summarized. It is shown that the diffusion model can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of hyperspectral image analysis, providing a new direction for future research.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11158v1
"Generative Models in Computational Pathology: A Comprehensive Survey on   Methods, Applications, and Challenges","Generative modeling has emerged as a promising direction in computational pathology, offering capabilities such as data-efficient learning, synthetic data augmentation, and multimodal representation across diverse diagnostic tasks. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent progress in the field, organized into four key domains: image generation, text generation, multimodal image-text generation, and other generative applications, including spatial simulation and molecular inference. By analyzing over 150 representative studies, we trace the evolution of generative architectures from early generative adversarial networks to recent advances in diffusion models and foundation models with generative capabilities. We further examine the datasets and evaluation protocols commonly used in this domain and highlight ongoing limitations, including challenges in generating high-fidelity whole slide images, clinical interpretability, and concerns related to the ethical and legal implications of synthetic data. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges and prospective research directions, with an emphasis on developing unified, multimodal, and clinically deployable generative systems. This work aims to provide a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners developing and applying generative models in computational pathology.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10993v1
FLASH: Latent-Aware Semi-Autoregressive Speculative Decoding for   Multimodal Tasks,"Large language and multimodal models (LLMs and LMMs) exhibit strong inference capabilities but are often limited by slow decoding speeds. This challenge is especially acute in LMMs, where visual inputs typically comprise more tokens with lower information density than text -- an issue exacerbated by recent trends toward finer-grained visual tokenizations to boost performance. Speculative decoding has been effective in accelerating LLM inference by using a smaller draft model to generate candidate tokens, which are then selectively verified by the target model, improving speed without sacrificing output quality. While this strategy has been extended to LMMs, existing methods largely overlook the unique properties of visual inputs and depend solely on text-based draft models. In this work, we propose \textbf{FLASH} (Fast Latent-Aware Semi-Autoregressive Heuristics), a speculative decoding framework designed specifically for LMMs, which leverages two key properties of multimodal data to design the draft model. First, to address redundancy in visual tokens, we propose a lightweight latent-aware token compression mechanism. Second, recognizing that visual objects often co-occur within a scene, we employ a semi-autoregressive decoding strategy to generate multiple tokens per forward pass. These innovations accelerate draft decoding while maintaining high acceptance rates, resulting in faster overall inference. Experiments show that FLASH significantly outperforms prior speculative decoding approaches in both unimodal and multimodal settings, achieving up to \textbf{2.68$\times$} speed-up on video captioning and \textbf{2.55$\times$} on visual instruction tuning tasks compared to the original LMM.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12728v1
MonoMobility: Zero-Shot 3D Mobility Analysis from Monocular Videos,"Accurately analyzing the motion parts and their motion attributes in dynamic environments is crucial for advancing key areas such as embodied intelligence. Addressing the limitations of existing methods that rely on dense multi-view images or detailed part-level annotations, we propose an innovative framework that can analyze 3D mobility from monocular videos in a zero-shot manner. This framework can precisely parse motion parts and motion attributes only using a monocular video, completely eliminating the need for annotated training data. Specifically, our method first constructs the scene geometry and roughly analyzes the motion parts and their initial motion attributes combining depth estimation, optical flow analysis and point cloud registration method, then employs 2D Gaussian splatting for scene representation. Building on this, we introduce an end-to-end dynamic scene optimization algorithm specifically designed for articulated objects, refining the initial analysis results to ensure the system can handle 'rotation', 'translation', and even complex movements ('rotation+translation'), demonstrating high flexibility and versatility. To validate the robustness and wide applicability of our method, we created a comprehensive dataset comprising both simulated and real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that our framework can effectively analyze articulated object motions in an annotation-free manner, showcasing its significant potential in future embodied intelligence applications.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11868v1
FEALLM: Advancing Facial Emotion Analysis in Multimodal Large Language   Models with Emotional Synergy and Reasoning,"Facial Emotion Analysis (FEA) plays a crucial role in visual affective computing, aiming to infer a person's emotional state based on facial data. Scientifically, facial expressions (FEs) result from the coordinated movement of facial muscles, which can be decomposed into specific action units (AUs) that provide detailed emotional insights. However, traditional methods often struggle with limited interpretability, constrained generalization and reasoning abilities. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional performance in various visual tasks, while they still face significant challenges in FEA due to the lack of specialized datasets and their inability to capture the intricate relationships between FEs and AUs. To address these issues, we introduce a novel FEA Instruction Dataset that provides accurate and aligned FE and AU descriptions and establishes causal reasoning relationships between them, followed by constructing a new benchmark, FEABench. Moreover, we propose FEALLM, a novel MLLM architecture designed to capture more detailed facial information, enhancing its capability in FEA tasks. Our model demonstrates strong performance on FEABench and impressive generalization capability through zero-shot evaluation on various datasets, including RAF-DB, AffectNet, BP4D, and DISFA, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in FEA tasks. The dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/953206211/FEALLM.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13419v1
PoseBench3D: A Cross-Dataset Analysis Framework for 3D Human Pose   Estimation,"Reliable three-dimensional human pose estimation is becoming increasingly important for real-world applications, yet much of prior work has focused solely on the performance within a single dataset. In practice, however, systems must adapt to diverse viewpoints, environments, and camera setups -- conditions that differ significantly from those encountered during training, which is often the case in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we present a standardized testing environment in which each method is evaluated on a variety of datasets, ensuring consistent and fair cross-dataset comparisons -- allowing for the analysis of methods on previously unseen data. Therefore, we propose PoseBench3D, a unified framework designed to systematically re-evaluate prior and future models across four of the most widely used datasets for human pose estimation -- with the framework able to support novel and future datasets as the field progresses. Through a unified interface, our framework provides datasets in a pre-configured yet easily modifiable format, ensuring compatibility with diverse model architectures. We re-evaluated the work of 18 methods, either trained or gathered from existing literature, and reported results using both Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) and Procrustes Aligned Mean Per Joint Position Error (PA-MPJPE) metrics, yielding more than 100 novel cross-dataset evaluation results. Additionally, we analyze performance differences resulting from various pre-processing techniques and dataset preparation parameters -- offering further insight into model generalization capabilities.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10888v1
NOFT: Test-Time Noise Finetune via Information Bottleneck for Highly   Correlated Asset Creation,"The diffusion model has provided a strong tool for implementing text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation. Recently, topology and texture control are popular explorations, e.g., ControlNet, IP-Adapter, Ctrl-X, and DSG. These methods explicitly consider high-fidelity controllable editing based on external signals or diffusion feature manipulations. As for diversity, they directly choose different noise latents. However, the diffused noise is capable of implicitly representing the topological and textural manifold of the corresponding image. Moreover, it's an effective workbench to conduct the trade-off between content preservation and controllable variations. Previous T2I and I2I diffusion works do not explore the information within the compressed contextual latent. In this paper, we first propose a plug-and-play noise finetune NOFT module employed by Stable Diffusion to generate highly correlated and diverse images. We fine-tune seed noise or inverse noise through an optimal-transported (OT) information bottleneck (IB) with around only 14K trainable parameters and 10 minutes of training. Our test-time NOFT is good at producing high-fidelity image variations considering topology and texture alignments. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NOFT is a powerful general reimagine approach to efficiently fine-tune the 2D/3D AIGC assets with text or image guidance.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12235v1
CTLformer: A Hybrid Denoising Model Combining Convolutional Layers and   Self-Attention for Enhanced CT Image Reconstruction,"Low-dose CT (LDCT) images are often accompanied by significant noise, which negatively impacts image quality and subsequent diagnostic accuracy. To address the challenges of multi-scale feature fusion and diverse noise distribution patterns in LDCT denoising, this paper introduces an innovative model, CTLformer, which combines convolutional structures with transformer architecture. Two key innovations are proposed: a multi-scale attention mechanism and a dynamic attention control mechanism. The multi-scale attention mechanism, implemented through the Token2Token mechanism and self-attention interaction modules, effectively captures both fine details and global structures at different scales, enhancing relevant features and suppressing noise. The dynamic attention control mechanism adapts the attention distribution based on the noise characteristics of the input image, focusing on high-noise regions while preserving details in low-noise areas, thereby enhancing robustness and improving denoising performance. Furthermore, CTLformer integrates convolutional layers for efficient feature extraction and uses overlapping inference to mitigate boundary artifacts, further strengthening its denoising capability. Experimental results on the 2016 National Institutes of Health AAPM Mayo Clinic LDCT Challenge dataset demonstrate that CTLformer significantly outperforms existing methods in both denoising performance and model efficiency, greatly improving the quality of LDCT images. The proposed CTLformer not only provides an efficient solution for LDCT denoising but also shows broad potential in medical image analysis, especially for clinical applications dealing with complex noise patterns.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12203v1
Mitigating Hallucination in VideoLLMs via Temporal-Aware Activation   Engineering,"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding.However, hallucination, where the model generates plausible yet incorrect outputs, persists as a significant and under-addressed challenge in the video domain. Among existing solutions, activation engineering has proven successful in mitigating hallucinations in LLMs and ImageLLMs, yet its applicability to VideoLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we are the first to systematically investigate the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of activation engineering for mitigating hallucinations in VideoLLMs. We initially conduct an investigation of the key factors affecting the performance of activation engineering and find that a model's sensitivity to hallucination depends on $\textbf{temporal variation}$ rather than task type. Moreover, selecting appropriate internal modules and dataset for activation engineering is critical for reducing hallucination. Guided by these findings, we propose a temporal-aware activation engineering framework for VideoLLMs, which adaptively identifies and manipulates hallucination-sensitive modules based on the temporal variation characteristic, substantially mitigating hallucinations without additional LLM fine-tuning. Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our method markedly reduces hallucination in VideoLLMs, thereby validating the robustness of our findings.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12826v1
PhiNet v2: A Mask-Free Brain-Inspired Vision Foundation Model from Video,"Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have revolutionized computer vision through innovative architectures and learning objectives, yet they have not fully leveraged insights from biological visual processing systems. Recently, a brain-inspired SSL model named PhiNet was proposed; it is based on a ResNet backbone and operates on static image inputs with strong augmentation. In this paper, we introduce PhiNet v2, a novel Transformer-based architecture that processes temporal visual input (that is, sequences of images) without relying on strong augmentation. Our model leverages variational inference to learn robust visual representations from continuous input streams, similar to human visual processing. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that PhiNet v2 achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art vision foundation models, while maintaining the ability to learn from sequential input without strong data augmentation. This work represents a significant step toward more biologically plausible computer vision systems that process visual information in a manner more closely aligned with human cognitive processes.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11129v1
Towards Robust and Controllable Text-to-Motion via Masked Autoregressive   Diffusion,"Generating 3D human motion from text descriptions remains challenging due to the diverse and complex nature of human motion. While existing methods excel within the training distribution, they often struggle with out-of-distribution motions, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Existing VQVAE-based methods often fail to represent novel motions faithfully using discrete tokens, which hampers their ability to generalize beyond seen data. Meanwhile, diffusion-based methods operating on continuous representations often lack fine-grained control over individual frames. To address these challenges, we propose a robust motion generation framework MoMADiff, which combines masked modeling with diffusion processes to generate motion using frame-level continuous representations. Our model supports flexible user-provided keyframe specification, enabling precise control over both spatial and temporal aspects of motion synthesis. MoMADiff demonstrates strong generalization capability on novel text-to-motion datasets with sparse keyframes as motion prompts. Extensive experiments on two held-out datasets and two standard benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in motion quality, instruction fidelity, and keyframe adherence.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11013v1
Accelerate TarFlow Sampling with GS-Jacobi Iteration,"Image generation models have achieved widespread applications. As an instance, the TarFlow model combines the transformer architecture with Normalizing Flow models, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks. However, due to the causal form of attention requiring sequential computation, TarFlow's sampling process is extremely slow. In this paper, we demonstrate that through a series of optimization strategies, TarFlow sampling can be greatly accelerated by using the Gauss-Seidel-Jacobi (abbreviated as GS-Jacobi) iteration method. Specifically, we find that blocks in the TarFlow model have varying importance: a small number of blocks play a major role in image generation tasks, while other blocks contribute relatively little; some blocks are sensitive to initial values and prone to numerical overflow, while others are relatively robust. Based on these two characteristics, we propose the Convergence Ranking Metric (CRM) and the Initial Guessing Metric (IGM): CRM is used to identify whether a TarFlow block is ""simple"" (converges in few iterations) or ""tough"" (requires more iterations); IGM is used to evaluate whether the initial value of the iteration is good. Experiments on four TarFlow models demonstrate that GS-Jacobi sampling can significantly enhance sampling efficiency while maintaining the quality of generated images (measured by FID), achieving speed-ups of 4.53x in Img128cond, 5.32x in AFHQ, 2.96x in Img64uncond, and 2.51x in Img64cond without degrading FID scores or sample quality.

GlobalGeoTree: A Multi-Granular Vision-Language Dataset for Global Tree   Species Classification,"Global tree species mapping using remote sensing data is vital for biodiversity monitoring, forest management, and ecological research. However, progress in this field has been constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, labeled datasets. To address this, we introduce GlobalGeoTree, a comprehensive global dataset for tree species classification. GlobalGeoTree comprises 6.3 million geolocated tree occurrences, spanning 275 families, 2,734 genera, and 21,001 species across the hierarchical taxonomic levels. Each sample is paired with Sentinel-2 image time series and 27 auxiliary environmental variables, encompassing bioclimatic, geographic, and soil data. The dataset is partitioned into GlobalGeoTree-6M for model pretraining and curated evaluation subsets, primarily GlobalGeoTree-10kEval for zero-shot and few-shot benchmarking. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we introduce a baseline model, GeoTreeCLIP, which leverages paired remote sensing data and taxonomic text labels within a vision-language framework pretrained on GlobalGeoTree-6M. Experimental results show that GeoTreeCLIP achieves substantial improvements in zero- and few-shot classification on GlobalGeoTree-10kEval over existing advanced models. By making the dataset, models, and code publicly available, we aim to establish a benchmark to advance tree species classification and foster innovation in biodiversity research and ecological applications.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12513v1
GrowSplat: Constructing Temporal Digital Twins of Plants with Gaussian   Splats,"Accurate temporal reconstructions of plant growth are essential for plant phenotyping and breeding, yet remain challenging due to complex geometries, occlusions, and non-rigid deformations of plants. We present a novel framework for building temporal digital twins of plants by combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with a robust sample alignment pipeline. Our method begins by reconstructing Gaussian Splats from multi-view camera data, then leverages a two-stage registration approach: coarse alignment through feature-based matching and Fast Global Registration, followed by fine alignment with Iterative Closest Point. This pipeline yields a consistent 4D model of plant development in discrete time steps. We evaluate the approach on data from the Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Center, demonstrating detailed temporal reconstructions of Sequoia and Quinoa species.

AW-GATCN: Adaptive Weighted Graph Attention Convolutional Network for   Event Camera Data Joint Denoising and Object Recognition,"Event cameras, which capture brightness changes with high temporal resolution, inherently generate a significant amount of redundant and noisy data beyond essential object structures. The primary challenge in event-based object recognition lies in effectively removing this noise without losing critical spatial-temporal information. To address this, we propose an Adaptive Graph-based Noisy Data Removal framework for Event-based Object Recognition. Specifically, our approach integrates adaptive event segmentation based on normalized density analysis, a multifactorial edge-weighting mechanism, and adaptive graph-based denoising strategies. These innovations significantly enhance the integration of spatiotemporal information, effectively filtering noise while preserving critical structural features for robust recognition. Experimental evaluations on four challenging datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior recognition accuracies of 83.77%, 76.79%, 99.30%, and 96.89%, surpassing existing graph-based methods by up to 8.79%, and improving noise reduction performance by up to 19.57%, with an additional accuracy gain of 6.26% compared to traditional Euclidean-based techniques.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11232v1
Multi-Resolution Haar Network: Enhancing human motion prediction via   Haar transform,"The 3D human pose is vital for modern computer vision and computer graphics, and its prediction has drawn attention in recent years. 3D human pose prediction aims at forecasting a human's future motion from the previous sequence. Ignoring that the arbitrariness of human motion sequences has a firm origin in transition in both temporal and spatial axes limits the performance of state-of-the-art methods, leading them to struggle with making precise predictions on complex cases, e.g., arbitrarily posing or greeting. To alleviate this problem, a network called HaarMoDic is proposed in this paper, which utilizes the 2D Haar transform to project joints to higher resolution coordinates where the network can access spatial and temporal information simultaneously. An ablation study proves that the significant contributing module within the HaarModic Network is the Multi-Resolution Haar (MR-Haar) block. Instead of mining in one of two axes or extracting separately, the MR-Haar block projects whole motion sequences to a mixed-up coordinate in higher resolution with 2D Haar Transform, allowing the network to give scope to information from both axes in different resolutions. With the MR-Haar block, the HaarMoDic network can make predictions referring to a broader range of information. Experimental results demonstrate that HaarMoDic surpasses state-of-the-art methods in every testing interval on the Human3.6M dataset in the Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) metric.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12631v1
Learning Cross-Spectral Point Features with Task-Oriented Training,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enable operations in remote and hazardous environments, yet the visible-spectrum, camera-based navigation systems often relied upon by UAVs struggle in low-visibility conditions. Thermal cameras, which capture long-wave infrared radiation, are able to function effectively in darkness and smoke, where visible-light cameras fail. This work explores learned cross-spectral (thermal-visible) point features as a means to integrate thermal imagery into established camera-based navigation systems. Existing methods typically train a feature network's detection and description outputs directly, which often focuses training on image regions where thermal and visible-spectrum images exhibit similar appearance. Aiming to more fully utilize the available data, we propose a method to train the feature network on the tasks of matching and registration. We run our feature network on thermal-visible image pairs, then feed the network response into a differentiable registration pipeline. Losses are applied to the matching and registration estimates of this pipeline. Our selected model, trained on the task of matching, achieves a registration error (corner error) below 10 pixels for more than 75% of estimates on the MultiPoint dataset. We further demonstrate that our model can also be used with a classical pipeline for matching and registration.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12593v1
Diffusion-NPO: Negative Preference Optimization for Better Preference   Aligned Generation of Diffusion Models,"Diffusion models have made substantial advances in image generation, yet models trained on large, unfiltered datasets often yield outputs misaligned with human preferences. Numerous methods have been proposed to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models, achieving notable improvements in aligning generated outputs with human preferences. However, we argue that existing preference alignment methods neglect the critical role of handling unconditional/negative-conditional outputs, leading to a diminished capacity to avoid generating undesirable outcomes. This oversight limits the efficacy of classifier-free guidance~(CFG), which relies on the contrast between conditional generation and unconditional/negative-conditional generation to optimize output quality. In response, we propose a straightforward but versatile effective approach that involves training a model specifically attuned to negative preferences. This method does not require new training strategies or datasets but rather involves minor modifications to existing techniques. Our approach integrates seamlessly with models such as SD1.5, SDXL, video diffusion models and models that have undergone preference optimization, consistently enhancing their alignment with human preferences.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11245v1
Urban Representation Learning for Fine-grained Economic Mapping: A   Semi-supervised Graph-based Approach,"Fine-grained economic mapping through urban representation learning has emerged as a crucial tool for evidence-based economic decisions. While existing methods primarily rely on supervised or unsupervised approaches, they often overlook semi-supervised learning in data-scarce scenarios and lack unified multi-task frameworks for comprehensive sectoral economic analysis. To address these gaps, we propose SemiGTX, an explainable semi-supervised graph learning framework for sectoral economic mapping. The framework is designed with dedicated fusion encoding modules for various geospatial data modalities, seamlessly integrating them into a cohesive graph structure. It introduces a semi-information loss function that combines spatial self-supervision with locally masked supervised regression, enabling more informative and effective region representations. Through multi-task learning, SemiGTX concurrently maps GDP across primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors within a unified model. Extensive experiments conducted in the Pearl River Delta region of China demonstrate the model's superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving R2 scores of 0.93, 0.96, and 0.94 for the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors, respectively. Cross-regional experiments in Beijing and Chengdu further illustrate its generality. Systematic analysis reveals how different data modalities influence model predictions, enhancing explainability while providing valuable insights for regional development planning. This representation learning framework advances regional economic monitoring through diverse urban data integration, providing a robust foundation for precise economic forecasting.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11645v1
SRMamba: Mamba for Super-Resolution of LiDAR Point Clouds,"In recent years, range-view-based LiDAR point cloud super-resolution techniques attract significant attention as a low-cost method for generating higher-resolution point cloud data. However, due to the sparsity and irregular structure of LiDAR point clouds, the point cloud super-resolution problem remains a challenging topic, especially for point cloud upsampling under novel views. In this paper, we propose SRMamba, a novel method for super-resolution of LiDAR point clouds in sparse scenes, addressing the key challenge of recovering the 3D spatial structure of point clouds from novel views. Specifically, we implement projection technique based on Hough Voting and Hole Compensation strategy to eliminate horizontally linear holes in range image. To improve the establishment of long-distance dependencies and to focus on potential geometric features in vertical 3D space, we employ Visual State Space model and Multi-Directional Scanning mechanism to mitigate the loss of 3D spatial structural information due to the range image. Additionally, an asymmetric U-Net network adapts to the input characteristics of LiDARs with different beam counts, enabling super-resolution reconstruction for multi-beam point clouds. We conduct a series of experiments on multiple challenging public LiDAR datasets (SemanticKITTI and nuScenes), and SRMamba demonstrates significant superiority over other algorithms in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10601v1
LLaVA-4D: Embedding SpatioTemporal Prompt into LMMs for 4D Scene   Understanding,"Despite achieving significant progress in 2D image understanding, large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle in the physical world due to the lack of spatial representation. Typically, existing 3D LMMs mainly embed 3D positions as fixed spatial prompts within visual features to represent the scene. However, these methods are limited to understanding the static background and fail to capture temporally varying dynamic objects. In this paper, we propose LLaVA-4D, a general LMM framework with a novel spatiotemporal prompt for visual representation in 4D scene understanding. The spatiotemporal prompt is generated by encoding 3D position and 1D time into a dynamic-aware 4D coordinate embedding. Moreover, we demonstrate that spatial and temporal components disentangled from visual features are more effective in distinguishing the background from objects. This motivates embedding the 4D spatiotemporal prompt into these features to enhance the dynamic scene representation. By aligning visual spatiotemporal embeddings with language embeddings, LMMs gain the ability to understand both spatial and temporal characteristics of static background and dynamic objects in the physical world. Additionally, we construct a 4D vision-language dataset with spatiotemporal coordinate annotations for instruction fine-tuning LMMs. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across different tasks in 4D scene understanding.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12253v1
Attend to Not Attended: Structure-then-Detail Token Merging for   Post-training DiT Acceleration,"Diffusion transformers have shown exceptional performance in visual generation but incur high computational costs. Token reduction techniques that compress models by sharing the denoising process among similar tokens have been introduced. However, existing approaches neglect the denoising priors of the diffusion models, leading to suboptimal acceleration and diminished image quality. This study proposes a novel concept: attend to prune feature redundancies in areas not attended by the diffusion process. We analyze the location and degree of feature redundancies based on the structure-then-detail denoising priors. Subsequently, we introduce SDTM, a structure-then-detail token merging approach that dynamically compresses feature redundancies. Specifically, we design dynamic visual token merging, compression ratio adjusting, and prompt reweighting for different stages. Served in a post-training way, the proposed method can be integrated seamlessly into any DiT architecture. Extensive experiments across various backbones, schedulers, and datasets showcase the superiority of our method, for example, it achieves 1.55 times acceleration with negligible impact on image quality.

SynRailObs: A Synthetic Dataset for Obstacle Detection in Railway   Scenarios,"Detecting potential obstacles in railway environments is critical for preventing serious accidents. Identifying a broad range of obstacle categories under complex conditions requires large-scale datasets with precisely annotated, high-quality images. However, existing publicly available datasets fail to meet these requirements, thereby hindering progress in railway safety research. To address this gap, we introduce SynRailObs, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset designed to represent a diverse range of weather conditions and geographical features. Furthermore, diffusion models are employed to generate rare and difficult-to-capture obstacles that are typically challenging to obtain in real-world scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of SynRailObs, we perform experiments in real-world railway environments, testing on both ballasted and ballastless tracks across various weather conditions. The results demonstrate that SynRailObs holds substantial potential for advancing obstacle detection in railway safety applications. Models trained on this dataset show consistent performance across different distances and environmental conditions. Moreover, the model trained on SynRailObs exhibits zero-shot capabilities, which are essential for applications in security-sensitive domains. The data is available in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/qiushi910/synrailobs.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10784v1
NVSPolicy: Adaptive Novel-View Synthesis for Generalizable   Language-Conditioned Policy Learning,"Recent advances in deep generative models demonstrate unprecedented zero-shot generalization capabilities, offering great potential for robot manipulation in unstructured environments. Given a partial observation of a scene, deep generative models could generate the unseen regions and therefore provide more context, which enhances the capability of robots to generalize across unseen environments. However, due to the visual artifacts in generated images and inefficient integration of multi-modal features in policy learning, this direction remains an open challenge. We introduce NVSPolicy, a generalizable language-conditioned policy learning method that couples an adaptive novel-view synthesis module with a hierarchical policy network. Given an input image, NVSPolicy dynamically selects an informative viewpoint and synthesizes an adaptive novel-view image to enrich the visual context. To mitigate the impact of the imperfect synthesized images, we adopt a cycle-consistent VAE mechanism that disentangles the visual features into the semantic feature and the remaining feature. The two features are then fed into the hierarchical policy network respectively: the semantic feature informs the high-level meta-skill selection, and the remaining feature guides low-level action estimation. Moreover, we propose several practical mechanisms to make the proposed method efficient. Extensive experiments on CALVIN demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method. Specifically, it achieves an average success rate of 90.4\% across all tasks, greatly outperforming the recent methods. Ablation studies confirm the significance of our adaptive novel-view synthesis paradigm. In addition, we evaluate NVSPolicy on a real-world robotic platform to demonstrate its practical applicability.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10359v1
From Fibers to Cells: Fourier-Based Registration Enables Virtual Cresyl   Violet Staining From 3D Polarized Light Imaging,"Comprehensive assessment of the various aspects of the brain's microstructure requires the use of complementary imaging techniques. This includes measuring the spatial distribution of cell bodies (cytoarchitecture) and nerve fibers (myeloarchitecture). The gold standard for cytoarchitectonic analysis is light microscopic imaging of cell-body stained tissue sections. To reveal the 3D orientations of nerve fibers, 3D Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) has been introduced as a reliable technique providing a resolution in the micrometer range while allowing processing of series of complete brain sections. 3D-PLI acquisition is label-free and allows subsequent staining of sections after measurement. By post-staining for cell bodies, a direct link between fiber- and cytoarchitecture can potentially be established within the same section. However, inevitable distortions introduced during the staining process make a nonlinear and cross-modal registration necessary in order to study the detailed relationships between cells and fibers in the images. In addition, the complexity of processing histological sections for post-staining only allows for a limited number of samples. In this work, we take advantage of deep learning methods for image-to-image translation to generate a virtual staining of 3D-PLI that is spatially aligned at the cellular level. In a supervised setting, we build on a unique dataset of brain sections, to which Cresyl violet staining has been applied after 3D-PLI measurement. To ensure high correspondence between both modalities, we address the misalignment of training data using Fourier-based registration methods. In this way, registration can be efficiently calculated during training for local image patches of target and predicted staining. We demonstrate that the proposed method enables prediction of a Cresyl violet staining from 3D-PLI, matching individual cell instances.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11394v1
SpikeVideoFormer: An Efficient Spike-Driven Video Transformer with   Hamming Attention and $\mathcal{O}(T)$ Complexity,"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown competitive performance to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in various vision tasks, while offering superior energy efficiency. However, existing SNN-based Transformers primarily focus on single-image tasks, emphasizing spatial features while not effectively leveraging SNNs' efficiency in video-based vision tasks. In this paper, we introduce SpikeVideoFormer, an efficient spike-driven video Transformer, featuring linear temporal complexity $\mathcal{O}(T)$. Specifically, we design a spike-driven Hamming attention (SDHA) which provides a theoretically guided adaptation from traditional real-valued attention to spike-driven attention. Building on SDHA, we further analyze various spike-driven space-time attention designs and identify an optimal scheme that delivers appealing performance for video tasks, while maintaining only linear temporal complexity. The generalization ability and efficiency of our model are demonstrated across diverse downstream video tasks, including classification, human pose tracking, and semantic segmentation. Empirical results show our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing SNN approaches, with over 15\% improvement on the latter two tasks. Additionally, it matches the performance of recent ANN-based methods while offering significant efficiency gains, achieving $\times 16$, $\times 10$ and $\times 5$ improvements on the three tasks. https://github.com/JimmyZou/SpikeVideoFormer",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10352v1
Depth Anything with Any Prior,"This work presents Prior Depth Anything, a framework that combines incomplete but precise metric information in depth measurement with relative but complete geometric structures in depth prediction, generating accurate, dense, and detailed metric depth maps for any scene. To this end, we design a coarse-to-fine pipeline to progressively integrate the two complementary depth sources. First, we introduce pixel-level metric alignment and distance-aware weighting to pre-fill diverse metric priors by explicitly using depth prediction. It effectively narrows the domain gap between prior patterns, enhancing generalization across varying scenarios. Second, we develop a conditioned monocular depth estimation (MDE) model to refine the inherent noise of depth priors. By conditioning on the normalized pre-filled prior and prediction, the model further implicitly merges the two complementary depth sources. Our model showcases impressive zero-shot generalization across depth completion, super-resolution, and inpainting over 7 real-world datasets, matching or even surpassing previous task-specific methods. More importantly, it performs well on challenging, unseen mixed priors and enables test-time improvements by switching prediction models, providing a flexible accuracy-efficiency trade-off while evolving with advancements in MDE models.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10565v1
LOVE: Benchmarking and Evaluating Text-to-Video Generation and   Video-to-Text Interpretation,"Recent advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs) have driven substantial progress in both text-to-video (T2V) generation and video-to-text (V2T) interpretation tasks. However, current AI-generated videos (AIGVs) still exhibit limitations in terms of perceptual quality and text-video alignment. Therefore, a reliable and scalable automatic model for AIGV evaluation is desirable, which heavily relies on the scale and quality of human annotations. To this end, we present AIGVE-60K, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for AI-Generated Video Evaluation, which features (i) comprehensive tasks, encompassing 3,050 extensive prompts across 20 fine-grained task dimensions, (ii) the largest human annotations, including 120K mean-opinion scores (MOSs) and 60K question-answering (QA) pairs annotated on 58,500 videos generated from 30 T2V models, and (iii) bidirectional benchmarking and evaluating for both T2V generation and V2T interpretation capabilities. Based on AIGVE-60K, we propose LOVE, a LMM-based metric for AIGV Evaluation from multiple dimensions including perceptual preference, text-video correspondence, and task-specific accuracy in terms of both instance level and model level. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LOVE not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AIGVE-60K dataset, but also generalizes effectively to a wide range of other AIGV evaluation benchmarks. These findings highlight the significance of the AIGVE-60K dataset. Database and codes are anonymously available at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/LOVE.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12098v1
DC-Seg: Disentangled Contrastive Learning for Brain Tumor Segmentation   with Missing Modalities,"Accurate segmentation of brain images typically requires the integration of complementary information from multiple image modalities. However, clinical data for all modalities may not be available for every patient, creating a significant challenge. To address this, previous studies encode multiple modalities into a shared latent space. While somewhat effective, it remains suboptimal, as each modality contains distinct and valuable information. In this study, we propose DC-Seg (Disentangled Contrastive Learning for Segmentation), a new method that explicitly disentangles images into modality-invariant anatomical representation and modality-specific representation, by using anatomical contrastive learning and modality contrastive learning respectively. This solution improves the separation of anatomical and modality-specific features by considering the modality gaps, leading to more robust representations. Furthermore, we introduce a segmentation-based regularizer that enhances the model's robustness to missing modalities. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2020 and a private white matter hyperintensity(WMH) segmentation dataset demonstrate that DC-Seg outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling incomplete multimodal brain tumor segmentation tasks with varying missing modalities, while also demonstrate strong generalizability in WMH segmentation.

Deepfake Forensic Analysis: Source Dataset Attribution and Legal   Implications of Synthetic Media Manipulation,"Synthetic media generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) pose significant challenges in verifying authenticity and tracing dataset origins, raising critical concerns in copyright enforcement, privacy protection, and legal compliance. This paper introduces a novel forensic framework for identifying the training dataset (e.g., CelebA or FFHQ) of GAN-generated images through interpretable feature analysis. By integrating spectral transforms (Fourier/DCT), color distribution metrics, and local feature descriptors (SIFT), our pipeline extracts discriminative statistical signatures embedded in synthetic outputs. Supervised classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) achieve 98-99% accuracy in binary classification (real vs. synthetic) and multi-class dataset attribution across diverse GAN architectures (StyleGAN, AttGAN, GDWCT, StarGAN, and StyleGAN2). Experimental results highlight the dominance of frequency-domain features (DCT/FFT) in capturing dataset-specific artifacts, such as upsampling patterns and spectral irregularities, while color histograms reveal implicit regularization strategies in GAN training. We further examine legal and ethical implications, showing how dataset attribution can address copyright infringement, unauthorized use of personal data, and regulatory compliance under frameworks like GDPR and California's AB 602. Our framework advances accountability and governance in generative modeling, with applications in digital forensics, content moderation, and intellectual property litigation.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11110v1
LogicOCR: Do Your Large Multimodal Models Excel at Logical Reasoning on   Text-Rich Images?,"Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have significantly improved their reasoning and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities. However, their performance on complex logical reasoning tasks involving text-rich images remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce LogicOCR, a benchmark comprising 1,100 multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate LMMs' logical reasoning abilities on text-rich images, while minimizing reliance on domain-specific knowledge (e.g., mathematics). We construct LogicOCR by curating a text corpus from the Chinese National Civil Servant Examination and develop a scalable, automated pipeline to convert it into multimodal samples. First, we design prompt templates to steer GPT-Image-1 to generate images with diverse backgrounds, interleaved text-illustration layouts, and varied fonts, ensuring contextual relevance and visual realism. Then, the generated images are manually verified, with low-quality examples discarded. We evaluate a range of representative open-source and proprietary LMMs under both Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and direct-answer settings. Our multi-dimensional analysis reveals key insights, such as the impact of test-time scaling, input modality differences, and sensitivity to visual-text orientation. Notably, LMMs still lag in multimodal reasoning compared to text-only inputs, indicating that they have not fully bridged visual reading with reasoning. We hope LogicOCR will serve as a valuable resource for advancing multimodal reasoning research. The dataset is available at https://github.com/MiliLab/LogicOCR.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12307v1
eStonefish-scenes: A synthetically generated dataset for underwater   event-based optical flow prediction tasks,"The combined use of event-based vision and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) is expected to significantly impact robotics, particularly in tasks like visual odometry and obstacle avoidance. While existing real-world event-based datasets for optical flow prediction, typically captured with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), offer valuable insights, they are limited in diversity, scalability, and are challenging to collect. Moreover, there is a notable lack of labelled datasets for underwater applications, which hinders the integration of event-based vision with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). To address this, synthetic datasets could provide a scalable solution while bridging the gap between simulation and reality. In this work, we introduce eStonefish-scenes, a synthetic event-based optical flow dataset based on the Stonefish simulator. Along with the dataset, we present a data generation pipeline that enables the creation of customizable underwater environments. This pipeline allows for simulating dynamic scenarios, such as biologically inspired schools of fish exhibiting realistic motion patterns, including obstacle avoidance and reactive navigation around corals. Additionally, we introduce a scene generator that can build realistic reef seabeds by randomly distributing coral across the terrain. To streamline data accessibility, we present eWiz, a comprehensive library designed for processing event-based data, offering tools for data loading, augmentation, visualization, encoding, and training data generation, along with loss functions and performance metrics.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13309v1
Rethinking the Mean Teacher Strategy from the Perspective of Self-paced   Learning,"Semi-supervised medical image segmentation has attracted significant attention due to its potential to reduce manual annotation costs. The mean teacher (MT) strategy, commonly understood as introducing smoothed, temporally lagged consistency regularization, has demonstrated strong performance across various tasks in this field. In this work, we reinterpret the MT strategy on supervised data as a form of self-paced learning, regulated by the output agreement between the temporally lagged teacher model and the ground truth labels. This idea is further extended to incorporate agreement between a temporally lagged model and a cross-architectural model, which offers greater flexibility in regulating the learning pace and enables application to unlabeled data. Specifically, we propose dual teacher-student learning (DTSL), a framework that introduces two groups of teacher-student models with different architectures. The output agreement between the cross-group teacher and student models is used as pseudo-labels, generated via a Jensen-Shannon divergence-based consensus label generator (CLG). Extensive experiments on popular datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11018v1
From Embeddings to Accuracy: Comparing Foundation Models for   Radiographic Classification,"Foundation models, pretrained on extensive datasets, have significantly advanced machine learning by providing robust and transferable embeddings applicable to various domains, including medical imaging diagnostics. This study evaluates the utility of embeddings derived from both general-purpose and medical domain-specific foundation models for training lightweight adapter models in multi-class radiography classification, focusing specifically on tube placement assessment. A dataset comprising 8842 radiographs classified into seven distinct categories was employed to extract embeddings using six foundation models: DenseNet121, BiomedCLIP, Med-Flamingo, MedImageInsight, Rad-DINO, and CXR-Foundation. Adapter models were subsequently trained using classical machine learning algorithms. Among these combinations, MedImageInsight embeddings paired with an support vector machine adapter yielded the highest mean area under the curve (mAUC) at 93.8%, followed closely by Rad-DINO (91.1%) and CXR-Foundation (89.0%). In comparison, BiomedCLIP and DenseNet121 exhibited moderate performance with mAUC scores of 83.0% and 81.8%, respectively, whereas Med-Flamingo delivered the lowest performance at 75.1%. Notably, most adapter models demonstrated computational efficiency, achieving training within one minute and inference within seconds on CPU, underscoring their practicality for clinical applications. Furthermore, fairness analyses on adapters trained on MedImageInsight-derived embeddings indicated minimal disparities, with gender differences in performance within 2% and standard deviations across age groups not exceeding 3%. These findings confirm that foundation model embeddings-especially those from MedImageInsight-facilitate accurate, computationally efficient, and equitable diagnostic classification using lightweight adapters for radiographic image analysis.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10823v1
MSCI: Addressing CLIP's Inherent Limitations for Compositional Zero-Shot   Learning,"Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object combinations by leveraging known combinations. Existing studies basically rely on the cross-modal alignment capabilities of CLIP but tend to overlook its limitations in capturing fine-grained local features, which arise from its architectural and training paradigm. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-Stage Cross-modal Interaction (MSCI) model that effectively explores and utilizes intermediate-layer information from CLIP's visual encoder. Specifically, we design two self-adaptive aggregators to extract local information from low-level visual features and integrate global information from high-level visual features, respectively. These key information are progressively incorporated into textual representations through a stage-by-stage interaction mechanism, significantly enhancing the model's perception capability for fine-grained local visual information. Additionally, MSCI dynamically adjusts the attention weights between global and local visual information based on different combinations, as well as different elements within the same combination, allowing it to flexibly adapt to diverse scenarios. Experiments on three widely used datasets fully validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model.

CompBench: Benchmarking Complex Instruction-guided Image Editing,"While real-world applications increasingly demand intricate scene manipulation, existing instruction-guided image editing benchmarks often oversimplify task complexity and lack comprehensive, fine-grained instructions. To bridge this gap, we introduce, a large-scale benchmark specifically designed for complex instruction-guided image editing. CompBench features challenging editing scenarios that incorporate fine-grained instruction following, spatial and contextual reasoning, thereby enabling comprehensive evaluation of image editing models' precise manipulation capabilities. To construct CompBench, We propose an MLLM-human collaborative framework with tailored task pipelines. Furthermore, we propose an instruction decoupling strategy that disentangles editing intents into four key dimensions: location, appearance, dynamics, and objects, ensuring closer alignment between instructions and complex editing requirements. Extensive evaluations reveal that CompBench exposes fundamental limitations of current image editing models and provides critical insights for the development of next-generation instruction-guided image editing systems.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12200v1
Dynam3D: Dynamic Layered 3D Tokens Empower VLM for Vision-and-Language   Navigation,"Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core task where embodied agents leverage their spatial mobility to navigate in 3D environments toward designated destinations based on natural language instructions. Recently, video-language large models (Video-VLMs) with strong generalization capabilities and rich commonsense knowledge have shown remarkable performance when applied to VLN tasks. However, these models still encounter the following challenges when applied to real-world 3D navigation: 1) Insufficient understanding of 3D geometry and spatial semantics; 2) Limited capacity for large-scale exploration and long-term environmental memory; 3) Poor adaptability to dynamic and changing environments.To address these limitations, we propose Dynam3D, a dynamic layered 3D representation model that leverages language-aligned, generalizable, and hierarchical 3D representations as visual input to train 3D-VLM in navigation action prediction. Given posed RGB-D images, our Dynam3D projects 2D CLIP features into 3D space and constructs multi-level 3D patch-instance-zone representations for 3D geometric and semantic understanding with a dynamic and layer-wise update strategy. Our Dynam3D is capable of online encoding and localization of 3D instances, and dynamically updates them in changing environments to provide large-scale exploration and long-term memory capabilities for navigation. By leveraging large-scale 3D-language pretraining and task-specific adaptation, our Dynam3D sets new state-of-the-art performance on VLN benchmarks including R2R-CE, REVERIE-CE and NavRAG-CE under monocular settings. Furthermore, experiments for pre-exploration, lifelong memory, and real-world robot validate the effectiveness of practical deployment.",CV,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11383v1
Rollbaccine : Herd Immunity against Storage Rollback Attacks in TEEs   [Technical Report],"Today, users can ""lift-and-shift"" unmodified applications into modern, VM-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) in order to gain hardware-based security guarantees. However, TEEs do not protect applications against disk rollback attacks, where persistent storage can be reverted to an earlier state after a crash; existing rollback resistance solutions either only support a subset of applications or require code modification. Our key insight is that restoring disk consistency after a rollback attack guarantees rollback resistance for any application. We present Rollbaccine, a device mapper that provides automatic rollback resistance for all applications by provably preserving disk consistency. Rollbaccine intercepts and replicates writes to disk, restores lost state from backups during recovery, and minimizes overheads by taking advantage of the weak, multi-threaded semantics of disk operations. Across benchmarks over two real applications (PostgreSQL and HDFS) and two file systems (ext4 and xfs), Rollbaccine adds only 19% overhead, except for the fsync-heavy Filebench Varmail. In addition, Rollbaccine outperforms the state-of-the-art, non-automatic rollback resistant solution by $208\times$.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04014v1

In order to facilitate the wide-spread deployment of FPGA-SoC TEE, this paper proposes an approach for constructing a TPM 2.0-compatible runtime customizable TEE on FPGA-SoC. This approach leverages a user-controllable virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) that integrates sensitive operations specific to FPGA-SoC TEE. It provides TPM 2.0 support for a customizable FPGA-SoC TEE to dynamically measure, deploy, and invoke IP during runtime. Our main contributions include: (i) Propose an FPGA-vTPM architecture that enables the TPM 2.0 specification support for FPGA-SoC TEE; (ii) Explore the utilization of FPGA-vTPM to dynamically measure, deploy, and invoke users' IPs on FPGA-SoC TEE; (iii) Extend the TPM command set to accommodate the sensitive operations of FPGA-SoC TEE, enabling users to perform sensitive tasks in a secure and verifiable manner according to the TPM 2.0 specification. We implement a prototype of TRCTEE on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC platform and conducted security analysis and performance evaluations to prove the practicality and enhanced security features of this approach.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12256v1
Data-Driven Falsification of Cyber-Physical Systems,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are abundant in safety-critical domains such as healthcare, avionics, and autonomous vehicles. Formal verification of their operational safety is, therefore, of utmost importance. In this paper, we address the falsification problem, where the focus is on searching for an unsafe execution in the system instead of proving their absence. The contribution of this paper is a framework that (a) connects the falsification of CPS with the falsification of deep neural networks (DNNs) and (b) leverages the inherent interpretability of Decision Trees for faster falsification of CPS. This is achieved by: (1) building a surrogate model of the CPS under test, either as a DNN model or a Decision Tree, (2) application of various DNN falsification tools to falsify CPS, and (3) a novel falsification algorithm guided by the explanations of safety violations of the CPS model extracted from its Decision Tree surrogate. The proposed framework has the potential to exploit a repertoire of \emph{adversarial attack} algorithms designed to falsify robustness properties of DNNs, as well as state-of-the-art falsification algorithms for DNNs. Although the presented methodology is applicable to systems that can be executed/simulated in general, we demonstrate its effectiveness, particularly in CPS. We show that our framework, implemented as a tool \textsc{FlexiFal}, can detect hard-to-find counterexamples in CPS that have linear and non-linear dynamics. Decision tree-guided falsification shows promising results in efficiently finding multiple counterexamples in the ARCH-COMP 2024 falsification benchmarks~\cite{khandait2024arch}.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03863v1
CANTXSec: A Deterministic Intrusion Detection and Prevention System for   CAN Bus Monitoring ECU Activations,"Despite being a legacy protocol with various known security issues, Controller Area Network (CAN) still represents the de-facto standard for communications within vehicles, ships, and industrial control systems. Many research works have designed Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to identify attacks by training machine learning classifiers on bus traffic or its properties. Actions to take after detection are, on the other hand, less investigated, and prevention mechanisms usually include protocol modification (e.g., adding authentication). An effective solution has yet to be implemented on a large scale in the wild. The reasons are related to the effort to handle sporadic false positives, the inevitable delay introduced by authentication, and the closed-source automobile environment that does not easily permit modifying Electronic Control Units (ECUs) software.   In this paper, we propose CANTXSec, the first deterministic Intrusion Detection and Prevention system based on physical ECU activations. It employs a new classification of attacks based on the attacker's need in terms of access level to the bus, distinguishing between Frame Injection Attacks (FIAs) (i.e., using frame-level access) and Single-Bit Attacks (SBAs) (i.e., employing bit-level access). CANTXSec detects and prevents classical attacks in the CAN bus, while detecting advanced attacks that have been less investigated in the literature. We prove the effectiveness of our solution on a physical testbed, where we achieve 100% detection accuracy in both classes of attacks while preventing 100% of FIAs. Moreover, to encourage developers to employ CANTXSec, we discuss implementation details, providing an analysis based on each user's risk assessment.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09384v1
Phare: A Safety Probe for Large Language Models,"Ensuring the safety of large language models (LLMs) is critical for responsible deployment, yet existing evaluations often prioritize performance over identifying failure modes. We introduce Phare, a multilingual diagnostic framework to probe and evaluate LLM behavior across three critical dimensions: hallucination and reliability, social biases, and harmful content generation. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals patterns of systematic vulnerabilities across all safety dimensions, including sycophancy, prompt sensitivity, and stereotype reproduction. By highlighting these specific failure modes rather than simply ranking models, Phare provides researchers and practitioners with actionable insights to build more robust, aligned, and trustworthy language systems.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11365v2
Network-wide Quantum Key Distribution with Onion Routing Relay,"The advancement of quantum computing threatens classical cryptographic methods, necessitating the development of secure quantum key distribution (QKD) solutions for QKD Networks (QKDN). In this paper, a novel key distribution protocol, Onion Routing Relay (ORR), that integrates onion routing (OR) with post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in a key-relay (KR) model is evaluated for QKDNs. This approach increases the security by enhancing confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and anonymity in quantum-secure communications. By employing PQC-based encapsulation, ORR pretends to avoid the security risks posed by intermediate malicious nodes and ensures end-to-end security. Results show that the performance of the ORR model, against current key-relay (KR) and trusted-node (TN) approaches, demonstrating its feasibility and applicability in high-security environments maintaining a consistent Quality of Service (QoS). The results show that while ORR incurs higher encryption overhead, it provides substantial security improvements without significantly impacting the overall key distribution time.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13239v1
LATENT: LLM-Augmented Trojan Insertion and Evaluation Framework for   Analog Netlist Topologies,"Analog and mixed-signal (A/MS) integrated circuits (ICs) are integral to safety-critical applications. However, the globalization and outsourcing of A/MS ICs to untrusted third-party foundries expose them to security threats, particularly analog Trojans. Unlike digital Trojans which have been extensively studied, analog Trojans remain largely unexplored. There has been only limited research on their diversity and stealth in analog designs, where a Trojan is activated only during a narrow input voltage range. Effective defense techniques require a clear understanding of the attack vectors; however, the lack of diverse analog Trojan instances limits robust advances in detection strategies. To address this gap, we present LATENT, the first large language model (LLM)-driven framework for crafting stealthy, circuit-specific analog Trojans. LATENT incorporates LLM as an autonomous agent to intelligently insert and refine Trojan components within analog designs based on iterative feedback from a detection model. This feedback loop ensures that the inserted Trojans remain stealthy while successfully evading detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our generated Trojan designs exhibit an average Trojan-activation range of 15.74%, ensuring they remain inactive under most operating voltages, while causing a significant performance degradation of 11.3% upon activation.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06364v1
Compile-Time Fully Homomorphic Encryption: Eliminating Online Encryption   via Algebraic Basis Synthesis,"We propose a new framework for compile-time ciphertext synthesis in fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) systems. Instead of invoking encryption algorithms at runtime, our method synthesizes ciphertexts from precomputed encrypted basis vectors using only homomorphic additions, scalar multiplications, and randomized encryptions of zero. This decouples ciphertext generation from encryption, and enables efficient batch encoding through algebraic reuse. We formalize this technique as a randomized module morphism and prove that it satisfies IND-CPA security. Our proof uses a hybrid game framework that interpolates between encrypted vector instances and reduces adversarial advantage to the indistinguishability of the underlying FHE scheme. This reduction structure captures the security implications of ciphertext basis reuse and structured noise injection. The proposed synthesis primitive supports fast, encryption-free ingestion in outsourced database systems and other high-throughput FHE pipelines. It is compatible with standard FHE APIs and preserves layout semantics for downstream homomorphic operations.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12582v1
SecReEvalBench: A Multi-turned Security Resilience Evaluation Benchmark   for Large Language Models,"The increasing deployment of large language models in security-sensitive domains necessitates rigorous evaluation of their resilience against adversarial prompt-based attacks. While previous benchmarks have focused on security evaluations with limited and predefined attack domains, such as cybersecurity attacks, they often lack a comprehensive assessment of intent-driven adversarial prompts and the consideration of real-life scenario-based multi-turn attacks. To address this gap, we present SecReEvalBench, the Security Resilience Evaluation Benchmark, which defines four novel metrics: Prompt Attack Resilience Score, Prompt Attack Refusal Logic Score, Chain-Based Attack Resilience Score and Chain-Based Attack Rejection Time Score. Moreover, SecReEvalBench employs six questioning sequences for model assessment: one-off attack, successive attack, successive reverse attack, alternative attack, sequential ascending attack with escalating threat levels and sequential descending attack with diminishing threat levels. In addition, we introduce a dataset customized for the benchmark, which incorporates both neutral and malicious prompts, categorised across seven security domains and sixteen attack techniques. In applying this benchmark, we systematically evaluate five state-of-the-art open-weighted large language models, Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, Mistral v0.3, DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen 3. Our findings offer critical insights into the strengths and weaknesses of modern large language models in defending against evolving adversarial threats. The SecReEvalBench dataset is publicly available at https://kaggle.com/datasets/5a7ee22cf9dab6c93b55a73f630f6c9b42e936351b0ae98fbae6ddaca7fe248d, which provides a groundwork for advancing research in large language model security.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07584v2
Red Teaming the Mind of the Machine: A Systematic Evaluation of Prompt   Injection and Jailbreak Vulnerabilities in LLMs,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into consumer and enterprise applications. Despite their capabilities, they remain susceptible to adversarial attacks such as prompt injection and jailbreaks that override alignment safeguards. This paper provides a systematic investigation of jailbreak strategies against various state-of-the-art LLMs. We categorize over 1,400 adversarial prompts, analyze their success against GPT-4, Claude 2, Mistral 7B, and Vicuna, and examine their generalizability and construction logic. We further propose layered mitigation strategies and recommend a hybrid red-teaming and sandboxing approach for robust LLM security.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04806v2
Testing Access-Control Configuration Changes for Web Applications,"Access-control misconfigurations are among the main causes of today's data breaches in web applications. However, few techniques are available to support automatic and systematic testing for access-control changes and detecting risky changes to prevent severe consequences. As a result, those critical security configurations often lack testing, or are tested manually in an ad hoc way.   This paper advocates that tests should be made available for users to test access-control configuration changes. The key challenges are such tests need to be run with production environments (to reason end-to-end behavior) and need to be performance-efficient. We present a new approach to create such tests, as a mini test environment incorporating production program and data, called ACtests. ACtests report the impacts of access-control changes, namely the requests that were denied but would be allowed after a change, and vice versa. Users can validate if the changed requests are intended or not and identify potential security vulnerabilities.   We evaluate ACtests with 193 public configurations of widely-used web applications on Dockerhub. ACtests detect 168 new vulnerabilities from 72 configuration images. We report them to the image maintainers: 54 of them have been confirmed and 44 have been fixed. We also conduct in-depth experiments with five real-world deployed systems, including Wikipedia and a commercial company's web proxy. Our results show that ACtests effectively and efficiently detect all the change impacts.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12770v1
Cryptanalysis of a Lattice-Based PIR Scheme for Arbitrary Database Sizes,"Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes enable users to securely retrieve files from a server without disclosing the content of their queries, thereby preserving their privacy. In 2008, Melchor and Gaborit proposed a PIR scheme that achieves a balance between communication overhead and server-side computational cost. However, for particularly small databases, Liu and Bi identified a vulnerability in the scheme using lattice-based methods. Nevertheless, the rapid increase in computational cost associated with the attack limited its practical applicability, leaving the scheme's overall security largely intact. In this paper, we present a novel two-stage attack that extends the work of Liu and Bi to databases of arbitrary sizes. To this end, we employ a binary-search-like preprocessing technique, which enables a significant reduction in the number of lattice problems that need to be considered. Specifically, we demonstrate how to compromise the scheme in a matter of minutes using an ordinary laptop. Our findings are substantiated through both rigorous analytical proofs and comprehensive numerical experiments.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05934v1
Prink: $k_s$-Anonymization for Streaming Data in Apache Flink,"In this paper, we present Prink, a novel and practically applicable concept and fully implemented prototype for ks-anonymizing data streams in real-world application architectures. Building upon the pre-existing, yet rudimentary CASTLE scheme, Prink for the first time introduces semantics-aware ks-anonymization of non-numerical (such as categorical or hierarchically generalizable) streaming data in a information loss-optimized manner. In addition, it provides native integration into Apache Flink, one of the prevailing frameworks for enterprise-grade stream data processing in numerous application domains.   Our contributions excel the previously established state of the art for the privacy guarantee-providing anonymization of streaming data in that they 1) allow to include non-numerical data in the anonymization process, 2) provide discrete datapoints instead of aggregates, thereby facilitating flexible data use, 3) are applicable in real-world system contexts with minimal integration efforts, and 4) are experimentally proven to raise acceptable performance overheads and information loss in realistic settings. With these characteristics, Prink provides an anonymization approach which is practically feasible for a broad variety of real-world, enterprise-grade stream processing applications and environments.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13153v1
PIG: Privacy Jailbreak Attack on LLMs via Gradient-based Iterative   In-Context Optimization,"Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various domains but pose inherent privacy risks. Existing methods to evaluate privacy leakage in LLMs often use memorized prefixes or simple instructions to extract data, both of which well-alignment models can easily block. Meanwhile, Jailbreak attacks bypass LLM safety mechanisms to generate harmful content, but their role in privacy scenarios remains underexplored. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks in extracting sensitive information, bridging privacy leakage and jailbreak attacks in LLMs. Moreover, we propose PIG, a novel framework targeting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and addressing the limitations of current jailbreak methods. Specifically, PIG identifies PII entities and their types in privacy queries, uses in-context learning to build a privacy context, and iteratively updates it with three gradient-based strategies to elicit target PII. We evaluate PIG and existing jailbreak methods using two privacy-related datasets. Experiments on four white-box and two black-box LLMs show that PIG outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results. The results underscore significant privacy risks in LLMs, emphasizing the need for stronger safeguards.

Active Sybil Attack and Efficient Defense Strategy in IPFS DHT,"The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) storage that relies on Kademlia, a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) structure commonly used in P2P systems for its proved scalability. However, DHTs are known to be vulnerable to Sybil attacks, in which a single entity controls multiple malicious nodes. Recent studies have shown that IPFS is affected by a passive content eclipse attack, leveraging Sybils, in which adversarial nodes hide received indexed information from other peers, making the content appear unavailable. Fortunately, the latest mitigation strategy coupling an attack detection based on statistical tests and a wider publication strategy upon detection was able to circumvent it.   In this work, we present a new active attack, with malicious nodes responding with semantically correct but intentionally false data, exploiting both an optimized placement of Sybils to stay below the detection threshold and an early trigger of the content discovery termination in Kubo, the main IPFS implementation. Our attack achieves to completely eclipse content on the latest Kubo release. When evaluated against the most recent known mitigation, it successfully denies access to the target content in approximately 80\% of lookup attempts.   To address this vulnerability, we propose a new mitigation called SR-DHT-Store, which enables efficient, Sybil-resistant content publication without relying on attack detection but instead on a systematic and precise use of region-based queries, defined by a dynamically computed XOR distance to the target ID. SR-DHT-Store can be combined with other defense mechanisms resulting in a defense strategy that completely mitigates both passive and active Sybil attacks at a lower overhead, while allowing an incremental deployment.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01139v1
RAP-SM: Robust Adversarial Prompt via Shadow Models for Copyright   Verification of Large Language Models,"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have underscored the importance of safeguarding intellectual property rights through robust fingerprinting techniques. Traditional fingerprint verification approaches typically focus on a single model, seeking to improve the robustness of its fingerprint.However, these single-model methods often struggle to capture intrinsic commonalities across multiple related models. In this paper, we propose RAP-SM (Robust Adversarial Prompt via Shadow Models), a novel framework that extracts a public fingerprint for an entire series of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that RAP-SM effectively captures the intrinsic commonalities among different models while exhibiting strong adversarial robustness. Our findings suggest that RAP-SM presents a valuable avenue for scalable fingerprint verification, offering enhanced protection against potential model breaches in the era of increasingly prevalent LLMs.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06304v1
Multiparty Selective Disclosure using Attribute-Based Encryption,"This study proposes a mechanism for encrypting SD-JWT (Selective Disclosure JSON Web Token) Disclosures using Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) to enable flexible access control on the basis of the Verifier's attributes. By integrating Ciphertext-Policy ABE (CP-ABE) into the existing SD-JWT framework, the Holder can assign decryption policies to Disclosures, ensuring information is selectively disclosed. The mechanism's feasibility was evaluated in a virtualized environment by measuring the processing times for SD-JWT generation, encryption, and decryption with varying Disclosure counts (5, 10, 20). Results showed that SD-JWT generation is lightweight, while encryption and decryption times increase linearly with the number of Disclosures. This approach is suitable for privacy-sensitive applications like healthcare, finance, and supply chain tracking but requires optimization for real-time use cases such as IoT. Future research should focus on improving ABE efficiency and addressing scalability challenges.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09034v1
SVAFD: A Secure and Verifiable Co-Aggregation Protocol for Federated   Distillation,"Secure Aggregation (SA) is an indispensable component of Federated Learning (FL) that concentrates on privacy preservation while allowing for robust aggregation. However, most SA designs rely heavily on the unrealistic assumption of homogeneous model architectures. Federated Distillation (FD), which aggregates locally computed logits instead of model parameters, introduces a promising alternative for cooperative training in heterogeneous model settings. Nevertheless, we recognize two major challenges in implementing SA for FD. (i) Prior SA designs encourage a dominant server, who is solely responsible for collecting, aggregating and distributing. Such central authority facilitates server to forge aggregation proofs or collude to bypass the claimed security guarantees; (ii) Existing SA, tailored for FL models, overlook the intrinsic properties of logits, making them unsuitable for FD.   To address these challenges, we propose SVAFD, the first SA protocol that is specifically designed for FD. At a high level, SVAFD incorporates two innovations: (i) a multilateral co-aggregation method tha redefines the responsibilities of clients and server. Clients autonomously evaluate and aggregate logits shares locally with a lightweight coding scheme, while the server handles ciphertext decoding and performs the task of generating verification proofs; (ii) a quality-aware knowledge filtration method that facilitates biased logits exclusion against poisoning attacks. Moreover, SVAFD is resilient to stragglers and colluding clients, making it well-suited for dynamic networks in real-world applications. We have implemented the SVAFD prototype over four emerging FD architectures and evaluated it against poisoning and inference attacks. Results demonstrate that SVAFD improves model accuracy, making it a significant step forward in secure and verifiable aggregation for heterogeneous FL systems.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13319v1
Cutting Through Privacy: A Hyperplane-Based Data Reconstruction Attack   in Federated Learning,"Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of machine learning models across distributed clients without sharing raw data, ostensibly preserving data privacy. Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed critical vulnerabilities in FL, showing that a malicious central server can manipulate model updates to reconstruct clients' private training data. Existing data reconstruction attacks have important limitations: they often rely on assumptions about the clients' data distribution or their efficiency significantly degrades when batch sizes exceed just a few tens of samples.   In this work, we introduce a novel data reconstruction attack that overcomes these limitations. Our method leverages a new geometric perspective on fully connected layers to craft malicious model parameters, enabling the perfect recovery of arbitrarily large data batches in classification tasks without any prior knowledge of clients' data. Through extensive experiments on both image and tabular datasets, we demonstrate that our attack outperforms existing methods and achieves perfect reconstruction of data batches two orders of magnitude larger than the state of the art.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10264v1
Improved Algorithms for Differentially Private Language Model Alignment,"Language model alignment is crucial for ensuring that large language models (LLMs) align with human preferences, yet it often involves sensitive user data, raising significant privacy concerns. While prior work has integrated differential privacy (DP) with alignment techniques, their performance remains limited. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for privacy-preserving alignment and rigorously analyze their effectiveness across varying privacy budgets and models. Our framework can be deployed on two celebrated alignment techniques, namely direct preference optimization (DPO) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Through systematic experiments on large-scale language models, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, one of our algorithms, DP-AdamW, combined with DPO, surpasses existing methods, improving alignment quality by up to 15% under moderate privacy budgets ({\epsilon}=2-5). We further investigate the interplay between privacy guarantees, alignment efficacy, and computational demands, providing practical guidelines for optimizing these trade-offs.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08849v1
VIDSTAMP: A Temporally-Aware Watermark for Ownership and Integrity in   Video Diffusion Models,"The rapid rise of video diffusion models has enabled the generation of highly realistic and temporally coherent videos, raising critical concerns about content authenticity, provenance, and misuse. Existing watermarking approaches, whether passive, post-hoc, or adapted from image-based techniques, often struggle to withstand video-specific manipulations such as frame insertion, dropping, or reordering, and typically degrade visual quality. In this work, we introduce VIDSTAMP, a watermarking framework that embeds per-frame or per-segment messages directly into the latent space of temporally-aware video diffusion models. By fine-tuning the model's decoder through a two-stage pipeline, first on static image datasets to promote spatial message separation, and then on synthesized video sequences to restore temporal consistency, VIDSTAMP learns to embed high-capacity, flexible watermarks with minimal perceptual impact. Leveraging architectural components such as 3D convolutions and temporal attention, our method imposes no additional inference cost and offers better perceptual quality than prior methods, while maintaining comparable robustness against common distortions and tampering. VIDSTAMP embeds 768 bits per video (48 bits per frame) with a bit accuracy of 95.0%, achieves a log P-value of -166.65 (lower is better), and maintains a video quality score of 0.836, comparable to unwatermarked outputs (0.838) and surpassing prior methods in capacity-quality tradeoffs.

Scaling Up: Revisiting Mining Android Sandboxes at Scale for Malware   Classification,"The widespread use of smartphones in daily life has raised concerns about privacy and security among researchers and practitioners. Privacy issues are generally highly prevalent in mobile applications, particularly targeting the Android platform, the most popular mobile operating system. For this reason, several techniques have been proposed to identify malicious behavior in Android applications, including the Mining Android Sandbox approach (MAS approach), which aims to identify malicious behavior in repackaged Android applications (apps). However, previous empirical studies evaluated the MAS approach using a small dataset consisting of only 102 pairs of original and repackaged apps. This limitation raises questions about the external validity of their findings and whether the MAS approach can be generalized to larger datasets. To address these concerns, this paper presents the results of a replication study focused on evaluating the performance of the MAS approach regarding its capabilities of correctly classifying malware from different families. Unlike previous studies, our research employs a dataset that is an order of magnitude larger, comprising 4,076 pairs of apps covering a more diverse range of Android malware families. Surprisingly, our findings indicate a poor performance of the MAS approach for identifying malware, with the F1-score decreasing from 0.90 for the small dataset used in the previous studies to 0.54 in our more extensive dataset. Upon closer examination, we discovered that certain malware families partially account for the low accuracy of the MAS approach, which fails to classify a repackaged version of an app as malware correctly. Our findings highlight the limitations of the MAS approach, particularly when scaled, and underscore the importance of complementing it with other techniques to detect a broader range of malware effectively.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09501v1
Federated Learning for Cyber Physical Systems: A Comprehensive Survey,"The integration of machine learning (ML) in cyber physical systems (CPS) is a complex task due to the challenges that arise in terms of real-time decision making, safety, reliability, device heterogeneity, and data privacy. There are also open research questions that must be addressed in order to fully realize the potential of ML in CPS. Federated learning (FL), a distributed approach to ML, has become increasingly popular in recent years. It allows models to be trained using data from decentralized sources. This approach has been gaining popularity in the CPS field, as it integrates computer, communication, and physical processes. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the most recent developments of FL-CPS, including the numerous application areas, system topologies, and algorithms developed in recent years. The paper starts by discussing recent advances in both FL and CPS, followed by their integration. Then, the paper compares the application of FL in CPS with its applications in the internet of things (IoT) in further depth to show their connections and distinctions. Furthermore, the article scrutinizes how FL is utilized in critical CPS applications, e.g., intelligent transportation systems, cybersecurity services, smart cities, and smart healthcare solutions. The study also includes critical insights and lessons learned from various FL-CPS implementations. The paper's concluding section delves into significant concerns and suggests avenues for further research in this fast-paced and dynamic era.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04873v1
Robustness Analysis against Adversarial Patch Attacks in Fully Unmanned   Stores,"The advent of convenient and efficient fully unmanned stores equipped with artificial intelligence-based automated checkout systems marks a new era in retail. However, these systems have inherent artificial intelligence security vulnerabilities, which are exploited via adversarial patch attacks, particularly in physical environments. This study demonstrated that adversarial patches can severely disrupt object detection models used in unmanned stores, leading to issues such as theft, inventory discrepancies, and interference. We investigated three types of adversarial patch attacks -- Hiding, Creating, and Altering attacks -- and highlighted their effectiveness. We also introduce the novel color histogram similarity loss function by leveraging attacker knowledge of the color information of a target class object. Besides the traditional confusion-matrix-based attack success rate, we introduce a new bounding-boxes-based metric to analyze the practical impact of these attacks. Starting with attacks on object detection models trained on snack and fruit datasets in a digital environment, we evaluated the effectiveness of adversarial patches in a physical testbed that mimicked a real unmanned store with RGB cameras and realistic conditions. Furthermore, we assessed the robustness of these attacks in black-box scenarios, demonstrating that shadow attacks can enhance success rates of attacks even without direct access to model parameters. Our study underscores the necessity for robust defense strategies to protect unmanned stores from adversarial threats. Highlighting the limitations of the current defense mechanisms in real-time detection systems and discussing various proactive measures, we provide insights into improving the robustness of object detection models and fortifying unmanned retail environments against these attacks.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08835v1
ChainMarks: Securing DNN Watermark with Cryptographic Chain,"With the widespread deployment of deep neural network (DNN) models, dynamic watermarking techniques are being used to protect the intellectual property of model owners. However, recent studies have shown that existing watermarking schemes are vulnerable to watermark removal and ambiguity attacks. Besides, the vague criteria for determining watermark presence further increase the likelihood of such attacks. In this paper, we propose a secure DNN watermarking scheme named ChainMarks, which generates secure and robust watermarks by introducing a cryptographic chain into the trigger inputs and utilizes a two-phase Monte Carlo method for determining watermark presence. First, ChainMarks generates trigger inputs as a watermark dataset by repeatedly applying a hash function over a secret key, where the target labels associated with trigger inputs are generated from the digital signature of model owner. Then, the watermarked model is produced by training a DNN over both the original and watermark datasets. To verify watermarks, we compare the predicted labels of trigger inputs with the target labels and determine ownership with a more accurate decision threshold that considers the classification probability of specific models. Experimental results show that ChainMarks exhibits higher levels of robustness and security compared to state-of-the-art watermarking schemes. With a better marginal utility, ChainMarks provides a higher probability guarantee of watermark presence in DNN models with the same level of watermark accuracy.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04977v1
POISONCRAFT: Practical Poisoning of Retrieval-Augmented Generation for   Large Language Models,"Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various domains, primarily due to their strong capabilities in reasoning and generating human-like text. Despite their impressive performance, LLMs are susceptible to hallucinations, which can lead to incorrect or misleading outputs. This is primarily due to the lack of up-to-date knowledge or domain-specific information. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising approach to mitigate hallucinations by leveraging external knowledge sources. However, the security of RAG systems has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we study a poisoning attack on RAG systems named POISONCRAFT, which can mislead the model to refer to fraudulent websites. Compared to existing poisoning attacks on RAG systems, our attack is more practical as it does not require access to the target user query's info or edit the user query. It not only ensures that injected texts can be retrieved by the model, but also ensures that the LLM will be misled to refer to the injected texts in its response. We demonstrate the effectiveness of POISONCRAFTacross different datasets, retrievers, and language models in RAG pipelines, and show that it remains effective when transferred across retrievers, including black-box systems. Moreover, we present a case study revealing how the attack influences both the retrieval behavior and the step-by-step reasoning trace within the generation model, and further evaluate the robustness of POISONCRAFTunder multiple defense mechanisms. These results validate the practicality of our threat model and highlight a critical security risk for RAG systems deployed in real-world applications. We release our code\footnote{https://github.com/AndyShaw01/PoisonCraft} to support future research on the security and robustness of RAG systems in real-world settings.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06579v1
Unencrypted Flying Objects: Security Lessons from University Small   Satellite Developers and Their Code,"Satellites face a multitude of security risks that set them apart from hardware on Earth. Small satellites may face additional challenges, as they are often developed on a budget and by amateur organizations or universities that do not consider security. We explore the security practices and preferences of small satellite teams, particularly university satellite teams, to understand what barriers exist to building satellites securely. We interviewed 8 university satellite club leaders across 4 clubs in the U.S. and perform a code audit of 3 of these clubs' code repositories. We find that security practices vary widely across teams, but all teams studied had vulnerabilities available to an unprivileged, ground-based attacker. Participants foresee many risks of unsecured small satellites and indicate security shortcomings in industry and government. Lastly, we identify a set of considerations for how to build future small satellites securely, in amateur organizations and beyond.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09038v1
Memory Under Siege: A Comprehensive Survey of Side-Channel Attacks on   Memory,"Side-channel attacks on memory (SCAM) exploit unintended data leaks from memory subsystems to infer sensitive information, posing significant threats to system security. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in memory access patterns, cache behaviors, and other microarchitectural features to bypass traditional security measures. The purpose of this research is to examine SCAM, classify various attack techniques, and evaluate existing defense mechanisms. It guides researchers and industry professionals in improving memory security and mitigating emerging threats. We begin by identifying the major vulnerabilities in the memory system that are frequently exploited in SCAM, such as cache timing, speculative execution, \textit{Rowhammer}, and other sophisticated approaches. Next, we outline a comprehensive taxonomy that systematically classifies these attacks based on their types, target systems, attack vectors, and adversarial capabilities required to execute them. In addition, we review the current landscape of mitigation strategies, emphasizing their strengths and limitations. This work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of memory-based side-channel attacks with the goal of providing significant insights for researchers and practitioners to better understand, detect, and mitigate SCAM risks.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04896v1
M-ary Precomputation-Based Accelerated Scalar Multiplication Algorithms   for Enhanced Elliptic Curve Cryptography,"Efficient scalar multiplication is critical for enhancing the performance of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), especially in applications requiring large-scale or real-time cryptographic operations. This paper proposes an M-ary precomputation-based scalar multiplication algorithm, aiming to optimize both computational efficiency and memory usage. The method reduces the time complexity from $\Theta(Q \log p)$ to $\Theta\left(\frac{Q \log p}{\log Q}\right)$ and achieves a memory complexity of $\Theta\left(\frac{Q \log p}{\log^2 Q}\right)$. Experiments on ElGamal encryption and NS3-based communication simulations validate its effectiveness. On secp256k1, the proposed method achieves up to a 59\% reduction in encryption time and 30\% memory savings. In network simulations, the binary-optimized variant reduces communication time by 22.1\% on secp384r1 and simulation time by 25.4\% on secp521r1. The results demonstrate the scalability, efficiency, and practical applicability of the proposed algorithm. The source code will be publicly released upon acceptance.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01845v1
BadLingual: A Novel Lingual-Backdoor Attack against Large Language   Models,"In this paper, we present a new form of backdoor attack against Large Language Models (LLMs): lingual-backdoor attacks. The key novelty of lingual-backdoor attacks is that the language itself serves as the trigger to hijack the infected LLMs to generate inflammatory speech. They enable the precise targeting of a specific language-speaking group, exacerbating racial discrimination by malicious entities. We first implement a baseline lingual-backdoor attack, which is carried out by poisoning a set of training data for specific downstream tasks through translation into the trigger language. However, this baseline attack suffers from poor task generalization and is impractical in real-world settings. To address this challenge, we design BadLingual, a novel task-agnostic lingual-backdoor, capable of triggering any downstream tasks within the chat LLMs, regardless of the specific questions of these tasks. We design a new approach using PPL-constrained Greedy Coordinate Gradient-based Search (PGCG) based adversarial training to expand the decision boundary of lingual-backdoor, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of lingual-backdoor across various tasks. We perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed attacks. Specifically, the baseline attack achieves an ASR of over 90% on the specified tasks. However, its ASR reaches only 37.61% across six tasks in the task-agnostic scenario. In contrast, BadLingual brings up to 37.35% improvement over the baseline. Our study sheds light on a new perspective of vulnerabilities in LLMs with multilingual capabilities and is expected to promote future research on the potential defenses to enhance the LLMs' robustness",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03501v1
User Behavior Analysis in Privacy Protection with Large Language Models:   A Study on Privacy Preferences with Limited Data,"With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), user privacy protection has become a significant research topic. Existing privacy preference modeling methods often rely on large-scale user data, making effective privacy preference analysis challenging in data-limited environments. This study explores how LLMs can analyze user behavior related to privacy protection in scenarios with limited data and proposes a method that integrates Few-shot Learning and Privacy Computing to model user privacy preferences. The research utilizes anonymized user privacy settings data, survey responses, and simulated data, comparing the performance of traditional modeling approaches with LLM-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that, even with limited data, LLMs significantly improve the accuracy of privacy preference modeling. Additionally, incorporating Differential Privacy and Federated Learning further reduces the risk of user data exposure. The findings provide new insights into the application of LLMs in privacy protection and offer theoretical support for advancing privacy computing and user behavior analysis.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06305v1
Learning from the Good Ones: Risk Profiling-Based Defenses Against   Evasion Attacks on DNNs,"Safety-critical applications such as healthcare and autonomous vehicles use deep neural networks (DNN) to make predictions and infer decisions. DNNs are susceptible to evasion attacks, where an adversary crafts a malicious data instance to trick the DNN into making wrong decisions at inference time. Existing defenses that protect DNNs against evasion attacks are either static or dynamic. Static defenses are computationally efficient but do not adapt to the evolving threat landscape, while dynamic defenses are adaptable but suffer from an increased computational overhead. To combine the best of both worlds, in this paper, we propose a novel risk profiling framework that uses a risk-aware strategy to selectively train static defenses using victim instances that exhibit the most resilient features and are hence more resilient against an evasion attack. We hypothesize that training existing defenses on instances that are less vulnerable to the attack enhances the adversarial detection rate by reducing false negatives. We evaluate the efficacy of our risk-aware selective training strategy on a blood glucose management system that demonstrates how training static anomaly detectors indiscriminately may result in an increased false negative rate, which could be life-threatening in safety-critical applications. Our experiments show that selective training on the less vulnerable patients achieves a recall increase of up to 27.5\% with minimal impact on precision compared to indiscriminate training.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06477v1
Think Twice Before You Act: Enhancing Agent Behavioral Safety with   Thought Correction,"LLM-based autonomous agents possess capabilities such as reasoning, tool invocation, and environment interaction, enabling the execution of complex multi-step tasks. The internal reasoning process, i.e., thought, of behavioral trajectory significantly influences tool usage and subsequent actions but can introduce potential risks. Even minor deviations in the agent's thought may trigger cascading effects leading to irreversible safety incidents. To address the safety alignment challenges in long-horizon behavioral trajectories, we propose Thought-Aligner, a plug-in dynamic thought correction module. Utilizing a lightweight and resource-efficient model, Thought-Aligner corrects each high-risk thought on the fly before each action execution. The corrected thought is then reintroduced to the agent, ensuring safer subsequent decisions and tool interactions. Importantly, Thought-Aligner modifies only the reasoning phase without altering the underlying agent framework, making it easy to deploy and widely applicable to various agent frameworks. To train the Thought-Aligner model, we construct an instruction dataset across ten representative scenarios and simulate ReAct execution trajectories, generating 5,000 diverse instructions and more than 11,400 safe and unsafe thought pairs. The model is fine-tuned using contrastive learning techniques. Experiments across three agent safety benchmarks involving 12 different LLMs demonstrate that Thought-Aligner raises agent behavioral safety from approximately 50% in the unprotected setting to 90% on average. Additionally, Thought-Aligner maintains response latency below 100ms with minimal resource usage, demonstrating its capability for efficient deployment, broad applicability, and timely responsiveness. This method thus provides a practical dynamic safety solution for the LLM-based agents.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11063v2
An Agent-Based Modeling Approach to Free-Text Keyboard Dynamics for   Continuous Authentication,"Continuous authentication systems leveraging free-text keyboard dynamics offer a promising additional layer of security in a multifactor authentication setup that can be used in a transparent way with no impact on user experience. This study investigates the efficacy of behavioral biometrics by employing an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate diverse typing profiles across mechanical and membrane keyboards. Specifically, we generated synthetic keystroke data from five unique agents, capturing features related to dwell time, flight time, and error rates within sliding 5-second windows updated every second. Two machine learning approaches, One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) and Random Forest (RF), were evaluated for user verification. Results revealed a stark contrast in performance: while One-Class SVM failed to differentiate individual users within each group, Random Forest achieved robust intra-keyboard user recognition (Accuracy > 0.7) but struggled to generalize across keyboards for the same user, highlighting the significant impact of keyboard hardware on typing behavior. These findings suggest that: (1) keyboard-specific user profiles may be necessary for reliable authentication, and (2) ensemble methods like RF outperform One-Class SVM in capturing fine-grained user-specific patterns.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05015v1
"Securing the Future of IVR: AI-Driven Innovation with Agile Security,   Data Regulation, and Ethical AI Integration","The rapid digitalization of communication systems has elevated Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technologies to become critical interfaces for customer engagement. With Artificial Intelligence (AI) now driving these platforms, ensuring secure, compliant, and ethically designed development practices is more imperative than ever. AI-powered IVRs leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to personalize interactions, automate service delivery, and optimize user experiences. However, these innovations expose systems to heightened risks, including data privacy breaches, AI decision opacity, and model security vulnerabilities. This paper analyzes the evolution of IVRs from static code-based designs to adaptive AI-driven systems, presenting a cybersecurity-centric perspective. We propose a practical governance framework that embeds agile security principles, compliance with global data legislation, and user-centric ethics. Emphasizing privacy-by-design, adaptive risk modeling, and transparency, the paper argues that ethical AI integration is not a feature but a strategic imperative. Through this multidimensional lens, we highlight how modern IVRs can transition from communication tools to intelligent, secure, and accountable digital frontlines-resilient against emerging threats and aligned with societal expectations.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01514v1
Lightweight Hybrid Block-Stream Cryptographic Algorithm for the Internet   of Things,"In this thesis, a novel lightweight hybrid encryption algorithm named SEPAR is proposed, featuring a 16-bit block length and a 128-bit initialization vector. The algorithm is designed specifically for application in Internet of Things (IoT) technology devices. The design concept of this algorithm is based on the integration of a pseudo-random permutation function and a pseudo-random generator function. This intelligent combination not only enhances the algorithm's resistance against cryptographic attacks but also improves its processing speed. The security analyses conducted on the algorithm, along with the results of NIST statistical tests, confirm its robustness against most common and advanced cryptographic attacks, including linear and differential attacks. The proposed algorithm has been implemented on various software platform architectures. The software implementation was carried out on three platforms: 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit architectures. A comparative analysis with the BORON algorithm on a 32-bit ARM processor indicates a performance improvement of 42.25%. Furthermore, implementation results on 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers demonstrate performance improvements of 87.91% and 98.01% respectively, compared to the PRESENT cipher.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08840v1
Triple-identity Authentication: The Future of Secure Access,"In a typical authentication process, the local system verifies the user's identity using a stored hash value generated by a cross-system hash algorithm. This article shifts the research focus from traditional password encryption to the establishment of gatekeeping mechanisms for effective interactions between a system and the outside world. Here, we propose a triple-identity authentication system to achieve this goal. Specifically, this local system opens the inner structure of its hash algorithm to all user credentials, including the login name, login password, and authentication password. When a login credential is entered, the local system hashes it and then creates a unique identifier using intermediate hash elements randomly selected from the open algorithm. Importantly, this locally generated unique identifier (rather than the stored hash produced by the open algorithm) is utilized to verify the user's combined identity, which is generated by combining the entered credential with the International Mobile Equipment Identity and the International Mobile Subscriber Identity. The verification process is implemented at each interaction point: the login name field, the login password field, and the server's authentication point. Thus, within the context of this triple-identity authentication system, we establish a robust gatekeeping mechanism for system interactions, ultimately providing a level of security that is equivalent to multi-factor authentication.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02004v2
"Federated Large Language Models: Feasibility, Robustness, Security and   Future Directions","The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising solution for joint training on distributed data while preserving privacy and addressing data silo issues. However, this emerging field, known as Federated Large Language Models (FLLM), faces significant challenges, including communication and computation overheads, heterogeneity, privacy and security concerns. Current research has primarily focused on the feasibility of FLLM, but future trends are expected to emphasize enhancing system robustness and security. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in FLLM, examining challenges from four critical perspectives: feasibility, robustness, security, and future directions. We present an exhaustive survey of existing studies on FLLM feasibility, introduce methods to enhance robustness in the face of resource, data, and task heterogeneity, and analyze novel risks associated with this integration, including privacy threats and security challenges. We also review the latest developments in defense mechanisms and explore promising future research directions, such as few-shot learning, machine unlearning, and IP protection. This survey highlights the pressing need for further research to enhance system robustness and security while addressing the unique challenges posed by the integration of FL and LLM.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08830v1
Shielding Latent Face Representations From Privacy Attacks,"In today's data-driven analytics landscape, deep learning has become a powerful tool, with latent representations, known as embeddings, playing a central role in several applications. In the face analytics domain, such embeddings are commonly used for biometric recognition (e.g., face identification). However, these embeddings, or templates, can inadvertently expose sensitive attributes such as age, gender, and ethnicity. Leaking such information can compromise personal privacy and affect civil liberty and human rights. To address these concerns, we introduce a multi-layer protection framework for embeddings. It consists of a sequence of operations: (a) encrypting embeddings using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), and (b) hashing them using irreversible feature manifold hashing. Unlike conventional encryption methods, FHE enables computations directly on encrypted data, allowing downstream analytics while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. To reduce the overhead of encrypted processing, we employ embedding compression. Our proposed method shields latent representations of sensitive data from leaking private attributes (such as age and gender) while retaining essential functional capabilities (such as face identification). Extensive experiments on two datasets using two face encoders demonstrate that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art privacy protection methods.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12688v1
"Fixing 7,400 Bugs for 1$: Cheap Crash-Site Program Repair","The rapid advancement of bug-finding techniques has led to the discovery of more vulnerabilities than developers can reasonably fix, creating an urgent need for effective Automated Program Repair (APR) methods. However, the complexity of modern bugs often makes precise root cause analysis difficult and unreliable. To address this challenge, we propose crash-site repair to simplify the repair task while still mitigating the risk of exploitation. In addition, we introduce a template-guided patch generation approach that significantly reduces the token cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining both efficiency and effectiveness.   We implement our prototype system, WILLIAMT, and evaluate it against state-of-the-art APR tools. Our results show that, when combined with the top-performing agent CodeRover-S, WILLIAMT reduces token cost by 45.9% and increases the bug-fixing rate to 73.5% (+29.6%) on ARVO, a ground-truth open source software vulnerabilities benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that WILLIAMT can function effectively even without access to frontier LLMs: even a local model running on a Mac M4 Mini achieves a reasonable repair rate. These findings highlight the broad applicability and scalability of WILLIAMT.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13103v1

GDNTT: an Area-Efficient Parallel NTT Accelerator Using Glitch-Driven   Near-Memory Computing and Reconfigurable 10T SRAM,"With the rapid advancement of quantum computing technology, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has emerged as a pivotal direction for next-generation encryption standards. Among these, lattice-based cryptographic schemes rely heavily on the fast Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) over polynomial rings, whose performance directly determines encryption/decryption throughput and energy efficiency. However, existing software-based NTT implementations struggle to meet the real-time performance and low-power requirements of IoT and edge devices. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an area-efficient highly parallel NTT accelerator with glitch-driven near-memory computing (GDNTT). The design integrates a 10T SRAM for data storage, enabling flexible row/column data access and streamlining circuit mapping strategies. Furthermore, a glitch generator is incorporated into the near-memory computing unit, significantly reducing the latency of butterfly operations. Evaluation results show that the proposed NTT accelerator achieves a 1.5~28* improvement in throughput-per-area compared to the state-of-the-art.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08162v1
Enhanced Multiuser CSI-Based Physical Layer Authentication Based on   Information Reconciliation,"This paper presents a physical layer authentication (PLA) technique using information reconciliation in multiuser communication systems. A cost-effective solution for low-end Internet of Things networks can be provided by PLA. In this work, we develop an information reconciliation scheme using Polar codes along with a quantization strategy that employs an arbitrary number of bits to enhance the performance of PLA.

AutoPentest: Enhancing Vulnerability Management With Autonomous LLM   Agents,"A recent area of increasing research is the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in penetration testing, which promises to reduce costs and thus allow for higher frequency. We conduct a review of related work, identifying best practices and common evaluation issues. We then present AutoPentest, an application for performing black-box penetration tests with a high degree of autonomy. AutoPentest is based on the LLM GPT-4o from OpenAI and the LLM agent framework LangChain. It can perform complex multi-step tasks, augmented by external tools and knowledge bases. We conduct a study on three capture-the-flag style Hack The Box (HTB) machines, comparing our implementation AutoPentest with the baseline approach of manually using the ChatGPT-4o user interface. Both approaches are able to complete 15-25 % of the subtasks on the HTB machines, with AutoPentest slightly outperforming ChatGPT. We measure a total cost of \$96.20 US when using AutoPentest across all experiments, while a one-month subscription to ChatGPT Plus costs \$20. The results show that further implementation efforts and the use of more powerful LLMs released in the future are likely to make this a viable part of vulnerability management.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10321v1
PRUNE: A Patching Based Repair Framework for Certiffable Unlearning of   Neural Networks,"It is often desirable to remove (a.k.a. unlearn) a speciffc part of the training data from a trained neural network model. A typical application scenario is to protect the data holder's right to be forgotten, which has been promoted by many recent regulation rules. Existing unlearning methods involve training alternative models with remaining data, which may be costly and challenging to verify from the data holder or a thirdparty auditor's perspective. In this work, we provide a new angle and propose a novel unlearning approach by imposing carefully crafted ""patch"" on the original neural network to achieve targeted ""forgetting"" of the requested data to delete. Speciffcally, inspired by the research line of neural network repair, we propose to strategically seek a lightweight minimum ""patch"" for unlearning a given data point with certiffable guarantee. Furthermore, to unlearn a considerable amount of data points (or an entire class), we propose to iteratively select a small subset of representative data points to unlearn, which achieves the effect of unlearning the whole set. Extensive experiments on multiple categorical datasets demonstrates our approach's effectiveness, achieving measurable unlearning while preserving the model's performance and being competitive in efffciency and memory consumption compared to various baseline methods.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06520v1
"Nosy Layers, Noisy Fixes: Tackling DRAs in Federated Learning Systems   using Explainable AI","Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative model training while keeping client data decentralized and private. However, it is vulnerable to Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRA) such as ""LoKI"" and ""Robbing the Fed"", where malicious models sent from the server to the client can reconstruct sensitive user data. To counter this, we introduce DRArmor, a novel defense mechanism that integrates Explainable AI with targeted detection and mitigation strategies for DRA. Unlike existing defenses that focus on the entire model, DRArmor identifies and addresses the root cause (i.e., malicious layers within the model that send gradients with malicious intent) by analyzing their contribution to the output and detecting inconsistencies in gradient values. Once these malicious layers are identified, DRArmor applies defense techniques such as noise injection, pixelation, and pruning to these layers rather than the whole model, minimizing the attack surface and preserving client data privacy. We evaluate DRArmor's performance against the advanced LoKI attack across diverse datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, in a 200-client FL setup. Our results demonstrate DRArmor's effectiveness in mitigating data leakage, achieving high True Positive and True Negative Rates of 0.910 and 0.890, respectively. Additionally, DRArmor maintains an average accuracy of 87%, effectively protecting client privacy without compromising model performance. Compared to existing defense mechanisms, DRArmor reduces the data leakage rate by 62.5% with datasets containing 500 samples per client.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10942v1
DPolicy: Managing Privacy Risks Across Multiple Releases with   Differential Privacy,"Differential Privacy (DP) has emerged as a robust framework for privacy-preserving data releases and has been successfully applied in high-profile cases, such as the 2020 US Census. However, in organizational settings, the use of DP remains largely confined to isolated data releases. This approach restricts the potential of DP to serve as a framework for comprehensive privacy risk management at an organizational level. Although one might expect that the cumulative privacy risk of isolated releases could be assessed using DP's compositional property, in practice, individual DP guarantees are frequently tailored to specific releases, making it difficult to reason about their interaction or combined impact. At the same time, less tailored DP guarantees, which compose more easily, also offer only limited insight because they lead to excessively large privacy budgets that convey limited meaning. To address these limitations, we present DPolicy, a system designed to manage cumulative privacy risks across multiple data releases using DP. Unlike traditional approaches that treat each release in isolation or rely on a single (global) DP guarantee, our system employs a flexible framework that considers multiple DP guarantees simultaneously, reflecting the diverse contexts and scopes typical of real-world DP deployments. DPolicy introduces a high-level policy language to formalize privacy guarantees, making traditionally implicit assumptions on scopes and contexts explicit. By deriving the DP guarantees required to enforce complex privacy semantics from these high-level policies, DPolicy enables fine-grained privacy risk management on an organizational scale. We implement and evaluate DPolicy, demonstrating how it mitigates privacy risks that can emerge without comprehensive, organization-wide privacy risk management.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06747v1
Timestamp Manipulation: Timestamp-based Nakamoto-style Blockchains are   Vulnerable,"We introduce two advanced attack strategies, the Unrestricted Uncle Maker (UUM) Attack and the Staircase-Unrestricted Uncle Maker (SUUM) Attack, which fundamentally threaten the security of timestamp-based Nakamoto-style blockchains by inflicting permanent systemic harm. Unlike prior work that merely enhances adversarial rewards, these attacks exploit vulnerabilities in timestamp manipulation and fork selection rules to irreversibly destabilize blockchain fairness and incentive mechanisms. Specifically, the SUUM attack enables adversaries to persistently launch attacks at zero cost, eliminating constraints on block withholding and risk-free conditions, while systematically maximizing rewards through coordinated timestamp adjustments and strategic block release.   Our analysis demonstrates that SUUM adversaries achieve disproportionate reward advantages over both UUM and the original Riskless Uncle Maker (RUM) Attack [CCS '23], with all three strategies surpassing honest mining. Crucially, SUUM's cost-free persistence allows adversaries to indefinitely drain rewards from honest participants by maintaining minimal difficulty risks through precise timestamp manipulation. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle: adversaries amplify their profits while suppressing honest returns, thereby permanently eroding the protocol's security assumptions. Through rigorous theoretical modeling and simulations, we validate how SUUM's combination of timestamp tampering, block withholding, and difficulty risk control enables unmitigated exploitation of consensus mechanisms. This work underscores the existential risks posed by timestamp-based Nakamoto-style protocols and advocates urgent countermeasures to ensure long-term stability.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05328v2

ai.txt: A Domain-Specific Language for Guiding AI Interactions with the   Internet,"We introduce ai.txt, a novel domain-specific language (DSL) designed to explicitly regulate interactions between AI models, agents, and web content, addressing critical limitations of the widely adopted robots.txt standard. As AI increasingly engages with online materials for tasks such as training, summarization, and content modification, existing regulatory methods lack the necessary granularity and semantic expressiveness to ensure ethical and legal compliance. ai.txt extends traditional URL-based access controls by enabling precise element-level regulations and incorporating natural language instructions interpretable by AI systems. To facilitate practical deployment, we provide an integrated development environment with code autocompletion and automatic XML generation.

Our approach aims to aid the governance of AI-Internet interactions, promoting responsible AI use in digital ecosystems.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07834v1
Defending against Indirect Prompt Injection by Instruction Detection,"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external sources is becoming increasingly common, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) being a prominent example. However, this integration introduces vulnerabilities of Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks, where hidden instructions embedded in external data can manipulate LLMs into executing unintended or harmful actions. We recognize that the success of IPI attacks fundamentally relies in the presence of instructions embedded within external content, which can alter the behavioral state of LLMs. Can effectively detecting such state changes help us defend against IPI attacks? In this paper, we propose a novel approach that takes external data as input and leverages the behavioral state of LLMs during both forward and backward propagation to detect potential IPI attacks. Specifically, we demonstrate that the hidden states and gradients from intermediate layers provide highly discriminative features for instruction detection. By effectively combining these features, our approach achieves a detection accuracy of 99.60\% in the in-domain setting and 96.90\% in the out-of-domain setting, while reducing the attack success rate to just 0.12\% on the BIPIA benchmark.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06311v1
Adversarial Attack on Large Language Models using Exponentiated Gradient   Descent,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used, understanding them systematically is key to improving their safety and realizing their full potential. Although many models are aligned using techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), they are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. Some of the existing adversarial attack methods search for discrete tokens that may jailbreak a target model while others try to optimize the continuous space represented by the tokens of the model's vocabulary. While techniques based on the discrete space may prove to be inefficient, optimization of continuous token embeddings requires projections to produce discrete tokens, which might render them ineffective. To fully utilize the constraints and the structures of the space, we develop an intrinsic optimization technique using exponentiated gradient descent with the Bregman projection method to ensure that the optimized one-hot encoding always stays within the probability simplex. We prove the convergence of the technique and implement an efficient algorithm that is effective in jailbreaking several widely used LLMs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique using five open-source LLMs on four openly available datasets. The results show that the technique achieves a higher success rate with great efficiency compared to three other state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques.

A Rusty Link in the AI Supply Chain: Detecting Evil Configurations in   Model Repositories,"Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred the development of diverse AI applications from code generation and video editing to text generation; however, AI supply chains such as Hugging Face, which host pretrained models and their associated configuration files contributed by the public, face significant security challenges; in particular, configuration files originally intended to set up models by specifying parameters and initial settings can be exploited to execute unauthorized code, yet research has largely overlooked their security compared to that of the models themselves; in this work, we present the first comprehensive study of malicious configurations on Hugging Face, identifying three attack scenarios (file, website, and repository operations) that expose inherent risks; to address these threats, we introduce CONFIGSCAN, an LLM-based tool that analyzes configuration files in the context of their associated runtime code and critical libraries, effectively detecting suspicious elements with low false positive rates and high accuracy; our extensive evaluation uncovers thousands of suspicious repositories and configuration files, underscoring the urgent need for enhanced security validation in AI model hosting platforms.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01067v1

Security through the Eyes of AI: How Visualization is Shaping Malware   Detection,"Malware, a persistent cybersecurity threat, increasingly targets interconnected digital systems such as desktop, mobile, and IoT platforms through sophisticated attack vectors. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, attackers compromise the integrity and resilience of modern digital ecosystems. To address this risk, security experts actively employ Machine Learning or Deep Learning-based strategies, integrating static, dynamic, or hybrid approaches to categorize malware instances.

SKALD: Scalable K-Anonymisation for Large Datasets,"Data privacy and anonymisation are critical concerns in today's data-driven society, particularly when handling personal and sensitive user data. Regulatory frameworks worldwide recommend privacy-preserving protocols such as k-anonymisation to de-identify releases of tabular data. Available hardware resources provide an upper bound on the maximum size of dataset that can be processed at a time. Large datasets with sizes exceeding this upper bound must be broken up into smaller data chunks for processing. In these cases, standard k-anonymisation tools such as ARX can only operate on a per-chunk basis. This paper proposes SKALD, a novel algorithm for performing k-anonymisation on large datasets with limited RAM. Our SKALD algorithm offers multi-fold performance improvement over standard k-anonymisation methods by extracting and combining sufficient statistics from each chunk during processing to ensure successful k-anonymisation while providing better utility.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03529v1
Dark LLMs: The Growing Threat of Unaligned AI Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly reshape modern life, advancing fields from healthcare to education and beyond. However, alongside their remarkable capabilities lies a significant threat: the susceptibility of these models to jailbreaking. The fundamental vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks stems from the very data they learn from. As long as this training data includes unfiltered, problematic, or 'dark' content, the models can inherently learn undesirable patterns or weaknesses that allow users to circumvent their intended safety controls. Our research identifies the growing threat posed by dark LLMs models deliberately designed without ethical guardrails or modified through jailbreak techniques. In our research, we uncovered a universal jailbreak attack that effectively compromises multiple state-of-the-art models, enabling them to answer almost any question and produce harmful outputs upon request. The main idea of our attack was published online over seven months ago. However, many of the tested LLMs were still vulnerable to this attack. Despite our responsible disclosure efforts, responses from major LLM providers were often inadequate, highlighting a concerning gap in industry practices regarding AI safety. As model training becomes more accessible and cheaper, and as open-source LLMs proliferate, the risk of widespread misuse escalates. Without decisive intervention, LLMs may continue democratizing access to dangerous knowledge, posing greater risks than anticipated.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10066v1
"UK Finfluencers: Exploring Content, Reach, and Responsibility","The rise of social media financial influencers (finfluencers) has significantly transformed the personal finance landscape, making financial advice and insights more accessible to a broader and younger audience. By leveraging digital platforms, these influencers have contributed to the democratization of financial literacy. However, the line between education and promotion is often blurred, as many finfluencers lack formal financial qualifications, raising concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the information they share. This study investigates the patterns and behaviours of finfluencers in the UK on TikTok, focusing not on individual actions but on broader trends and the interactions between influencers and their followers. The aim is to identify common engagement patterns and propose guidelines that can help protect the public from potential financial harm. Specifically, the paper contributes a detailed analysis of finfluencer content categorization, sentiment trends, and the prevalence and role of disclaimers, offering empirical insights that inform recommendations for safer and more transparent financial communication on social media.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01941v2
An Approach for Handling Missing Attribute Values in Attribute-Based   Access Control Policy Mining,"Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) enables highly expressive and flexible access decisions by considering a wide range of contextual attributes. ABAC policies use logical expressions that combine these attributes, allowing for precise and context-aware control. Algorithms that mine ABAC policies from legacy access control systems can significantly reduce the costs associated with migrating to ABAC. However, a major challenge in this process is handling incomplete entity information, where some attribute values are missing.   This paper introduces an approach that enhances the policy mining process by predicting or inferring missing attribute values. This is accomplished by employing a contextual clustering technique that groups entities according to their known attributes, which are then used to analyze and refine authorization decisions. By effectively managing incomplete data, our approach provides security administrators with a valuable tool to improve their attribute data and ensure a smoother, more efficient transition to ABAC.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01873v1
Towards Quantum Resilience: Data-Driven Migration Strategy Design,"The advancements in quantum computing are a threat to classical cryptographic systems. The traditional cryptographic methods that utilize factorization-based or discrete-logarithm-based algorithms, such as RSA and ECC, are some of these. This paper thoroughly investigates the vulnerabilities of traditional cryptographic methods against quantum attacks and provides a decision-support framework to help organizations in recommending mitigation plans and determining appropriate transition strategies to post-quantum cryptography. A semi-synthetic dataset, consisting of key features such as key size, network complexity, and sensitivity levels, is crafted, with each configuration labeled according to its recommended mitigation plan. Using decision tree and random forest models, a classifier is trained to recommend appropriate mitigation/transition plans such as continuous monitoring, scheduled transitions, and immediate hybrid implementation. The proposed approach introduces a data-driven and dynamic solution for organizations to assess the scale of the migration, specifying a structured roadmap toward quantum resilience. The results highlight important features that influence strategy decisions and support actionable recommendations for cryptographic modernization based on system context.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05959v1
"ABAC Lab: An Interactive Platform for Attribute-based Access Control   Policy Analysis, Tools, and Datasets","Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) provides expressiveness and flexibility, making it a compelling model for enforcing fine-grained access control policies. To facilitate the transition to ABAC, extensive research has been conducted to develop methodologies, frameworks, and tools that assist policy administrators in adapting the model. Despite these efforts, challenges remain in the availability and benchmarking of ABAC datasets. Specifically, there is a lack of clarity on how datasets can be systematically acquired, no standardized benchmarking practices to evaluate existing methodologies and their effectiveness, and limited access to real-world datasets suitable for policy analysis and testing.   This paper introduces ABAC Lab, an interactive platform that addresses these challenges by integrating existing ABAC policy datasets with analytical tools for policy evaluation. Additionally, we present two new ABAC datasets derived from real-world case studies. ABAC Lab serves as a valuable resource for both researchers studying ABAC policies and policy administrators seeking to adopt ABAC within their organizations. By offering an environment for dataset exploration and policy analysis, ABAC Lab facilitates research, aids policy administrators in transitioning to ABAC, and promotes a more structured approach to ABAC policy evaluation and development.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08209v1
Good News for Script Kiddies? Evaluating Large Language Models for   Automated Exploit Generation,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks, raising concerns about their potential for automated exploit generation (AEG). This paper presents the first systematic study on LLMs' effectiveness in AEG, evaluating both their cooperativeness and technical proficiency. To mitigate dataset bias, we introduce a benchmark with refactored versions of five software security labs. Additionally, we design an LLM-based attacker to systematically prompt LLMs for exploit generation. Our experiments reveal that GPT-4 and GPT-4o exhibit high cooperativeness, comparable to uncensored models, while Llama3 is the most resistant. However, no model successfully generates exploits for refactored labs, though GPT-4o's minimal errors highlight the potential for LLM-driven AEG advancements.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01065v1
Capability-Based Multi-Tenant Access Management in Crowdsourced Drone   Services,"We propose a capability-based access control method that leverages OAuth 2.0 and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to share resources in crowdsourced drone services. VCs securely encode claims about entities, offering flexibility. However, standardized protocols for VCs are lacking, limiting their adoption. To address this, we integrate VCs into OAuth 2.0, creating a novel access token. This token encapsulates VCs using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and employs JWT-based methods for proof of possession. Our method streamlines VC verification with JSON Web Signatures (JWS) requires only minor adjustments to current OAuth 2.0 systems. Furthermore, in order to increase security and efficiency in multi-tenant environments, we provide a novel protocol for VC creation that makes use of the OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant. Using VCs as access tokens enhances OAuth 2.0, supporting long-term use and efficient data management. This system aids bushfire management authorities by ensuring high availability, enhanced privacy, and improved data portability. It supports multi-tenancy, allowing drone operators to control data access policies in a decentralized environment.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01048v1
A Taxonomy of Attacks and Defenses in Split Learning,"Split Learning (SL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed deep learning, allowing resource-constrained clients to offload portions of their model computation to servers while maintaining collaborative learning. However, recent research has demonstrated that SL remains vulnerable to a range of privacy and security threats, including information leakage, model inversion, and adversarial attacks. While various defense mechanisms have been proposed, a systematic understanding of the attack landscape and corresponding countermeasures is still lacking. In this study, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of attacks and defenses in SL, categorizing them along three key dimensions: employed strategies, constraints, and effectiveness. Furthermore, we identify key open challenges and research gaps in SL based on our systematization, highlighting potential future directions.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05872v1

Security and Privacy Measurement on Chinese Consumer IoT Traffic based   on Device Lifecycle,"In recent years, consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become widely used in daily life. With the popularity of devices, related security and privacy risks arise at the same time as they collect user-related data and transmit it to various service providers. Although China accounts for a larger share of the consumer IoT industry, current analyses on consumer IoT device traffic primarily focus on regions such as Europe, the United States, and Australia. Research on China, however, is currently rather rare. This study constructs the first large-scale dataset about consumer IoT device traffic in China. Specifically, we propose a fine-grained traffic collection guidance covering the entire lifecycle of consumer IoT devices, gathering traffic from 70 devices spanning 36 brands and 8 device categories. Based on this dataset, we analyze traffic destinations and encryption practices across different device types during the entire lifecycle and compare the findings with the results of other regions. Compared to other regions, our results show that consumer IoT devices in China rely more on domestic services and overally perform better in terms of encryption practices. However, there are still 20/35 devices improperly conduct certificate validation, and 5/70 devices use insecure encryption protocols. To facilitate future research, we open-source our traffic collection guidance and make our dataset publicly available.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09929v1
DP-TRAE: A Dual-Phase Merging Transferable Reversible Adversarial   Example for Image Privacy Protection,"In the field of digital security, Reversible Adversarial Examples (RAE) combine adversarial attacks with reversible data hiding techniques to effectively protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized analysis by malicious Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, existing RAE techniques primarily focus on white-box attacks, lacking a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness in black-box scenarios. This limitation impedes their broader deployment in complex, dynamic environments. Further more, traditional black-box attacks are often characterized by poor transferability and high query costs, significantly limiting their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Phase Merging Transferable Reversible Attack method, which generates highly transferable initial adversarial perturbations in a white-box model and employs a memory augmented black-box strategy to effectively mislead target mod els. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving a 99.0% attack success rate and 100% recovery rate in black-box scenarios, highlighting its robustness in privacy protection. Moreover, we successfully implemented a black-box attack on a commercial model, further substantiating the potential of this approach for practical use.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06860v1
An In-kernel Forensics Engine for Investigating Evasive Attacks,"Over the years, adversarial attempts against critical services have become more effective and sophisticated in launching low-profile attacks. This trend has always been concerning. However, an even more alarming trend is the increasing difficulty of collecting relevant evidence about these attacks and the involved threat actors in the early stages before significant damage is done. This issue puts defenders at a significant disadvantage, as it becomes exceedingly difficult to understand the attack details and formulate an appropriate response. Developing robust forensics tools to collect evidence about modern threats has never been easy. One main challenge is to provide a robust trade-off between achieving sufficient visibility while leaving minimal detectable artifacts. This paper will introduce LASE, an open-source Low-Artifact Forensics Engine to perform threat analysis and forensics in Windows operating system. LASE augments current analysis tools by providing detailed, system-wide monitoring capabilities while minimizing detectable artifacts. We designed multiple deployment scenarios, showing LASE's potential in evidence gathering and threat reasoning in a real-world setting. By making LASE and its execution trace data available to the broader research community, this work encourages further exploration in the field by reducing the engineering costs for threat analysis and building a longitudinal behavioral analysis catalog for diverse security domains.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06498v2
LLMs unlock new paths to monetizing exploits,"We argue that Large language models (LLMs) will soon alter the economics of cyberattacks. Instead of attacking the most commonly used software and monetizing exploits by targeting the lowest common denominator among victims, LLMs enable adversaries to launch tailored attacks on a user-by-user basis. On the exploitation front, instead of human attackers manually searching for one difficult-to-identify bug in a product with millions of users, LLMs can find thousands of easy-to-identify bugs in products with thousands of users. And on the monetization front, instead of generic ransomware that always performs the same attack (encrypt all your data and request payment to decrypt), an LLM-driven ransomware attack could tailor the ransom demand based on the particular content of each exploited device.   We show that these two attacks (and several others) are imminently practical using state-of-the-art LLMs. For example, we show that without any human intervention, an LLM finds highly sensitive personal information in the Enron email dataset (e.g., an executive having an affair with another employee) that could be used for blackmail. While some of our attacks are still too expensive to scale widely today, the incentives to implement these attacks will only increase as LLMs get cheaper. Thus, we argue that LLMs create a need for new defense-in-depth approaches.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11449v1
Apple's Synthetic Defocus Noise Pattern: Characterization and Forensic   Applications,"iPhone portrait-mode images contain a distinctive pattern in out-of-focus regions simulating the bokeh effect, which we term Apple's Synthetic Defocus Noise Pattern (SDNP). If overlooked, this pattern can interfere with blind forensic analyses, especially PRNU-based camera source verification, as noted in earlier works. Since Apple's SDNP remains underexplored, we provide a detailed characterization, proposing a method for its precise estimation, modeling its dependence on scene brightness, ISO settings, and other factors. Leveraging this characterization, we explore forensic applications of the SDNP, including traceability of portrait-mode images across iPhone models and iOS versions in open-set scenarios, assessing its robustness under post-processing. Furthermore, we show that masking SDNP-affected regions in PRNU-based camera source verification significantly reduces false positives, overcoming a critical limitation in camera attribution, and improving state-of-the-art techniques.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07380v1
DMRL: Data- and Model-aware Reward Learning for Data Extraction,"Large language models (LLMs) are inherently vulnerable to unintended privacy breaches. Consequently, systematic red-teaming research is essential for developing robust defense mechanisms. However, current data extraction methods suffer from several limitations: (1) rely on dataset duplicates (addressable via deduplication), (2) depend on prompt engineering (now countered by detection and defense), and (3) rely on random-search adversarial generation. To address these challenges, we propose DMRL, a Data- and Model-aware Reward Learning approach for data extraction. This technique leverages inverse reinforcement learning to extract sensitive data from LLMs. Our method consists of two main components: (1) constructing an introspective reasoning dataset that captures leakage mindsets to guide model behavior, and (2) training reward models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), dynamically tuning optimization based on task difficulty at both the data and model levels. Comprehensive experiments across various LLMs demonstrate that DMRL outperforms all baseline methods in data extraction performance.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06284v1
DeFeed: Secure Decentralized Cross-Contract Data Feed in Web 3.0 for   Connected Autonomous Vehicles,"Smart contracts have been a topic of interest in blockchain research and are a key enabling technology for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in the era of Web 3.0. These contracts enable trustless interactions without the need for intermediaries, as they operate based on predefined rules encoded on the blockchain. However, smart contacts face significant challenges in cross-contract communication and information sharing, making it difficult to establish seamless connectivity and collaboration among CAVs with Web 3.0. In this paper, we propose DeFeed, a novel secure protocol that incorporates various gas-saving functions for CAVs, originated from in-depth research into the interaction among smart contracts for decentralized cross-contract data feed in Web 3.0. DeFeed allows smart contracts to obtain information from other contracts efficiently in a single click, without complicated operations. We judiciously design and complete various functions with DeFeed, including a pool function and a cache function for gas optimization, a subscribe function for facilitating data access, and an update function for the future iteration of our protocol. Tailored for CAVs with Web 3.0 use cases, DeFeed enables efficient data feed between smart contracts underpinning decentralized applications and vehicle coordination. Implemented and tested on the Ethereum official test network, DeFeed demonstrates significant improvements in contract interaction efficiency, reducing computational complexity and gas costs. Our solution represents a critical step towards seamless, decentralized communication in Web 3.0 ecosystems.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09928v2
Privacy-Preserving Runtime Verification,"Runtime verification offers scalable solutions to improve the safety and reliability of systems. However, systems that require verification or monitoring by a third party to ensure compliance with a specification might contain sensitive information, causing privacy concerns when usual runtime verification approaches are used. Privacy is compromised if protected information about the system, or sensitive data that is processed by the system, is revealed. In addition, revealing the specification being monitored may undermine the essence of third-party verification.   In this work, we propose two novel protocols for the privacy-preserving runtime verification of systems against formal sequential specifications. In our first protocol, the monitor verifies whether the system satisfies the specification without learning anything else, though both parties are aware of the specification. Our second protocol ensures that the system remains oblivious to the monitored specification, while the monitor learns only whether the system satisfies the specification and nothing more. Our protocols adapt and improve existing techniques used in cryptography, and more specifically, multi-party computation.   The sequential specification defines the observation step of the monitor, whose granularity depends on the situation (e.g., banks may be monitored on a daily basis). Our protocols exchange a single message per observation step, after an initialisation phase. This design minimises communication overhead, enabling relatively lightweight privacy-preserving monitoring. We implement our approach for monitoring specifications described by register automata and evaluate it experimentally.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09276v1
Robust Federated Learning with Confidence-Weighted Filtering and   GAN-Based Completion under Noisy and Incomplete Data,"Federated learning (FL) presents an effective solution for collaborative model training while maintaining data privacy across decentralized client datasets. However, data quality issues such as noisy labels, missing classes, and imbalanced distributions significantly challenge its effectiveness. This study proposes a federated learning methodology that systematically addresses data quality issues, including noise, class imbalance, and missing labels. The proposed approach systematically enhances data integrity through adaptive noise cleaning, collaborative conditional GAN-based synthetic data generation, and robust federated model training. Experimental evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets (MNIST and Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate significant improvements in federated model performance, particularly macro-F1 Score, under varying noise and class imbalance conditions. Additionally, the proposed framework carefully balances computational feasibility and substantial performance gains, ensuring practicality for resource constrained edge devices while rigorously maintaining data privacy. Our results indicate that this method effectively mitigates common data quality challenges, providing a robust, scalable, and privacy compliant solution suitable for diverse real-world federated learning scenarios.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09733v1
Attack and defense techniques in large language models: A survey and new   perspectives,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have become central to numerous natural language processing tasks, but their vulnerabilities present significant security and ethical challenges. This systematic survey explores the evolving landscape of attack and defense techniques in LLMs. We classify attacks into adversarial prompt attack, optimized attacks, model theft, as well as attacks on application of LLMs, detailing their mechanisms and implications. Consequently, we analyze defense strategies, including prevention-based and detection-based defense methods. Although advances have been made, challenges remain to adapt to the dynamic threat landscape, balance usability with robustness, and address resource constraints in defense implementation. We highlight open problems, including the need for adaptive scalable defenses, explainable security techniques, and standardized evaluation frameworks. This survey provides actionable insights and directions for developing secure and resilient LLMs, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical considerations to mitigate risks in real-world applications.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00976v1
Spill The Beans: Exploiting CPU Cache Side-Channels to Leak Tokens from   Large Language Models,"Side-channel attacks on shared hardware resources increasingly threaten confidentiality, especially with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce Spill The Beans, a novel application of cache side-channels to leak tokens generated by an LLM. By co-locating an attack process on the same hardware as the victim model, we flush and reload embedding vectors from the embedding layer, where each token corresponds to a unique embedding vector. When accessed during token generation, it results in a cache hit detectable by our attack on shared lower-level caches.   A significant challenge is the massive size of LLMs, which, by nature of their compute intensive operation, quickly evicts embedding vectors from the cache. We address this by balancing the number of tokens monitored against the amount of information leaked. Monitoring more tokens increases potential vocabulary leakage but raises the chance of missing cache hits due to eviction; monitoring fewer tokens improves detection reliability but limits vocabulary coverage.   Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the feasibility of leaking tokens from LLMs via cache side-channels. Our findings reveal a new vulnerability in LLM deployments, highlighting that even sophisticated models are susceptible to traditional side-channel attacks. We discuss the implications for privacy and security in LLM-serving infrastructures and suggest considerations for mitigating such threats. For proof of concept we consider two concrete attack scenarios: Our experiments show that an attacker can recover as much as 80%-90% of a high entropy API key with single shot monitoring. As for English text we can reach a 40% recovery rate with a single shot. We should note that the rate highly depends on the monitored token set and these rates can be improved by targeting more specialized output domains.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00817v1
Optimized Couplings for Watermarking Large Language Models,"Large-language models (LLMs) are now able to produce text that is, in many cases, seemingly indistinguishable from human-generated content. This has fueled the development of watermarks that imprint a ``signal'' in LLM-generated text with minimal perturbation of an LLM's output. This paper provides an analysis of text watermarking in a one-shot setting. Through the lens of hypothesis testing with side information, we formulate and analyze the fundamental trade-off between watermark detection power and distortion in generated textual quality. We argue that a key component in watermark design is generating a coupling between the side information shared with the watermark detector and a random partition of the LLM vocabulary. Our analysis identifies the optimal coupling and randomization strategy under the worst-case LLM next-token distribution that satisfies a min-entropy constraint. We provide a closed-form expression of the resulting detection rate under the proposed scheme and quantify the cost in a max-min sense. Finally, we provide an array of numerical results, comparing the proposed scheme with the theoretical optimum and existing schemes, in both synthetic data and LLM watermarking.

PQS-BFL: A Post-Quantum Secure Blockchain-based Federated Learning   Framework,"Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy, but its classical cryptographic underpinnings are vulnerable to quantum attacks. This vulnerability is particularly critical in sensitive domains like healthcare. This paper introduces PQS-BFL (Post-Quantum Secure Blockchain-based Federated Learning), a framework integrating post-quantum cryptography (PQC) with blockchain verification to secure FL against quantum adversaries. We employ ML-DSA-65 (a FIPS 204 standard candidate, formerly Dilithium) signatures to authenticate model updates and leverage optimized smart contracts for decentralized validation. Extensive evaluations on diverse datasets (MNIST, SVHN, HAR) demonstrate that PQS-BFL achieves efficient cryptographic operations (average PQC sign time: 0.65 ms, verify time: 0.53 ms) with a fixed signature size of 3309 Bytes. Blockchain integration incurs a manageable overhead, with average transaction times around 4.8 s and gas usage per update averaging 1.72 x 10^6 units for PQC configurations. Crucially, the cryptographic overhead relative to transaction time remains minimal (around 0.01-0.02% for PQC with blockchain), confirming that PQC performance is not the bottleneck in blockchain-based FL. The system maintains competitive model accuracy (e.g., over 98.8% for MNIST with PQC) and scales effectively, with round times showing sublinear growth with increasing client numbers. Our open-source implementation and reproducible benchmarks validate the feasibility of deploying long-term, quantum-resistant security in practical FL systems.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01866v1

Towards Trustworthy Federated Learning with Untrusted Participants,"Resilience against malicious parties and data privacy are essential for trustworthy distributed learning, yet achieving both with good utility typically requires the strong assumption of a trusted central server. This paper shows that a significantly weaker assumption suffices: each pair of workers shares a randomness seed unknown to others. In a setting where malicious workers may collude with an untrusted server, we propose CafCor, an algorithm that integrates robust gradient aggregation with correlated noise injection, leveraging shared randomness between workers. We prove that CafCor achieves strong privacy-utility trade-offs, significantly outperforming local differential privacy (DP) methods, which do not make any trust assumption, while approaching central DP utility, where the server is fully trusted. Empirical results on standard benchmarks validate CafCor's practicality, showing that privacy and robustness can coexist in distributed systems without sacrificing utility or trusting the server.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01874v1

S3C2 Summit 2024-09: Industry Secure Software Supply Chain Summit,"While providing economic and software development value, software supply chains are only as strong as their weakest link. Over the past several years, there has been an exponential increase in cyberattacks, specifically targeting vulnerable links in critical software supply chains. These attacks disrupt the day-to-day functioning and threaten the security of nearly everyone on the internet, from billion-dollar companies and government agencies to hobbyist open-source developers. The ever-evolving threat of software supply chain attacks has garnered interest from the software industry and the US government in improving software supply chain security.   On September 20, 2024, three researchers from the NSF-backed Secure Software Supply Chain Center (S3C2) conducted a Secure Software Supply Chain Summit with a diverse set of 12 practitioners from 9 companies. The goals of the Summit were to: (1) to enable sharing between individuals from different companies regarding practical experiences and challenges with software supply chain security, (2) to help form new collaborations, (3) to share our observations from our previous summits with industry, and (4) to learn about practitioners' challenges to inform our future research direction. The summit consisted of discussions of six topics relevant to the companies represented, including updating vulnerable dependencies, component and container choice, malicious commits, building infrastructure, large language models, and reducing entire classes of vulnerabilities.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10538v1
Probing the Vulnerability of Large Language Models to Polysemantic   Interventions,"Polysemanticity -- where individual neurons encode multiple unrelated features -- is a well-known characteristic of large neural networks and remains a central challenge in the interpretability of language models. At the same time, its implications for model safety are also poorly understood. Leveraging recent advances in sparse autoencoders, we investigate the polysemantic structure of two small models (Pythia-70M and GPT-2-Small) and evaluate their vulnerability to targeted, covert interventions at the prompt, feature, token, and neuron levels. Our analysis reveals a consistent polysemantic topology shared across both models. Strikingly, we demonstrate that this structure can be exploited to mount effective interventions on two larger, black-box instruction-tuned models (LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct). These findings suggest not only the generalizability of the interventions but also point to a stable and transferable polysemantic structure that could potentially persist across architectures and training regimes.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11611v1
SolPhishHunter: Towards Detecting and Understanding Phishing on Solana,"Solana is a rapidly evolving blockchain platform that has attracted an increasing number of users. However, this growth has also drawn the attention of malicious actors, with some phishers extending their reach into the Solana ecosystem. Unlike platforms such as Ethereum, Solana has distinct designs of accounts and transactions, leading to the emergence of new types of phishing transactions that we term SolPhish. We define three types of SolPhish and develop a detection tool called SolPhishHunter. Utilizing SolPhishHunter, we detect a total of 8,058 instances of SolPhish and conduct an empirical analysis of these detected cases. Our analysis explores the distribution and impact of SolPhish, the characteristics of the phishers, and the relationships among phishing gangs. Particularly, the detected SolPhish transactions have resulted in nearly \$1.1 million in losses for victims. We report our detection results to the community and construct SolPhishDataset, the \emph{first} Solana phishing-related dataset in academia.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04094v1
Benchmarking LLMs in an Embodied Environment for Blue Team Threat   Hlunting,"As cyber threats continue to grow in scale and sophistication, blue team defenders increasingly require advanced tools to proactively detect and mitigate risks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for enhancing threat analysis. However, their effectiveness in real-world blue team threat-hunting scenarios remains insufficiently explored. In this paper, we present CYBERTEAM, a benchmark designed to guide LLMs in blue teaming practice. CYBERTEAM constructs an embodied environment in two stages. First, it models realistic threat-hunting workflows by capturing the dependencies among analytical tasks from threat attribution to incident response. Next, each task is addressed through a set of embodied functions tailored to its specific analytical requirements. This transforms the overall threat-hunting process into a structured sequence of function-driven operations, where each node represents a discrete function and edges define the execution order. Guided by this framework, LLMs are directed to perform threat-hunting tasks through modular steps. Overall, CYBERTEAM integrates 30 tasks and 9 embodied functions, guiding LLMs through pipelined threat analysis. We evaluate leading LLMs and state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents, comparing CYBERTEAM's embodied function-calling against fundamental elicitation strategies.

Antifragility of RIS-assisted Communication Systems under Jamming   Attacks,"Antifragility of communication systems is defined as measure of benefits gained from the adverse events and variability of its environment. In this paper, we introduce the notion of antifragility in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) assisted communication systems affected by a jamming attack. We analyzed the antifragility of the two hop systems, where the wireless path contains source node, RIS, destination node, and a eavesdropping/jamming node. We propose and analyze the antifragility performance for several jamming models, such as Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) and phase and amplitude shifting. Our paper shows that antifragility throughput can indeed be achieved under certain power thresholds and for various jamming models. In particular, high jamming power combined with low baseline data rates yields an antifragile gain factor of approximately five times. The results confirm that reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, when coupled with an antifragile design philosophy, can convert hostile interference from a liability into a throughput gain.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02565v1
Proof-of-Social-Capital: Privacy-Preserving Consensus Protocol Replacing   Stake for Social Capital,"Consensus protocols used today in blockchains often rely on computational power or financial stakes - scarce resources. We propose a novel protocol using social capital - trust and influence from social interactions - as a non-transferable staking mechanism to ensure fairness and decentralization. The methodology integrates zero-knowledge proofs, verifiable credentials, a Whisk-like leader election, and an incentive scheme to prevent Sybil attacks and encourage engagement. The theoretical framework would enhance privacy and equity, though unresolved issues like off-chain bribery require further research. This work offers a new model aligned with modern social media behavior and lifestyle, with applications in finance, providing a practical insight for decentralized system development.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12144v1
"LLM Security: Vulnerabilities, Attacks, Defenses, and Countermeasures","As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, it is critical to assess the security threats and vulnerabilities that may arise both during their training phase and after models have been deployed. This survey seeks to define and categorize the various attacks targeting LLMs, distinguishing between those that occur during the training phase and those that affect already trained models. A thorough analysis of these attacks is presented, alongside an exploration of defense mechanisms designed to mitigate such threats. Defenses are classified into two primary categories: prevention-based and detection-based defenses. Furthermore, our survey summarizes possible attacks and their corresponding defense strategies. It also provides an evaluation of the effectiveness of the known defense mechanisms for the different security threats. Our survey aims to offer a structured framework for securing LLMs, while also identifying areas that require further research to improve and strengthen defenses against emerging security challenges.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01177v1
Browser Security Posture Analysis: A Client-Side Security Assessment   Framework,"Modern web browsers have effectively become the new operating system for business applications, yet their security posture is often under-scrutinized. This paper presents a novel, comprehensive Browser Security Posture Analysis Framework[1], a browser-based client-side security assessment toolkit that runs entirely in JavaScript and WebAssembly within the browser. It performs a battery of over 120 in-browser security tests in situ, providing fine-grained diagnostics of security policies and features that network-level or os-level tools cannot observe. This yields insights into how well a browser enforces critical client-side security invariants. We detail the motivation for such a framework, describe its architecture and implementation, and dive into the technical design of numerous test modules (covering the same-origin policy, cross-origin resource sharing, content security policy, sandboxing, XSS protection, extension interference via WeakRefs, permissions audits, garbage collection behavior, cryptographic APIs, SSL certificate validation, advanced web platform security features like SharedArrayBuffer, Content filtering controls ,and internal network accessibility). We then present an experimental evaluation across different browsers and enterprise scenarios, highlighting gaps in legacy browsers and common misconfigurations. Finally, we discuss the security and privacy implications of our findings, compare with related work in browser security and enterprise endpoint solutions, and outline future enhancements such as real-time posture monitoring and SIEM integration.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08050v1
The Tangent Space Attack,"We propose a new method for retrieving the algebraic structure of a generic alternant code given an arbitrary generator matrix, provided certain conditions are met. We then discuss how this challenges the security of the McEliece cryptosystem instantiated with this family of codes. The central object of our work is the quadratic hull related to a linear code, defined as the intersection of all quadrics passing through the columns of a given generator or parity-check matrix, where the columns are considered as points in the affine or projective space. The geometric properties of this object reveal important information about the internal algebraic structure of the code. This is particularly evident in the case of generalized Reed-Solomon codes, whose quadratic hull is deeply linked to a well-known algebraic variety called the rational normal curve. By utilizing the concept of Weil restriction of affine varieties, we demonstrate that the quadratic hull of a generic dual alternant code inherits many interesting features from the rational normal curve, on account of the fact that alternant codes are subfield-subcodes of generalized Reed-Solomon codes. If the rate of the generic alternant code is sufficiently high, this allows us to construct a polynomial-time algorithm for retrieving the underlying generalized Reed-Solomon code from which the alternant code is defined, which leads to an efficient key-recovery attack against the McEliece cryptosystem when instantiated with this class of codes. Finally, we discuss the generalization of this approach to Algebraic-Geometry codes and Goppa codes.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10184v1
Real-Time Bit-Level Encryption of Full High-Definition Video Without   Diffusion,"Despite the widespread adoption of Shannon's confusion-diffusion architecture in image encryption, the implementation of diffusion to sequentially establish inter-pixel dependencies for attaining plaintext sensitivity constrains algorithmic parallelism, while the execution of multiple rounds of diffusion operations to meet the required sensitivity metrics incurs excessive computational overhead. Consequently, the pursuit of plaintext sensitivity through diffusion operations is the primary factor limiting the computational efficiency and throughput of video encryption algorithms, rendering them inadequate to meet the demands of real-time encryption for high-resolution video. To address the performance limitation, this paper proposes a real-time video encryption protocol based on heterogeneous parallel computing, which incorporates the SHA-256 hashes of original frames as input, employs multiple CPU threads to concurrently generate encryption-related data, and deploys numerous GPU threads to simultaneously encrypt pixels. By leveraging the extreme input sensitivity of the SHA hash, the proposed protocol achieves the required plaintext sensitivity metrics with only a single round of confusion and XOR operations, significantly reducing computational overhead. Furthermore, through eliminating the reliance on diffusion, it realizes the allocation of a dedicated GPU thread for encrypting each pixel within every channel, effectively enhancing algorithm's parallelism. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only exhibits superior statistical properties and robust security but also achieving delay-free bit-level encryption for 1920$\times$1080 resolution (full high definition) video at 30 FPS, with an average encryption time of 25.84 ms on a server equipped with an Intel Xeon Gold 6226R CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07158v1
ThreatLens: LLM-guided Threat Modeling and Test Plan Generation for   Hardware Security Verification,"Current hardware security verification processes predominantly rely on manual threat modeling and test plan generation, which are labor-intensive, error-prone, and struggle to scale with increasing design complexity and evolving attack methodologies. To address these challenges, we propose ThreatLens, an LLM-driven multi-agent framework that automates security threat modeling and test plan generation for hardware security verification. ThreatLens integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to extract relevant security knowledge, LLM-powered reasoning for threat assessment, and interactive user feedback to ensure the generation of practical test plans. By automating these processes, the framework reduces the manual verification effort, enhances coverage, and ensures a structured, adaptable approach to security verification. We evaluated our framework on the NEORV32 SoC, demonstrating its capability to automate security verification through structured test plans and validating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06821v1
Inference Attacks for X-Vector Speaker Anonymization,"We revisit the privacy-utility tradeoff of x-vector speaker anonymization. Existing approaches quantify privacy through training complex speaker verification or identification models that are later used as attacks. Instead, we propose a novel inference attack for de-anonymization. Our attack is simple and ML-free yet we show experimentally that it outperforms existing approaches.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08978v1
Removing Watermarks with Partial Regeneration using Semantic Information,"As AI-generated imagery becomes ubiquitous, invisible watermarks have emerged as a primary line of defense for copyright and provenance. The newest watermarking schemes embed semantic signals - content-aware patterns that are designed to survive common image manipulations - yet their true robustness against adaptive adversaries remains under-explored. We expose a previously unreported vulnerability and introduce SemanticRegen, a three-stage, label-free attack that erases state-of-the-art semantic and invisible watermarks while leaving an image's apparent meaning intact. Our pipeline (i) uses a vision-language model to obtain fine-grained captions, (ii) extracts foreground masks with zero-shot segmentation, and (iii) inpaints only the background via an LLM-guided diffusion model, thereby preserving salient objects and style cues. Evaluated on 1,000 prompts across four watermarking systems - TreeRing, StegaStamp, StableSig, and DWT/DCT - SemanticRegen is the only method to defeat the semantic TreeRing watermark (p = 0.10 > 0.05) and reduces bit-accuracy below 0.75 for the remaining schemes, all while maintaining high perceptual quality (masked SSIM = 0.94 +/- 0.01). We further introduce masked SSIM (mSSIM) to quantify fidelity within foreground regions, showing that our attack achieves up to 12 percent higher mSSIM than prior diffusion-based attackers. These results highlight an urgent gap between current watermark defenses and the capabilities of adaptive, semantics-aware adversaries, underscoring the need for watermarking algorithms that are resilient to content-preserving regenerative attacks.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08234v1
Threat Modeling for AI: The Case for an Asset-Centric Approach,"Recent advances in AI are transforming AI's ubiquitous presence in our world from that of standalone AI-applications into deeply integrated AI-agents. These changes have been driven by agents' increasing capability to autonomously make decisions and initiate actions, using existing applications; whether those applications are AI-based or not. This evolution enables unprecedented levels of AI integration, with agents now able to take actions on behalf of systems and users -- including, in some cases, the powerful ability for the AI to write and execute scripts as it deems necessary. With AI systems now able to autonomously execute code, interact with external systems, and operate without human oversight, traditional security approaches fall short.   This paper introduces an asset-centric methodology for threat modeling AI systems that addresses the unique security challenges posed by integrated AI agents. Unlike existing top-down frameworks that analyze individual attacks within specific product contexts, our bottom-up approach enables defenders to systematically identify how vulnerabilities -- both conventional and AI-specific -- impact critical AI assets across distributed infrastructures used to develop and deploy these agents. This methodology allows security teams to: (1) perform comprehensive analysis that communicates effectively across technical domains, (2) quantify security assumptions about third-party AI components without requiring visibility into their implementation, and (3) holistically identify AI-based vulnerabilities relevant to their specific product context. This approach is particularly relevant for securing agentic systems with complex autonomous capabilities. By focusing on assets rather than attacks, our approach scales with the rapidly evolving threat landscape while accommodating increasingly complex and distributed AI development pipelines.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06315v1
LLMs' Suitability for Network Security: A Case Study of STRIDE Threat   Modeling,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to be an integral part of next-generation AI-native 6G networks. With the prevalence of AI, researchers have identified numerous use cases of AI in network security. However, there are almost nonexistent studies that analyze the suitability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in network security. To fill this gap, we examine the suitability of LLMs in network security, particularly with the case study of STRIDE threat modeling. We utilize four prompting techniques with five LLMs to perform STRIDE classification of 5G threats. From our evaluation results, we point out key findings and detailed insights along with the explanation of the possible underlying factors influencing the behavior of LLMs in the modeling of certain threats. The numerical results and the insights support the necessity for adjusting and fine-tuning LLMs for network security use cases.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04101v1
"Moneros Decentralized P2P Exchanges: Functionality, Adoption, and   Privacy Risks","Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero remain popular, despite increasing regulatory scrutiny that has led to their delisting from major centralized exchanges. The latter also explains the recent popularity of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with no centralized ownership structures. These platforms typically leverage peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, promising secure and anonymous asset trading. However, questions of liability remain, and the academic literature lacks comprehensive insights into the functionality, trading activity, and privacy claims of these P2P platforms. In this paper, we provide an early systematization of the current landscape of decentralized peer-to-peer exchanges within the Monero ecosystem. We examine several recently developed DEX platforms, analyzing their popularity, functionality, architectural choices, and potential weaknesses. We further identify and report on a privacy vulnerability in the recently popularized Haveno exchange, demonstrating that certain Haveno trades could be detected, allowing transactions to be linked across the Monero and Bitcoin blockchains. We hope that our findings can nourish the discussion in the research community about more secure designs, and provide insights for regulators.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02392v2
Security of Internet of Agents: Attacks and Countermeasures,"With the rise of large language and vision-language models, AI agents have evolved into autonomous, interactive systems capable of perception, reasoning, and decision-making. As they proliferate across virtual and physical domains, the Internet of Agents (IoA) has emerged as a key infrastructure for enabling scalable and secure coordination among heterogeneous agents. This survey offers a comprehensive examination of the security and privacy landscape in IoA systems. We begin by outlining the IoA architecture and its distinct vulnerabilities compared to traditional networks, focusing on four critical aspects: identity authentication threats, cross-agent trust issues, embodied security, and privacy risks. We then review existing and emerging defense mechanisms and highlight persistent challenges. Finally, we identify open research directions to advance the development of resilient and privacy-preserving IoA ecosystems.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08807v1
Auditing without Leaks Despite Curiosity,"\textit{Auditing} data accesses helps preserve privacy and ensures accountability by allowing one to determine who accessed (potentially sensitive) information. A prior formal definition of register auditability was based on the values returned by read operations, \emph{without accounting for cases where a reader might learn a value without explicitly reading it or gain knowledge of data access without being an auditor}.   This paper introduces a refined definition of auditability that focuses on when a read operation is \emph{effective}, rather than relying on its completion and return of a value. Furthermore, we formally specify the constraints that \textit{prevent readers from learning values they did not explicitly read or from auditing other readers' accesses.}   Our primary algorithmic contribution is a wait-free implementation of a \emph{multi-writer, multi-reader register} that tracks effective reads while preventing unauthorized audits. The key challenge is ensuring that a read is auditable as soon as it becomes effective, which we achieve by combining value access and access logging into a single atomic operation. Another challenge is recording accesses without exposing them to readers, which we address using a simple encryption technique (one-time pad).   We extend this implementation to an \emph{auditable max register} that tracks the largest value ever written. The implementation deals with the additional challenge posed by the max register semantics, which allows readers to learn prior values without reading them.   The max register, in turn, serves as the foundation for implementing an \emph{auditable snapshot} object and, more generally, \emph{versioned types}. These extensions maintain the strengthened notion of auditability, appropriately adapted from multi-writer, multi-reader registers.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00665v1
Network-wide Quantum Key Distribution with Onion Routing Relay   (Conference Version),"The advancement of quantum computing threatens classical cryptographic methods, necessitating the development of secure quantum key distribution (QKD) solutions for QKD Networks (QKDN). In this paper, a novel key distribution protocol, Onion Routing Relay (ORR), that integrates onion routing (OR) with post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in a key-relay (KR) model is evaluated for QKDNs. This approach increases the security by enhancing confidentiality, integrity, authenticity (CIA principles), and anonymity in quantum-secure communications. By employing PQC-based encapsulation, ORR aims to avoid the security risks posed by intermediate malicious nodes and ensures end-to-end security. Our results show a competitive performance of the basic ORR model, against current KR and trusted-node (TN) approaches, demonstrating its feasibility and applicability in high-security environments maintaining a consistent Quality of Service (QoS). The results also show that while basic ORR incurs higher encryption overhead, it provides substantial security improvements without significantly impacting the overall key distribution time. Nevertheless, the introduction of an end-to-end authentication extension (ORR-Ext) has a significant impact on the Quality of Service (QoS), thereby limiting its suitability to applications with stringent security requirements.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13158v1
Post-Quantum Secure Decentralized Random Number Generation Protocol with   Two Rounds of Communication in the Standard Model,"Randomness plays a vital role in numerous applications, including simulation, cryptography, distributed systems, and gaming. Consequently, extensive research has been conducted to generate randomness. One such method is to design a decentralized random number generator (DRNG), a protocol that enables multiple participants to collaboratively generate random outputs that must be publicly verifiable. However, existing DRNGs are either not secure against quantum computers or depend on the random oracle model (ROM) to achieve security. In this paper, we design a DRNG based on lattice-based publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) that is post-quantum secure and proven secure in the standard model. Additionally, our DRNG requires only two rounds of communication to generate a single (pseudo)random value and can tolerate up to any t < n/2 dishonest participants. To our knowledge, the proposed DRNG construction is the first to achieve all these properties.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07536v1
Self-Supervised Transformer-based Contrastive Learning for Intrusion   Detection Systems,"As the digital landscape becomes more interconnected, the frequency and severity of zero-day attacks, have significantly increased, leading to an urgent need for innovative Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Machine Learning-based IDS that learn from the network traffic characteristics and can discern attack patterns from benign traffic offer an advanced solution to traditional signature-based IDS. However, they heavily rely on labeled datasets, and their ability to generalize when encountering unseen traffic patterns remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel self-supervised contrastive learning approach based on transformer encoders, specifically tailored for generalizable intrusion detection on raw packet sequences. Our proposed learning scheme employs a packet-level data augmentation strategy combined with a transformer-based architecture to extract and generate meaningful representations of traffic flows. Unlike traditional methods reliant on handcrafted statistical features (NetFlow), our approach automatically learns comprehensive packet sequence representations, significantly enhancing performance in anomaly identification tasks and supervised learning for intrusion detection. Our transformer-based framework exhibits better performance in comparison to existing NetFlow self-supervised methods. Specifically, we achieve up to a 3% higher AUC in anomaly detection for intra-dataset evaluation and up to 20% higher AUC scores in inter-dataset evaluation. Moreover, our model provides a strong baseline for supervised intrusion detection with limited labeled data, exhibiting an improvement over self-supervised NetFlow models of up to 1.5% AUC when pretrained and evaluated on the same dataset. Additionally, we show the adaptability of our pretrained model when fine-tuned across different datasets, demonstrating strong performance even when lacking benign data from the target domain.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08816v1
A Framework to Prevent Biometric Data Leakage in the Immersive   Technologies Domain,"Doubtlessly, the immersive technologies have potential to ease people's life and uplift economy, however the obvious data privacy risks cannot be ignored. For example, a participant wears a 3D headset device which detects participant's head motion to track the pose of participant's head to match the orientation of camera with participant's eyes positions in the real-world. In a preliminary study, researchers have proved that the voice command features on such headsets could lead to major privacy leakages. By analyzing the facial dynamics captured with the motion sensors, the headsets suffer security vulnerabilities revealing a user's sensitive speech without user's consent. The psychography data (such as voice command features, facial dynamics, etc.) is sensitive data and it should not be leaked out of the device without users consent else it is a privacy breach. To the best of our literature review, the work done in this particular research problem is very limited. Motivated from this, we develop a simple technical framework to mitigate sensitive data (or biometric data) privacy leaks in immersive technology domain. The performance evaluation is conducted in a robust way using six data sets, to show that the proposed solution is effective and feasible to prevent this issue.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04123v1
AgentXploit: End-to-End Redteaming of Black-Box AI Agents,"The strong planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fostered the development of agent-based systems capable of leveraging external tools and interacting with increasingly complex environments. However, these powerful features also introduce a critical security risk: indirect prompt injection, a sophisticated attack vector that compromises the core of these agents, the LLM, by manipulating contextual information rather than direct user prompts. In this work, we propose a generic black-box fuzzing framework, AgentXploit, designed to automatically discover and exploit indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities across diverse LLM agents. Our approach starts by constructing a high-quality initial seed corpus, then employs a seed selection algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively refine inputs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of uncovering agent weaknesses. We evaluate AgentXploit on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo and VWA-adv, where it achieves 71% and 70% success rates against agents based on o3-mini and GPT-4o, respectively, nearly doubling the performance of baseline attacks. Moreover, AgentXploit exhibits strong transferability across unseen tasks and internal LLMs, as well as promising results against defenses. Beyond benchmark evaluations, we apply our attacks in real-world environments, successfully misleading agents to navigate to arbitrary URLs, including malicious sites.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05849v1
TechniqueRAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation for Adversarial Technique   Annotation in Cyber Threat Intelligence Text,"Accurately identifying adversarial techniques in security texts is critical for effective cyber defense. However, existing methods face a fundamental trade-off: they either rely on generic models with limited domain precision or require resource-intensive pipelines that depend on large labeled datasets and task-specific optimizations, such as custom hard-negative mining and denoising, resources rarely available in specialized domains.   We propose TechniqueRAG, a domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that bridges this gap by integrating off-the-shelf retrievers, instruction-tuned LLMs, and minimal text-technique pairs. Our approach addresses data scarcity by fine-tuning only the generation component on limited in-domain examples, circumventing the need for resource-intensive retrieval training. While conventional RAG mitigates hallucination by coupling retrieval and generation, its reliance on generic retrievers often introduces noisy candidates, limiting domain-specific precision. To address this, we enhance retrieval quality and domain specificity through zero-shot LLM re-ranking, which explicitly aligns retrieved candidates with adversarial techniques.   Experiments on multiple security benchmarks demonstrate that TechniqueRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance without extensive task-specific optimizations or labeled data, while comprehensive analysis provides further insights.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11988v1
Large Language Model-driven Security Assistant for Internet of Things   via Chain-of-Thought,"The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has transformed people's way of life and has a profound impact on both production and daily activities. However, with the rapid advancement of IoT technology, the security of IoT devices has become an unavoidable issue in both research and applications. Although some efforts have been made to detect or mitigate IoT security vulnerabilities, they often struggle to adapt to the complexity of IoT environments, especially when dealing with dynamic security scenarios. How to automatically, efficiently, and accurately understand these vulnerabilities remains a challenge. To address this, we propose an IoT security assistant driven by Large Language Model (LLM), which enhances the LLM's understanding of IoT security vulnerabilities and related threats. The aim of the ICoT method we propose is to enable the LLM to understand security issues by breaking down the various dimensions of security vulnerabilities and generating responses tailored to the user's specific needs and expertise level. By incorporating ICoT, LLM can gradually analyze and reason through complex security scenarios, resulting in more accurate, in-depth, and personalized security recommendations and solutions. Experimental results show that, compared to methods relying solely on LLM, our proposed LLM-driven IoT security assistant significantly improves the understanding of IoT security issues through the ICoT approach and provides personalized solutions based on the user's identity, demonstrating higher accuracy and reliability.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06307v1
Disassembly as Weighted Interval Scheduling with Learned Weights,"Disassembly is the first step of a variety of binary analysis and transformation techniques, such as reverse engineering, or binary rewriting. Recent disassembly approaches consist of three phases: an exploration phase, that overapproximates the binary's code; an analysis phase, that assigns weights to candidate instructions or basic blocks; and a conflict resolution phase, that downselects the final set of instructions. We present a disassembly algorithm that generalizes this pattern for a wide range of architectures, namely x86, x64, arm32, and aarch64. Our algorithm presents a novel conflict resolution method that reduces disassembly to weighted interval scheduling.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01536v1
Targeted Fuzzing for Unsafe Rust Code: Leveraging Selective   Instrumentation,"Rust is a promising programming language that focuses on concurrency, usability, and security. It is used in production code by major industry players and got recommended by government bodies. Rust provides strong security guarantees achieved by design utilizing the concepts of ownership and borrowing. However, Rust allows programmers to write unsafe code which is not subject to the strict Rust security policy. Empirical studies show that security issues in practice always involve code written in unsafe Rust.   In this paper, we present the first approach that utilizes selective code coverage feedback to focus the fuzzing efforts on unsafe Rust code. Our approach significantly improves the efficiency when fuzzing Rust programs and does not require additional computational resources while fuzz testing the target. To quantify the impact of partial code instrumentation, we implement our approach by extending the capabilities of the Rust compiler toolchain. We present an automated approach to detect unsafe and safe code components to decide which parts of the program a fuzzer should focus on when running a fuzzing campaign to find vulnerabilities in Rust programs. Our approach is fully compatible with existing fuzzing implementations and does not require complex manual work, thus retaining the existing high usability standard. Focusing on unsafe code, our implementation allows us to generate inputs that trigger more unsafe code locations with statistical significance and therefore is able to detect potential vulnerabilities in a shorter time span while imposing no performance overhead during fuzzing itself.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02464v1
RuleGenie: SIEM Detection Rule Set Optimization,"SIEM systems serve as a critical hub, employing rule-based logic to detect and respond to threats. Redundant or overlapping rules in SIEM systems lead to excessive false alerts, degrading analyst performance due to alert fatigue, and increase computational overhead and response latency for actual threats. As a result, optimizing SIEM rule sets is essential for efficient operations. Despite the importance of such optimization, research in this area is limited, with current practices relying on manual optimization methods that are both time-consuming and error-prone due to the scale and complexity of enterprise-level rule sets. To address this gap, we present RuleGenie, a novel large language model (LLM) aided recommender system designed to optimize SIEM rule sets. Our approach leverages transformer models' multi-head attention capabilities to generate SIEM rule embeddings, which are then analyzed using a similarity matching algorithm to identify the top-k most similar rules. The LLM then processes the rules identified, utilizing its information extraction, language understanding, and reasoning capabilities to analyze rule similarity, evaluate threat coverage and performance metrics, and deliver optimized recommendations for refining the rule set. By automating the rule optimization process, RuleGenie allows security teams to focus on more strategic tasks while enhancing the efficiency of SIEM systems and strengthening organizations' security posture. We evaluated RuleGenie on a comprehensive set of real-world SIEM rule formats, including Splunk, Sigma, and AQL (Ariel query language), demonstrating its platform-agnostic capabilities and adaptability across diverse security infrastructures. Our experimental results show that RuleGenie can effectively identify redundant rules, which in turn decreases false positive rates and enhances overall rule efficiency.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06701v1
A Weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerance Consensus Driven Trusted Multiple   Large Language Models Network,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications. However, individual LLMs often produce inconsistent, biased, or hallucinated outputs due to limitations in their training corpora and model architectures. Recently, collaborative frameworks such as the Multi-LLM Network (MultiLLMN) have been introduced, enabling multiple LLMs to interact and jointly respond to user queries. Nevertheless, MultiLLMN architectures raise critical concerns regarding the reliability and security of the generated content, particularly in open environments where malicious or compromised LLMs may be present. Moreover, reliance on centralized coordination undermines system efficiency and introduces single points of failure. In this paper, we propose a novel Trusted MultiLLMN framework, driven by a Weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerance (WBFT) blockchain consensus mechanism, to ensure the reliability, security, and efficiency of multi-LLM collaboration. In WBFT, voting weights are adaptively assigned to each LLM based on its response quality and trustworthiness, incentivizing reliable behavior, and reducing the impact of malicious nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that WBFT significantly improves both consensus security and efficiency compared to classical and modern consensus mechanisms, particularly under wireless network conditions. Furthermore, our evaluations reveal that Trusted MultiLLMN supported by WBFT can deliver higher-quality and more credible responses than both single LLMs and conventional MultiLLMNs, thereby providing a promising path toward building robust, decentralized AI collaboration networks.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05103v1
Privacy-Preserving Transformers: SwiftKey's Differential Privacy   Implementation,"In this paper we train a transformer using differential privacy (DP) for language modeling in SwiftKey. We run multiple experiments to balance the trade-off between the model size, run-time speed and accuracy. We show that we get small and consistent gains in the next-word-prediction and accuracy with graceful increase in memory and speed compared to the production GRU. This is obtained by scaling down a GPT2 architecture to fit the required size and a two stage training process that builds a seed model on general data and DP finetunes it on typing data. The transformer is integrated using ONNX offering both flexibility and efficiency.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05648v1
Crowding Out The Noise: Algorithmic Collective Action Under Differential   Privacy,"The integration of AI into daily life has generated considerable attention and excitement, while also raising concerns about automating algorithmic harms and re-entrenching existing social inequities. While the responsible deployment of trustworthy AI systems is a worthy goal, there are many possible ways to realize it, from policy and regulation to improved algorithm design and evaluation. In fact, since AI trains on social data, there is even a possibility for everyday users, citizens, or workers to directly steer its behavior through Algorithmic Collective Action, by deliberately modifying the data they share with a platform to drive its learning process in their favor. This paper considers how these grassroots efforts to influence AI interact with methods already used by AI firms and governments to improve model trustworthiness. In particular, we focus on the setting where the AI firm deploys a differentially private model, motivated by the growing regulatory focus on privacy and data protection. We investigate how the use of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) affects the collective's ability to influence the learning process. Our findings show that while differential privacy contributes to the protection of individual data, it introduces challenges for effective algorithmic collective action. We characterize lower bounds on the success of algorithmic collective action under differential privacy as a function of the collective's size and the firm's privacy parameters, and verify these trends experimentally by simulating collective action during the training of deep neural network classifiers across several datasets.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05707v1
Measuring Security in 5G and Future Networks,"In today's increasingly interconnected and fast-paced digital ecosystem, mobile networks, such as 5G and future generations such as 6G, play a pivotal role and must be considered as critical infrastructures. Ensuring their security is paramount to safeguard both individual users and the industries that depend on these networks. An essential condition for maintaining and improving the security posture of a system is the ability to effectively measure and monitor its security state. In this work we address the need for an objective measurement of the security state of 5G and future networks. We introduce a state machine model designed to capture the security life cycle of network functions and the transitions between different states within the life cycle. Such a model can be computed locally at each node, or hierarchically, by aggregating measurements into security domains or the whole network. We identify three essential security metrics -- attack surface exposure, impact of system vulnerabilities, and effectiveness of applied security controls -- that collectively form the basis for calculating the overall security score. With this approach, it is possible to provide a holistic understanding of the security posture, laying the foundation for effective security management in the expected dynamic threat landscape of 6G networks. Through practical examples, we illustrate the real-world application of our proposed methodology, offering valuable insights for developing risk management and informed decision-making strategies in 5G and 6G security operations and laying the foundation for effective security management in the expected dynamic threat landscape of 6G networks.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08799v1
Exploring the Susceptibility to Fraud of Monetary Incentive Mechanisms   for Strengthening FOSS Projects,"Free and open source software (FOSS) is ubiquitous on modern IT systems, accelerating the speed of software engineering over the past decades. With its increasing importance and historical reliance on uncompensated contributions, questions have been raised regarding the continuous maintenance of FOSS and its implications from a security perspective. In recent years, different funding programs have emerged to provide external incentives to reinforce community FOSS' sustainability. Past research primarily focused on analyses what type of projects have been funded and for what reasons. However, it has neither been considered whether there is a need for such external incentives, nor whether the incentive mechanisms, especially with the development of decentralized approaches, are susceptible to fraud. In this study, we explore the need for funding through a literature review and compare the susceptibility to fraud of centralized and decentralized incentive programs by performing case studies on the Sovereign Tech Fund (STF) and the tea project. We find non-commercial incentives to fill an important gap, ensuring longevity and sustainability of projects. Furthermore, we find the STF to be able to achieve a high resilience against fraud attempts, while tea is highly susceptible to fraud, as evidenced by revelation of an associated sybil attack on npm. Our results imply that special considerations must be taken into account when utilizing quantitative repository metrics regardless whether spoofing is expected.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05897v1
A Survey on Privacy Risks and Protection in Large Language Models,"Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly integral to diverse applications, their capabilities raise significant privacy concerns. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of privacy risks associated with LLMs and examines current solutions to mitigate these challenges. First, we analyze privacy leakage and attacks in LLMs, focusing on how these models unintentionally expose sensitive information through techniques such as model inversion, training data extraction, and membership inference. We investigate the mechanisms of privacy leakage, including the unauthorized extraction of training data and the potential exploitation of these vulnerabilities by malicious actors. Next, we review existing privacy protection against such risks, such as inference detection, federated learning, backdoor mitigation, and confidential computing, and assess their effectiveness in preventing privacy leakage. Furthermore, we highlight key practical challenges and propose future research directions to develop secure and privacy-preserving LLMs, emphasizing privacy risk assessment, secure knowledge transfer between models, and interdisciplinary frameworks for privacy governance. Ultimately, this survey aims to establish a roadmap for addressing escalating privacy challenges in the LLMs domain.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01976v1
Practical Reasoning Interruption Attacks on Reasoning Large Language   Models,"Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across a variety of tasks, yet they also expose numerous security vulnerabilities. Most of these vulnerabilities have centered on the generation of unsafe content. However, recent work has identified a distinct ""thinking-stopped"" vulnerability in DeepSeek-R1: under adversarial prompts, the model's reasoning process ceases at the system level and produces an empty final answer. Building upon this vulnerability, researchers developed a novel prompt injection attack, termed reasoning interruption attack, and also offered an initial analysis of its root cause. Through extensive experiments, we verify the previous analyses, correct key errors based on three experimental findings, and present a more rigorous explanation of the fundamental causes driving the vulnerability. Moreover, existing attacks typically require over 2,000 tokens, impose significant overhead, reduce practicality, and are easily detected. To overcome these limitations, we propose the first practical reasoning interruption attack. It succeeds with just 109 tokens by exploiting our newly uncovered ""reasoning token overflow"" (RTO) effect to overwrite the model's final answer, forcing it to return an invalid response. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed attack is highly effective. Furthermore, we discover that the method for triggering RTO differs between the official DeepSeek-R1 release and common unofficial deployments. As a broadened application of RTO, we also construct a novel jailbreak attack that enables the transfer of unsafe content within the reasoning tokens into final answer, thereby exposing it to the user. Our work carries significant implications for enhancing the security of RLLMs.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06643v1
GuardReasoner-VL: Safeguarding VLMs via Reinforced Reasoning,"To enhance the safety of VLMs, this paper introduces a novel reasoning-based VLM guard model dubbed GuardReasoner-VL. The core idea is to incentivize the guard model to deliberatively reason before making moderation decisions via online RL. First, we construct GuardReasoner-VLTrain, a reasoning corpus with 123K samples and 631K reasoning steps, spanning text, image, and text-image inputs. Then, based on it, we cold-start our model's reasoning ability via SFT. In addition, we further enhance reasoning regarding moderation through online RL. Concretely, to enhance diversity and difficulty of samples, we conduct rejection sampling followed by data augmentation via the proposed safety-aware data concatenation. Besides, we use a dynamic clipping parameter to encourage exploration in early stages and exploitation in later stages. To balance performance and token efficiency, we design a length-aware safety reward that integrates accuracy, format, and token cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model. Remarkably, it surpasses the runner-up by 19.27% F1 score on average. We release data, code, and models (3B/7B) of GuardReasoner-VL at https://github.com/yueliu1999/GuardReasoner-VL/",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11049v1
LiteLMGuard: Seamless and Lightweight On-Device Prompt Filtering for   Safeguarding Small Language Models against Quantization-induced Risks and   Vulnerabilities,"The growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has influenced the development of their lighter counterparts-Small Language Models (SLMs)-to enable on-device deployment across smartphones and edge devices. These SLMs offer enhanced privacy, reduced latency, server-free functionality, and improved user experience. However, due to resource constraints of on-device environment, SLMs undergo size optimization through compression techniques like quantization, which can inadvertently introduce fairness, ethical and privacy risks. Critically, quantized SLMs may respond to harmful queries directly, without requiring adversarial manipulation, raising significant safety and trust concerns.   To address this, we propose LiteLMGuard (LLMG), an on-device prompt guard that provides real-time, prompt-level defense for quantized SLMs. Additionally, our prompt guard is designed to be model-agnostic such that it can be seamlessly integrated with any SLM, operating independently of underlying architectures. Our LLMG formalizes prompt filtering as a deep learning (DL)-based prompt answerability classification task, leveraging semantic understanding to determine whether a query should be answered by any SLM. Using our curated dataset, Answerable-or-Not, we trained and fine-tuned several DL models and selected ELECTRA as the candidate, with 97.75% answerability classification accuracy.   Our safety effectiveness evaluations demonstrate that LLMG defends against over 87% of harmful prompts, including both direct instruction and jailbreak attack strategies. We further showcase its ability to mitigate the Open Knowledge Attacks, where compromised SLMs provide unsafe responses without adversarial prompting. In terms of prompt filtering effectiveness, LLMG achieves near state-of-the-art filtering accuracy of 94%, with an average latency of 135 ms, incurring negligible overhead for users.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05619v2
AI-Driven IRM: Transforming insider risk management with adaptive   scoring and LLM-based threat detection,"Insider threats pose a significant challenge to organizational security, often evading traditional rule-based detection systems due to their subtlety and contextual nature. This paper presents an AI-powered Insider Risk Management (IRM) system that integrates behavioral analytics, dynamic risk scoring, and real-time policy enforcement to detect and mitigate insider threats with high accuracy and adaptability. We introduce a hybrid scoring mechanism - transitioning from the static PRISM model to an adaptive AI-based model utilizing an autoencoder neural network trained on expert-annotated user activity data. Through iterative feedback loops and continuous learning, the system reduces false positives by 59% and improves true positive detection rates by 30%, demonstrating substantial gains in detection precision. Additionally, the platform scales efficiently, processing up to 10 million log events daily with sub-300ms query latency, and supports automated enforcement actions for policy violations, reducing manual intervention. The IRM system's deployment resulted in a 47% reduction in incident response times, highlighting its operational impact. Future enhancements include integrating explainable AI, federated learning, graph-based anomaly detection, and alignment with Zero Trust principles to further elevate its adaptability, transparency, and compliance-readiness. This work establishes a scalable and proactive framework for mitigating emerging insider risks in both on-premises and hybrid environments.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03796v1
Area Comparison of CHERIoT and PMP in Ibex,"Memory safety is a critical concern for modern embedded systems, particularly in security-sensitive applications. This paper explores the area impact of adding memory safety extensions to the Ibex RISC-V core, focusing on physical memory protection (PMP) and Capability Hardware Extension to RISC-V for Internet of Things (CHERIoT). We synthesise the extended Ibex cores using a commercial tool targeting the open FreePDK45 process and provide a detailed area breakdown and discussion of the results.   The PMP configuration we consider is one with 16 PMP regions. We find that the extensions increase the core size by 24 thousand gate-equivalent (kGE) for PMP and 33 kGE for CHERIoT. The increase is mainly due to the additional state required to store information about protected memory. While this increase amounts to 42% for PMP and 57% for CHERIoT in Ibex's area, its effect on the overall system is minimal. In a complete system-on-chip (SoC), like the secure microcontroller OpenTitan Earl Grey, where the core represents only a fraction of the total area, the estimated system-wide overhead is 0.6% for PMP and 1% for CHERIoT. Given the security benefits these extensions provide, the area trade-off is justified, making Ibex a compelling choice for secure embedded applications.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08541v1
SoK: A Taxonomy for Distributed-Ledger-Based Identity Management,"The intersection of blockchain (distributed ledger) and identity management lacks a comprehensive framework for classifying distributed-ledger-based identity solutions. This paper introduces a methodologically developed taxonomy derived from the analysis of 390 scientific papers and expert discussions.   The resulting framework consists of 22 dimensions with 113 characteristics, organized into three groups: trust anchor implementations, identity architectures (identifiers and credentials), and ledger specifications. This taxonomy facilitates the systematic analysis, comparison, and design of distributed-ledger-based identity solutions, as demonstrated through its application to two distinct architectures.   As the first methodology-driven taxonomy in this field, this work advances standardization and enhances understanding of distributed-ledger-based identity architectures. It provides researchers and practitioners with a structured framework for evaluating design decisions and implementation approaches.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05100v1
Applied Post Quantum Cryptography: A Practical Approach for Generating   Certificates in Industrial Environments,"The transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) presents significant challenges for certificate-based identity management in industrial environments, where secure onboarding of devices relies on long-lived and interoperable credentials. This work analyzes the integration of PQC into X.509 certificate structures and compares existing tool support for classical, hybrid, composite, and chameleon certificates. A gap is identified in available open-source solutions, particularly for the generation and validation of hybrid and composite certificates via command-line interfaces. To address this, a proof-of-concept implementation based on the Bouncy Castle library is developed. The tool supports the creation of classical, hybrid (Catalyst), composite, and partially chameleon certificates using PQC algorithms such as ML-DSA and SLH-DSA. It demonstrates compatibility with standard X.509 workflows and aims to support headless operation and constrained platforms typical of industrial systems. The implementation is modular, publicly available, and intended to facilitate further research and testing of PQC migration strategies in practice. A comparison with OpenSSL-based solutions highlights current limitations in standardization, toolchain support, and algorithm coverage.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04333v1
Graph-Based Floor Separation Using Node Embeddings and Clustering of   WiFi Trajectories,"Indoor positioning systems (IPSs) are increasingly vital for location-based services in complex multi-storey environments. This study proposes a novel graph-based approach for floor separation using Wi-Fi fingerprint trajectories, addressing the challenge of vertical localization in indoor settings. We construct a graph where nodes represent Wi-Fi fingerprints, and edges are weighted by signal similarity and contextual transitions. Node2Vec is employed to generate low-dimensional embeddings, which are subsequently clustered using K-means to identify distinct floors. Evaluated on the Huawei University Challenge 2021 dataset, our method outperforms traditional community detection algorithms, achieving an accuracy of 68.97%, an F1- score of 61.99%, and an Adjusted Rand Index of 57.19%. By publicly releasing the preprocessed dataset and implementation code, this work contributes to advancing research in indoor positioning. The proposed approach demonstrates robustness to signal noise and architectural complexities, offering a scalable solution for floor-level localization.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08088v1
Machine Learning for Cyber-Attack Identification from Traffic Flows,"This paper presents our simulation of cyber-attacks and detection strategies on the traffic control system in Daytona Beach, FL. using Raspberry Pi virtual machines and the OPNSense firewall, along with traffic dynamics from SUMO and exploitation via the Metasploit framework. We try to answer the research questions: are we able to identify cyber attacks by only analyzing traffic flow patterns. In this research, the cyber attacks are focused particularly when lights are randomly turned all green or red at busy intersections by adversarial attackers. Despite challenges stemming from imbalanced data and overlapping traffic patterns, our best model shows 85\% accuracy when detecting intrusions purely using traffic flow statistics. Key indicators for successful detection included occupancy, jam length, and halting durations.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01489v1
Self-Supervised Federated GNSS Spoofing Detection with Opportunistic   Data,"Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are vulnerable to spoofing attacks, with adversarial signals manipulating the location or time information of receivers, potentially causing severe disruptions. The task of discerning the spoofing signals from benign ones is naturally relevant for machine learning, thus recent interest in applying it for detection. While deep learning-based methods are promising, they require extensive labeled datasets, consume significant computational resources, and raise privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of position data. This is why this paper proposes a self-supervised federated learning framework for GNSS spoofing detection. It consists of a cloud server and local mobile platforms. Each mobile platform employs a self-supervised anomaly detector using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Labels for training are generated locally through a spoofing-deviation prediction algorithm, ensuring privacy. Local models are trained independently, and only their parameters are uploaded to the cloud server, which aggregates them into a global model using FedAvg. The updated global model is then distributed back to the mobile platforms and trained iteratively. The evaluation shows that our self-supervised federated learning framework outperforms position-based and deep learning-based methods in detecting spoofing attacks while preserving data privacy.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06171v1
System Prompt Poisoning: Persistent Attacks on Large Language Models   Beyond User Injection,"Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption across diverse applications due to their impressive generative capabilities. Their plug-and-play nature enables both developers and end users to interact with these models through simple prompts. However, as LLMs become more integrated into various systems in diverse domains, concerns around their security are growing. Existing studies mainly focus on threats arising from user prompts (e.g. prompt injection attack) and model output (e.g. model inversion attack), while the security of system prompts remains largely overlooked. This work bridges the critical gap. We introduce system prompt poisoning, a new attack vector against LLMs that, unlike traditional user prompt injection, poisons system prompts hence persistently impacts all subsequent user interactions and model responses. We systematically investigate four practical attack strategies in various poisoning scenarios. Through demonstration on both generative and reasoning LLMs, we show that system prompt poisoning is highly feasible without requiring jailbreak techniques, and effective across a wide range of tasks, including those in mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, and natural language processing. Importantly, our findings reveal that the attack remains effective even when user prompts employ advanced prompting techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT). We also show that such techniques, including CoT and retrieval-augmentation-generation (RAG), which are proven to be effective for improving LLM performance in a wide range of tasks, are significantly weakened in their effectiveness by system prompt poisoning.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06493v1
I Know What You Said: Unveiling Hardware Cache Side-Channels in Local   Large Language Model Inference,"Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be deployed locally have recently gained popularity for privacy-sensitive tasks, with companies such as Meta, Google, and Intel playing significant roles in their development. However, the security of local LLMs through the lens of hardware cache side-channels remains unexplored. In this paper, we unveil novel side-channel vulnerabilities in local LLM inference: token value and token position leakage, which can expose both the victim's input and output text, thereby compromising user privacy. Specifically, we found that adversaries can infer the token values from the cache access patterns of the token embedding operation, and deduce the token positions from the timing of autoregressive decoding phases. To demonstrate the potential of these leaks, we design a novel eavesdropping attack framework targeting both open-source and proprietary LLM inference systems. The attack framework does not directly interact with the victim's LLM and can be executed without privilege.   We evaluate the attack on a range of practical local LLM deployments (e.g., Llama, Falcon, and Gemma), and the results show that our attack achieves promising accuracy. The restored output and input text have an average edit distance of 5.2% and 17.3% to the ground truth, respectively. Furthermore, the reconstructed texts achieve average cosine similarity scores of 98.7% (input) and 98.0% (output).",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06738v2
Machine Learning-Based Detection of DDoS Attacks in VANETs for Emergency   Vehicle Communication,"Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) play a key role in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), particularly in enabling real-time communication for emergency vehicles. However, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which interfere with safety-critical communication channels, can severely impair their reliability. This study introduces a robust and scalable framework to detect DDoS attacks in highway-based VANET environments. A synthetic dataset was constructed using Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) in conjunction with the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) and further enriched with real-world mobility traces from Germany's A81 highway, extracted via OpenStreetMap (OSM). Three traffic categories were simulated: DDoS, VoIP, and TCP-based video streaming (VideoTCP). The data preprocessing pipeline included normalization, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) feature engineering, missing value imputation, and class balancing using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Feature importance was assessed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Eleven classifiers were benchmarked, among them XGBoost (XGB), CatBoost (CB), AdaBoost (AB), GradientBoosting (GB), and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). XGB and CB achieved the best performance, each attaining an F1-score of 96%. These results highlight the robustness of the proposed framework and its potential for real-time deployment in VANETs to secure critical emergency communications.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08810v1
RAN Tester UE: An Automated Declarative UE Centric Security Testing   Platform,"Cellular networks require strict security procedures and measures across various network components, from core to radio access network (RAN) and end-user devices. As networks become increasingly complex and interconnected, as in O-RAN deployments, they are exposed to a numerous security threats. Therefore, ensuring robust security is critical for O-RAN to protect network integrity and safeguard user data. This requires rigorous testing methodologies to mitigate threats. This paper introduces an automated, adaptive, and scalable user equipment (UE) based RAN security testing framework designed to address the shortcomings of existing RAN testing solutions. Experimental results on a 5G software radio testbed built with commercial off-the-shelf hardware and open source software validate the efficiency and reproducibility of sample security test procedures developed on the RAN Tester UE framework.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10812v1
Efficient Implementations of Residue Generators Mod 2n + 1 Providing   Diminished-1 Representation,"The moduli of the form 2n + 1 belong to a class of low-cost odd moduli, which have been frequently selected to form the basis of various residue number systems (RNS). The most efficient computations modulo (mod) 2n + 1 are performed using the so-called diminished-1 (D1) representation. Therefore, it is desirable that the input converter from the positional number system to RNS (composed of a set of residue generators) could generate the residues mod 2n + 1 in D1 form. In this paper, we propose the basic architecture of the residue generator mod 2n + 1 with D1 output. It is universal, because its initial part can be easily designed for an arbitrary p >= 4n, whereas its final block-the 4-operand adder mod 2n + 1-preserves the same structure for any p. If a pair of conjugate moduli 2n +/- 1 belongs to the RNS moduli set, the latter architecture can be easily extended to build p-input bi-residue generators mod 2n+/-1, which not only save hardware by sharing p - 4n full-adders, but also generate the residue mod 2n + 1 directly in D1 form.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11928v1
Random Client Selection on Contrastive Federated Learning for Tabular   Data,"Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has revolutionised collaborative machine learning by enabling privacy-preserving model training across multiple parties. However, it remains vulnerable to information leakage during intermediate computation sharing. While Contrastive Federated Learning (CFL) was introduced to mitigate these privacy concerns through representation learning, it still faces challenges from gradient-based attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive experimental analysis of gradient-based attacks in CFL environments and evaluates random client selection as a defensive strategy. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that random client selection proves particularly effective in defending against gradient attacks in the CFL network. Our findings provide valuable insights for implementing robust security measures in contrastive federated learning systems, contributing to the development of more secure collaborative learning frameworks",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10759v1
ProxyPrompt: Securing System Prompts against Prompt Extraction Attacks,"The integration of large language models (LLMs) into a wide range of applications has highlighted the critical role of well-crafted system prompts, which require extensive testing and domain expertise. These prompts enhance task performance but may also encode sensitive information and filtering criteria, posing security risks if exposed. Recent research shows that system prompts are vulnerable to extraction attacks, while existing defenses are either easily bypassed or require constant updates to address new threats. In this work, we introduce ProxyPrompt, a novel defense mechanism that prevents prompt leakage by replacing the original prompt with a proxy. This proxy maintains the original task's utility while obfuscating the extracted prompt, ensuring attackers cannot reproduce the task or access sensitive information. Comprehensive evaluations on 264 LLM and system prompt pairs show that ProxyPrompt protects 94.70% of prompts from extraction attacks, outperforming the next-best defense, which only achieves 42.80%.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11459v1
The Ephemeral Threat: Assessing the Security of Algorithmic Trading   Systems powered by Deep Learning,"We study the security of stock price forecasting using Deep Learning (DL) in computational finance. Despite abundant prior research on the vulnerability of DL to adversarial perturbations, such work has hitherto hardly addressed practical adversarial threat models in the context of DL-powered algorithmic trading systems (ATS). Specifically, we investigate the vulnerability of ATS to adversarial perturbations launched by a realistically constrained attacker. We first show that existing literature has paid limited attention to DL security in the financial domain, which is naturally attractive for adversaries. Then, we formalize the concept of ephemeral perturbations (EP), which can be used to stage a novel type of attack tailored for DL-based ATS. Finally, we carry out an end-to-end evaluation of our EP against a profitable ATS. Our results reveal that the introduction of small changes to the input stock prices not only (i) induces the DL model to behave incorrectly but also (ii) leads the whole ATS to make suboptimal buy/sell decisions, resulting in a worse financial performance of the targeted ATS.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10430v1
Evaluating Explanation Quality in X-IDS Using Feature Alignment Metrics,"Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have become increasingly important in the context of explainable intrusion detection systems (X-IDSs) for improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of X-IDSs. However, existing evaluation approaches for XAI focus on model-specific properties such as fidelity and simplicity, and neglect whether the explanation content is meaningful or useful within the application domain. In this paper, we introduce new evaluation metrics measuring the quality of explanations from X-IDSs. The metrics aim at quantifying how well explanations are aligned with predefined feature sets that can be identified from domain-specific knowledge bases. Such alignment with these knowledge bases enables explanations to reflect domain knowledge and enables meaningful and actionable insights for security analysts. In our evaluation, we demonstrate the use of the proposed metrics to evaluate the quality of explanations from X-IDSs. The experimental results show that the proposed metrics can offer meaningful differences in explanation quality across X-IDSs and attack types, and assess how well X-IDS explanations reflect known domain knowledge. The findings of the proposed metrics provide actionable insights for security analysts to improve the interpretability of X-IDS in practical settings.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08006v1
Agent Name Service (ANS): A Universal Directory for Secure AI Agent   Discovery and Interoperability,"The proliferation of AI agents requires robust mechanisms for secure discovery.

Protocol as Poetry: Case Study on Pak's Protocol Arts,"Protocol art emerges at the confluence of blockchain-based smart contracts and a century-long lineage of conceptual art, participatory art, and algorithmic generative art practices. Yet existing definitions-most notably Primavera De Filippi's ""protocolism""-struggle to demarcate this nascent genre from other art forms in practice. Addressing this definition-to-practice gap, this paper offers a focused case study of pioneering protocol artworks by Pak, an early and influential pseudonymous protocol artist who treats smart contracts as medium and protocol participation as message. Tracing the evolution from early open-edition releases of The Fungible and the dynamic mechanics of Merge to the soul-bound messaging of Censored and the reflective absence of Not Found, we examine how Pak choreographs distributed agency across collectors and autonomous contracts, showing how programmable protocols become a social fabric in artistic meaning-making. Through thematic analysis of Pak's works, we identify seven core characteristics that distinguish protocol art: (1) system-centric rather than object-centric composition, (2) autonomous governance for open-ended control, (3) distributed agency and communal authorship, (4) temporal dynamism and lifecycle aesthetics, (5) economic-driven engagement, (6) poetic message embedding in interaction rituals, and (7) interoperability enabling composability for emergence. We then discuss how these features set protocol art apart from adjacent artistic movements. By developing a theoretical framework grounded in Pak's practice, we contribute to the emerging literature on protocolism while offering design implications for artists shaping this evolving art form.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12393v1
Privacy-aware Berrut Approximated Coded Computing applied to general   distributed learning,"Coded computing is one of the techniques that can be used for privacy protection in Federated Learning. However, most of the constructions used for coded computing work only under the assumption that the computations involved are exact, generally restricted to special classes of functions, and require quantized inputs. This paper considers the use of Private Berrut Approximate Coded Computing (PBACC) as a general solution to add strong but non-perfect privacy to federated learning. We derive new adapted PBACC algorithms for centralized aggregation, secure distributed training with centralized data, and secure decentralized training with decentralized data, thus enlarging significantly the applications of the method and the existing privacy protection tools available for these paradigms. Particularly, PBACC can be used robustly to attain privacy guarantees in decentralized federated learning for a variety of models. Our numerical results show that the achievable quality of different learning models (convolutional neural networks, variational autoencoders, and Cox regression) is minimally altered by using these new computing schemes, and that the privacy leakage can be bounded strictly to less than a fraction of one bit per participant. Additionally, the computational cost of the encoding and decoding processes depends only of the degree of decentralization of the data.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06759v1
Automating Security Audit Using Large Language Model based Agent: An   Exploration Experiment,"In the current rapidly changing digital environment, businesses are under constant stress to ensure that their systems are secured. Security audits help to maintain a strong security posture by ensuring that policies are in place, controls are implemented, gaps are identified for cybersecurity risks mitigation. However, audits are usually manual, requiring much time and costs. This paper looks at the possibility of developing a framework to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as an autonomous agent to execute part of the security audit, namely with the field audit. password policy compliance for Windows operating system. Through the conduct of an exploration experiment of using GPT-4 with Langchain, the agent executed the audit tasks by accurately flagging password policy violations and appeared to be more efficient than traditional manual audits. Despite its potential limitations in operational consistency in complex and dynamic environment, the framework suggests possibilities to extend further to real-time threat monitoring and compliance checks.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10732v1
Towards Dataset Copyright Evasion Attack against Personalized   Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have rapidly advanced, enabling high-quality image generation conditioned on textual prompts. However, the growing trend of fine-tuning pre-trained models for personalization raises serious concerns about unauthorized dataset usage. To combat this, dataset ownership verification (DOV) has emerged as a solution, embedding watermarks into the fine-tuning datasets using backdoor techniques. These watermarks remain inactive under benign samples but produce owner-specified outputs when triggered. Despite the promise of DOV for T2I diffusion models, its robustness against copyright evasion attacks (CEA) remains unexplored. In this paper, we explore how attackers can bypass these mechanisms through CEA, allowing models to circumvent watermarks even when trained on watermarked datasets. We propose the first copyright evasion attack (i.e., CEAT2I) specifically designed to undermine DOV in T2I diffusion models. Concretely, our CEAT2I comprises three stages: watermarked sample detection, trigger identification, and efficient watermark mitigation. A key insight driving our approach is that T2I models exhibit faster convergence on watermarked samples during the fine-tuning, evident through intermediate feature deviation. Leveraging this, CEAT2I can reliably detect the watermarked samples. Then, we iteratively ablate tokens from the prompts of detected watermarked samples and monitor shifts in intermediate features to pinpoint the exact trigger tokens. Finally, we adopt a closed-form concept erasure method to remove the injected watermark. Extensive experiments show that our CEAT2I effectively evades DOV mechanisms while preserving model performance.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02824v1
Defending the Edge: Representative-Attention for Mitigating Backdoor   Attacks in Federated Learning,"Federated learning (FL) enhances privacy and reduces communication cost for resource-constrained edge clients by supporting distributed model training at the edge. However, the heterogeneous nature of such devices produces diverse, non-independent, and identically distributed (non-IID) data, making the detection of backdoor attacks more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel federated representative-attention-based defense mechanism, named FeRA, that leverages cross-client attention over internal feature representations to distinguish benign from malicious clients. FeRA computes an anomaly score based on representation reconstruction errors, effectively identifying clients whose internal activations significantly deviate from the group consensus. Our evaluation demonstrates FeRA's robustness across various FL scenarios, including challenging non-IID data distributions typical of edge devices. Experimental results show that it effectively reduces backdoor attack success rates while maintaining high accuracy on the main task. The method is model-agnostic, attack-agnostic, and does not require labeled reference data, making it well suited to heterogeneous and resource-limited edge deployments.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10297v1
hChain: Blockchain Based Large Scale EHR Data Sharing with Enhanced   Security and Privacy,"Concerns regarding privacy and data security in conventional healthcare prompted alternative technologies. In smart healthcare, blockchain technology addresses existing concerns with security, privacy, and electronic healthcare transmission. Integration of Blockchain Technology with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) allows real-time monitoring of protected healthcare data. Utilizing edge devices with IoMT devices is very advantageous for addressing security, computing, and storage challenges. Encryption using symmetric and asymmetric keys is used to conceal sensitive information from unauthorized parties. SHA256 is an algorithm for one-way hashing. It is used to verify that the data has not been altered, since if it had, the hash value would have changed. This article offers a blockchain-based smart healthcare system using IoMT devices for continuous patient monitoring. In addition, it employs edge resources in addition to IoMT devices to have extra computing power and storage to hash and encrypt incoming data before sending it to the blockchain. Symmetric key is utilized to keep the data private even in the blockchain, allowing the patient to safely communicate the data through smart contracts while preventing unauthorized physicians from seeing the data. Through the use of a verification node and blockchain, an asymmetric key is used for the signing and validation of patient data in the healthcare provider system. In addition to other security measures, location-based authentication is recommended to guarantee that data originates from the patient area. Through the edge device, SHA256 is utilized to secure the data's integrity and a secret key is used to maintain its secrecy. The hChain architecture improves the computing power of IoMT environments, the security of EHR sharing through smart contracts, and the privacy and authentication procedures.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12610v1
MUBox: A Critical Evaluation Framework of Deep Machine Unlearning,"Recent legal frameworks have mandated the right to be forgotten, obligating the removal of specific data upon user requests. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution by selectively removing learned information from machine learning models. This paper presents MUBox, a comprehensive platform designed to evaluate unlearning methods in deep learning. MUBox integrates 23 advanced unlearning techniques, tested across six practical scenarios with 11 diverse evaluation metrics. It allows researchers and practitioners to (1) assess and compare the effectiveness of different machine unlearning methods across various scenarios; (2) examine the impact of current evaluation metrics on unlearning performance; and (3) conduct detailed comparative studies on machine unlearning in a unified framework. Leveraging MUBox, we systematically evaluate these unlearning methods in deep learning and uncover several key insights: (a) Even state-of-the-art unlearning methods, including those published in top-tier venues and winners of unlearning competitions, demonstrate inconsistent effectiveness across diverse scenarios. Prior research has predominantly focused on simplified settings, such as random forgetting and class-wise unlearning, highlighting the need for broader evaluations across more difficult unlearning tasks. (b) Assessing unlearning performance remains a non-trivial problem, as no single evaluation metric can comprehensively capture the effectiveness, efficiency, and preservation of model utility. Our findings emphasize the necessity of employing multiple metrics to achieve a balanced and holistic assessment of unlearning methods. (c) In the context of depoisoning, our evaluation reveals significant variability in the effectiveness of existing approaches, which is highly dependent on the specific type of poisoning attacks.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08576v1
Forensics of Error Rates of Quantum Hardware,"There has been a rise in third-party cloud providers offering quantum hardware as a service to improve performance at lower cost. Although these providers provide flexibility to the users to choose from several qubit technologies, quantum hardware, and coupling maps; the actual execution of the program is not clearly visible to the customer. The success of the user program, in addition to various other metadata such as cost, performance, & number of iterations to converge, depends on the error rate of the backend used. Moreover, the third-party provider and/or tools (e.g., hardware allocator and mapper) may hold insider/outsider adversarial agents to conserve resources and maximize profit by running the quantum circuits on error-prone hardware. Thus it is important to gain visibility of the backend from various perspectives of the computing process e.g., execution, transpilation and outcomes. In this paper, we estimate the error rate of the backend from the original and transpiled circuit. For the forensics, we exploit the fact that qubit mapping and routing steps of the transpilation process select qubits and qubit pairs with less single qubit and two-qubit gate errors to minimize overall error accumulation, thereby, giving us clues about the error rates of the various parts of the backend. We ranked qubit links into bins based on ECR error rates publicly available, and compared it to the rankings derived from our investigation of the relative frequency of a qubit link being chosen by the transpiler. For upto 83.5% of the qubit links in IBM Sherbrooke and 80% in IBM Brisbane, 127 qubit IBM backends, we are able to assign a bin rank which has a difference upto 2 with the bin rank assigned on the basis of actual error rate information.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11706v1
Reliable Disentanglement Multi-view Learning Against View Adversarial   Attacks,"Recently, trustworthy multi-view learning has attracted extensive attention because evidence learning can provide reliable uncertainty estimation to enhance the credibility of multi-view predictions. Existing trusted multi-view learning methods implicitly assume that multi-view data is secure. In practice, however, in safety-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and security monitoring, multi-view data often faces threats from adversarial perturbations, thereby deceiving or disrupting multi-view learning models. This inevitably leads to the adversarial unreliability problem (AUP) in trusted multi-view learning. To overcome this tricky problem, we propose a novel multi-view learning framework, namely Reliable Disentanglement Multi-view Learning (RDML). Specifically, we first propose evidential disentanglement learning to decompose each view into clean and adversarial parts under the guidance of corresponding evidences, which is extracted by a pretrained evidence extractor. Then, we employ the feature recalibration module to mitigate the negative impact of adversarial perturbations and extract potential informative features from them. Finally, to further ignore the irreparable adversarial interferences, a view-level evidential attention mechanism is designed. Extensive experiments on multi-view classification tasks with adversarial attacks show that our RDML outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-view learning methods by a relatively large margin.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04046v1
Explainable Machine Learning for Cyberattack Identification from Traffic   Flows,"The increasing automation of traffic management systems has made them prime targets for cyberattacks, disrupting urban mobility and public safety. Traditional network-layer defenses are often inaccessible to transportation agencies, necessitating a machine learning-based approach that relies solely on traffic flow data. In this study, we simulate cyberattacks in a semi-realistic environment, using a virtualized traffic network to analyze disruption patterns. We develop a deep learning-based anomaly detection system, demonstrating that Longest Stop Duration and Total Jam Distance are key indicators of compromised signals. To enhance interpretability, we apply Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, identifying critical decision factors and diagnosing misclassification errors. Our analysis reveals two primary challenges: transitional data inconsistencies, where mislabeled recovery-phase traffic misleads the model, and model limitations, where stealth attacks in low-traffic conditions evade detection. This work enhances AI-driven traffic security, improving both detection accuracy and trustworthiness in smart transportation systems.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01488v1
Walrus: An Efficient Decentralized Storage Network,"Decentralized storage systems face a fundamental trade-off between replication overhead, recovery efficiency, and security guarantees. Current approaches either rely on full replication, incurring substantial storage costs, or employ trivial erasure coding schemes that struggle with efficient recovery especially under high storage-node churn. We present Walrus, a novel decentralized blob storage system that addresses these limitations through multiple technical innovations. At the core of Walrus is RedStuff, a two-dimensional erasure coding protocol that achieves high security with only 4.5x replication factor, while enabling self-healing recovery that requires bandwidth proportional to only the lost data $(O(|blob|/n)$ versus $O(|blob|)$ in traditional systems). Crucially, RedStuff is the first protocol to support storage challenges in asynchronous networks, preventing adversaries from exploiting network delays to pass verification without actually storing data. Walrus also introduces a novel multi-stage epoch change protocol that efficiently handles storage node churn while maintaining uninterrupted availability during committee transitions. Our system incorporates authenticated data structures to defend against malicious clients and ensures data consistency throughout storage and retrieval processes. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that Walrus achieves practical performance at scale, making it suitable for a wide range of decentralized applications requiring high-integrity, available blob storage with reasonable overhead.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05370v1
Correlating Account on Ethereum Mixing Service via Domain-Invariant   feature learning,"The untraceability of transactions facilitated by Ethereum mixing services like Tornado Cash poses significant challenges to blockchain security and financial regulation. Existing methods for correlating mixing accounts suffer from limited labeled data and vulnerability to noisy annotations, which restrict their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose StealthLink, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through cross-task domain-invariant feature learning. Our key innovation lies in transferring knowledge from the well-studied domain of blockchain anomaly detection to the data-scarce task of mixing transaction tracing. Specifically, we design a MixFusion module that constructs and encodes mixing subgraphs to capture local transactional patterns, while introducing a knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns discriminative features across domains through adversarial discrepancy minimization. This dual approach enables robust feature learning under label scarcity and distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on real-world mixing transaction datasets demonstrate that StealthLink achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 96.98\% F1-score in 10-shot learning scenarios. Notably, our framework shows superior generalization capability in imbalanced data conditions than conventional supervised methods. This work establishes the first systematic approach for cross-domain knowledge transfer in blockchain forensics, providing a practical solution for combating privacy-enhanced financial crimes in decentralized ecosystems.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09892v1
Privacy and Confidentiality Requirements Engineering for Process Data,"The application and development of process mining techniques face significant challenges due to the lack of publicly available real-life event logs. One reason for companies to abstain from sharing their data are privacy and confidentiality concerns. Privacy concerns refer to personal data as specified in the GDPR and have been addressed in existing work by providing privacy-preserving techniques for event logs. However, the concept of confidentiality in event logs not pertaining to individuals remains unclear, although they might contain a multitude of sensitive business data. This work addresses confidentiality of process data based on the privacy and confidentiality engineering method (PCRE). PCRE interactively explores privacy and confidentiality requirements regarding process data with different stakeholders and defines privacy-preserving actions to address possible concerns. We co-construct and evaluate PCRE based on structured interviews with process analysts in two manufacturing companies. PCRE is generic, hence applicable in different application domains. The goal is to systematically scrutinize process data and balance the trade-off between privacy and utility loss.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10965v1
SafeTab-P: Disclosure Avoidance for the 2020 Census Detailed Demographic   and Housing Characteristics File A (Detailed DHC-A),"This article describes the disclosure avoidance algorithm that the U.S. Census Bureau used to protect the Detailed Demographic and Housing Characteristics File A (Detailed DHC-A) of the 2020 Census. The tabulations contain statistics (counts) of demographic characteristics of the entire population of the United States, crossed with detailed races and ethnicities at varying levels of geography. The article describes the SafeTab-P algorithm, which is based on adding noise drawn to statistics of interest from a discrete Gaussian distribution. A key innovation in SafeTab-P is the ability to adaptively choose how many statistics and at what granularity to release them, depending on the size of a population group. We prove that the algorithm satisfies a well-studied variant of differential privacy, called zero-concentrated differential privacy (zCDP). We then describe how the algorithm was implemented on Tumult Analytics and briefly outline the parameterization and tuning of the algorithm.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01472v1
Towards a standardized methodology and dataset for evaluating LLM-based   digital forensic timeline analysis,"Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption in many domains including digital forensics. While prior research has largely centered on case studies and examples demonstrating how LLMs can assist forensic investigations, deeper explorations remain limited, i.e., a standardized approach for precise performance evaluations is lacking. Inspired by the NIST Computer Forensic Tool Testing Program, this paper proposes a standardized methodology to quantitatively evaluate the application of LLMs for digital forensic tasks, specifically in timeline analysis. The paper describes the components of the methodology, including the dataset, timeline generation, and ground truth development. Additionally, the paper recommends using BLEU and ROUGE metrics for the quantitative evaluation of LLMs through case studies or tasks involving timeline analysis. Experimental results using ChatGPT demonstrate that the proposed methodology can effectively evaluate LLM-based forensic timeline analysis. Finally, we discuss the limitations of applying LLMs to forensic timeline analysis.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03100v1
Adaptive Wizard for Removing Cross-Tier Misconfigurations in Active   Directory,"Security vulnerabilities in Windows Active Directory (AD) systems are typically modeled using an attack graph and hardening AD systems involves an iterative workflow: security teams propose an edge to remove, and IT operations teams manually review these fixes before implementing the removal. As verification requires significant manual effort, we formulate an Adaptive Path Removal Problem to minimize the number of steps in this iterative removal process. In our model, a wizard proposes an attack path in each step and presents it as a set of multiple-choice options to the IT admin. The IT admin then selects one edge from the proposed set to remove. This process continues until the target $t$ is disconnected from source $s$ or the number of proposed paths reaches $B$. The model aims to optimize the human effort by minimizing the expected number of interactions between the IT admin and the security wizard. We first prove that the problem is $\mathcal{\#P}$-hard. We then propose a set of solutions including an exact algorithm, an approximate algorithm, and several scalable heuristics. Our best heuristic, called DPR, can operate effectively on larger-scale graphs compared to the exact algorithm and consistently outperforms the approximate algorithm across all graphs. We verify the effectiveness of our algorithms on several synthetic AD graphs and an AD attack graph collected from a real organization.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01028v1
"Standing Firm in 5G: A Single-Round, Dropout-Resilient Secure   Aggregation for Federated Learning","Federated learning (FL) is well-suited to 5G networks, where many mobile devices generate sensitive edge data. Secure aggregation protocols enhance privacy in FL by ensuring that individual user updates reveal no information about the underlying client data. However, the dynamic and large-scale nature of 5G-marked by high mobility and frequent dropouts-poses significant challenges to the effective adoption of these protocols. Existing protocols often require multi-round communication or rely on fixed infrastructure, limiting their practicality. We propose a lightweight, single-round secure aggregation protocol designed for 5G environments. By leveraging base stations for assisted computation and incorporating precomputation, key-homomorphic pseudorandom functions, and t-out-of-k secret sharing, our protocol ensures efficiency, robustness, and privacy. Experiments show strong security guarantees and significant gains in communication and computation efficiency, making the approach well-suited for real-world 5G FL deployments.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07148v1
MTL-UE: Learning to Learn Nothing for Multi-Task Learning,"Most existing unlearnable strategies focus on preventing unauthorized users from training single-task learning (STL) models with personal data. Nevertheless, the paradigm has recently shifted towards multi-task data and multi-task learning (MTL), targeting generalist and foundation models that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Despite their growing importance, MTL data and models have been largely neglected while pursuing unlearnable strategies. This paper presents MTL-UE, the first unified framework for generating unlearnable examples for multi-task data and MTL models. Instead of optimizing perturbations for each sample, we design a generator-based structure that introduces label priors and class-wise feature embeddings which leads to much better attacking performance. In addition, MTL-UE incorporates intra-task and inter-task embedding regularization to increase inter-class separation and suppress intra-class variance which enhances the attack robustness greatly. Furthermore, MTL-UE is versatile with good supports for dense prediction tasks in MTL. It is also plug-and-play allowing integrating existing surrogate-dependent unlearnable methods with little adaptation. Extensive experiments show that MTL-UE achieves superior attacking performance consistently across 4 MTL datasets, 3 base UE methods, 5 model backbones, and 5 MTL task-weighting strategies.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05279v1
"Engineering Risk-Aware, Security-by-Design Frameworks for Assurance of   Large-Scale Autonomous AI Models","As AI models scale to billions of parameters and operate with increasing autonomy, ensuring their safe, reliable operation demands engineering-grade security and assurance frameworks. This paper presents an enterprise-level, risk-aware, security-by-design approach for large-scale autonomous AI systems, integrating standardized threat metrics, adversarial hardening techniques, and real-time anomaly detection into every phase of the development lifecycle. We detail a unified pipeline - from design-time risk assessments and secure training protocols to continuous monitoring and automated audit logging - that delivers provable guarantees of model behavior under adversarial and operational stress. Case studies in national security, open-source model governance, and industrial automation demonstrate measurable reductions in vulnerability and compliance overhead. Finally, we advocate cross-sector collaboration - uniting engineering teams, standards bodies, and regulatory agencies - to institutionalize these technical safeguards within a resilient, end-to-end assurance ecosystem for the next generation of AI.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06409v1
A Character-based Diffusion Embedding Algorithm for Enhancing the   Generation Quality of Generative Linguistic Steganographic Texts,"Generating high-quality steganographic text is a fundamental challenge in the field of generative linguistic steganography. This challenge arises primarily from two aspects: firstly, the capabilities of existing models in text generation are limited; secondly, embedding algorithms fail to effectively mitigate the negative impacts of sensitive information's properties, such as semantic content or randomness. Specifically, to ensure that the recipient can accurately extract hidden information, embedding algorithms often have to consider selecting candidate words with relatively low probabilities. This phenomenon leads to a decrease in the number of high-probability candidate words and an increase in low-probability candidate words, thereby compromising the semantic coherence and logical fluency of the steganographic text and diminishing the overall quality of the generated steganographic material. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel embedding algorithm, character-based diffusion embedding algorithm (CDEA). Unlike existing embedding algorithms that strive to eliminate the impact of sensitive information's properties on the generation process, CDEA leverages sensitive information's properties. It enhances the selection frequency of high-probability candidate words in the candidate pool based on general statistical properties at the character level and grouping methods based on power-law distributions, while reducing the selection frequency of low-probability candidate words in the candidate pool. Furthermore, to ensure the effective transformation of sensitive information in long sequences, we also introduce the XLNet model. Experimental results demonstrate that the combination of CDEA and XLNet significantly improves the quality of generated steganographic text, particularly in terms of perceptual-imperceptibility.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00977v2
Fine-grained Manipulation Attacks to Local Differential Privacy   Protocols for Data Streams,"Local Differential Privacy (LDP) enables massive data collection and analysis while protecting end users' privacy against untrusted aggregators. It has been applied to various data types (e.g., categorical, numerical, and graph data) and application settings (e.g., static and streaming). Recent findings indicate that LDP protocols can be easily disrupted by poisoning or manipulation attacks, which leverage injected/corrupted fake users to send crafted data conforming to the LDP reports. However, current attacks primarily target static protocols, neglecting the security of LDP protocols in the streaming settings. Our research fills the gap by developing novel fine-grained manipulation attacks to LDP protocols for data streams. By reviewing the attack surfaces in existing algorithms, We introduce a unified attack framework with composable modules, which can manipulate the LDP estimated stream toward a target stream. Our attack framework can adapt to state-of-the-art streaming LDP algorithms with different analytic tasks (e.g., frequency and mean) and LDP models (event-level, user-level, w-event level). We validate our attacks theoretically and through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, and finally explore a possible defense mechanism for mitigating these attacks.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01292v1
Enhancing Noisy Functional Encryption for Privacy-Preserving Machine   Learning,"Functional encryption (FE) has recently attracted interest in privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) for its unique ability to compute specific functions on encrypted data. A related line of work focuses on noisy FE, which ensures differential privacy in the output while keeping the data encrypted. We extend the notion of noisy multi-input functional encryption (NMIFE) to (dynamic) noisy multi-client functional encryption ((Dy)NMCFE), which allows for more flexibility in the number of data holders and analyses, while protecting the privacy of the data holder with fine-grained access through the usage of labels. Following our new definition of DyNMCFE, we present DyNo, a concrete inner-product DyNMCFE scheme. Our scheme captures all the functionalities previously introduced in noisy FE schemes, while being significantly more efficient in terms of space and runtime and fulfilling a stronger security notion by allowing the corruption of clients. To further prove the applicability of DyNMCFE, we present a protocol for PPML based on DyNo. According to this protocol, we train a privacy-preserving logistic regression.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05843v1
Impact Analysis of Inference Time Attack of Perception Sensors on   Autonomous Vehicles,"As a safety-critical cyber-physical system, cybersecurity and related safety issues for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have been important research topics for a while. Among all the modules on AVs, perception is one of the most accessible attack surfaces, as drivers and AVs have no control over the outside environment. Most current work targeting perception security for AVs focuses on perception correctness. In this work, we propose an impact analysis based on inference time attacks for autonomous vehicles. We demonstrate in a simulation system that such inference time attacks can also threaten the safety of both the ego vehicle and other traffic participants.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03850v1
Towards AI-Driven Human-Machine Co-Teaming for Adaptive and Agile Cyber   Security Operation Centers,"Security Operations Centers (SOCs) face growing challenges in managing cybersecurity threats due to an overwhelming volume of alerts, a shortage of skilled analysts, and poorly integrated tools. Human-AI collaboration offers a promising path to augment the capabilities of SOC analysts while reducing their cognitive overload. To this end, we introduce an AI-driven human-machine co-teaming paradigm that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance threat intelligence, alert triage, and incident response workflows. We present a vision in which LLM-based AI agents learn from human analysts the tacit knowledge embedded in SOC operations, enabling the AI agents to improve their performance on SOC tasks through this co-teaming. We invite SOCs to collaborate with us to further develop this process and uncover replicable patterns where human-AI co-teaming yields measurable improvements in SOC productivity.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06394v1
Centralized Trust in Decentralized Systems: Unveiling Hidden   Contradictions in Blockchain and Cryptocurrency,"Blockchain technology promises to democratize finance and promote social equity through decentralization, but questions remain about whether current implementations advance or hinder these goals. Through a mixed-methods study combining semi-structured interviews with 13 diverse blockchain stakeholders and analysis of over 3,000 cryptocurrency discussions on Reddit, we examine how trust manifests in cryptocurrency ecosystems despite their decentralized architecture. Our findings uncover that users actively seek out and create centralized trust anchors, such as established exchanges, prominent community figures, and recognized development teams, contradicting blockchain's fundamental promise of trustless interactions. We identify how this contradiction arises from users' mental need for accountability and their reluctance to shoulder the full responsibility of self-custody. The study also reveals how these centralized trust patterns disproportionately impact different user groups, with newer and less technical users showing stronger preferences for centralized intermediaries. This work contributes to our understanding of the inherent tensions between theoretical decentralization and practical implementation in cryptocurrency systems, highlighting the persistent role of centralized trust in supposedly trustless environments.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06661v1
Differential Privacy for Network Assortativity,"The analysis of network assortativity is of great importance for understanding the structural characteristics of and dynamics upon networks. Often, network assortativity is quantified using the assortativity coefficient that is defined based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between vertex degrees. It is well known that a network may contain sensitive information, such as the number of friends of an individual in a social network (which is abstracted as the degree of vertex.). So, the computation of the assortativity coefficient leads to privacy leakage, which increases the urgent need for privacy-preserving protocol. However, there has been no scheme addressing the concern above.   To bridge this gap, in this work, we are the first to propose approaches based on differential privacy (DP for short). Specifically, we design three DP-based algorithms: $Local_{ru}$, $Shuffle_{ru}$, and $Decentral_{ru}$. The first two algorithms, based on Local DP (LDP) and Shuffle DP respectively, are designed for settings where each individual only knows his/her direct friends. In contrast, the third algorithm, based on Decentralized DP (DDP), targets scenarios where each individual has a broader view, i.e., also knowing his/her friends' friends. Theoretically, we prove that each algorithm enables an unbiased estimation of the assortativity coefficient of the network. We further evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms using mean squared error (MSE), showing that $Shuffle_{ru}$ achieves the best performance, followed by $Decentral_{ru}$, with $Local_{ru}$ performing the worst. Note that these three algorithms have different assumptions, so each has its applicability scenario. Lastly, we conduct extensive numerical simulations, which demonstrate that the presented approaches are adequate to achieve the estimation of network assortativity under the demand for privacy protection.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03639v1
Open Challenges in Multi-Agent Security: Towards Secure Systems of   Interacting AI Agents,"Decentralized AI agents will soon interact across internet platforms, creating security challenges beyond traditional cybersecurity and AI safety frameworks. Free-form protocols are essential for AI's task generalization but enable new threats like secret collusion and coordinated swarm attacks. Network effects can rapidly spread privacy breaches, disinformation, jailbreaks, and data poisoning, while multi-agent dispersion and stealth optimization help adversaries evade oversightcreating novel persistent threats at a systemic level. Despite their critical importance, these security challenges remain understudied, with research fragmented across disparate fields including AI security, multi-agent learning, complex systems, cybersecurity, game theory, distributed systems, and technical AI governance. We introduce \textbf{multi-agent security}, a new field dedicated to securing networks of decentralized AI agents against threats that emerge or amplify through their interactionswhether direct or indirect via shared environmentswith each other, humans, and institutions, and characterize fundamental security-performance trade-offs. Our preliminary work (1) taxonomizes the threat landscape arising from interacting AI agents, (2) surveys security-performance tradeoffs in decentralized AI systems, and (3) proposes a unified research agenda addressing open challenges in designing secure agent systems and interaction environments. By identifying these gaps, we aim to guide research in this critical area to unlock the socioeconomic potential of large-scale agent deployment on the internet, foster public trust, and mitigate national security risks in critical infrastructure and defense contexts.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02077v1
Proposal for Improving Google A2A Protocol: Safeguarding Sensitive Data   in Multi-Agent Systems,"A2A, a protocol for AI agent communication, offers a robust foundation for secure AI agent communication. However, it has several critical issues in handling sensitive data, such as payment details, identification documents, and personal information. This paper reviews the existing protocol, identifies its limitations, and proposes specific enhancements to improve security, privacy, and trust. It includes a concrete example to illustrate the problem and solution, research-backed rationales, and implementation considerations, drawing on prior studies to strengthen the arguments and proposed solutions. This proposal includes seven enhancements: short-lived tokens, customer authentication (SCA), granular scopes, explicit consent, direct data transfer, multi-transaction approval, and payment standard compliance. The vacation booking example illustrates how these enhancements reduce risks and enhance user experience.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12490v1
Revealing Weaknesses in Text Watermarking Through Self-Information   Rewrite Attacks,"Text watermarking aims to subtly embed statistical signals into text by controlling the Large Language Model (LLM)'s sampling process, enabling watermark detectors to verify that the output was generated by the specified model. The robustness of these watermarking algorithms has become a key factor in evaluating their effectiveness. Current text watermarking algorithms embed watermarks in high-entropy tokens to ensure text quality. In this paper, we reveal that this seemingly benign design can be exploited by attackers, posing a significant risk to the robustness of the watermark. We introduce a generic efficient paraphrasing attack, the Self-Information Rewrite Attack (SIRA), which leverages the vulnerability by calculating the self-information of each token to identify potential pattern tokens and perform targeted attack. Our work exposes a widely prevalent vulnerability in current watermarking algorithms. The experimental results show SIRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates on seven recent watermarking methods with only 0.88 USD per million tokens cost. Our approach does not require any access to the watermark algorithms or the watermarked LLM and can seamlessly transfer to any LLM as the attack model, even mobile-level models. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more robust watermarking.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05190v2
Representation gaps of rigid planar diagram monoids,"We define non-pivotal analogs of the Temperley-Lieb, Motzkin, and planar rook monoids, and compute bounds for the sizes of their nontrivial simple representations. From this, we assess the two types of monoids in their relative suitability for use in cryptography by comparing their representation gaps and gap ratios. We conclude that the non-pivotal monoids are generally worse for cryptographic purposes.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05846v1
ROSA: Finding Backdoors with Fuzzing,"A code-level backdoor is a hidden access, programmed and concealed within the code of a program. For instance, hard-coded credentials planted in the code of a file server application would enable maliciously logging into all deployed instances of this application. Confirmed software supply chain attacks have led to the injection of backdoors into popular open-source projects, and backdoors have been discovered in various router firmware. Manual code auditing for backdoors is challenging and existing semi-automated approaches can handle only a limited scope of programs and backdoors, while requiring manual reverse-engineering of the audited (binary) program. Graybox fuzzing (automated semi-randomized testing) has grown in popularity due to its success in discovering vulnerabilities and hence stands as a strong candidate for improved backdoor detection. However, current fuzzing knowledge does not offer any means to detect the triggering of a backdoor at runtime. In this work we introduce ROSA, a novel approach (and tool) which combines a state-of-the-art fuzzer (AFL++) with a new metamorphic test oracle, capable of detecting runtime backdoor triggers. To facilitate the evaluation of ROSA, we have created ROSARUM, the first openly available benchmark for assessing the detection of various backdoors in diverse programs. Experimental evaluation shows that ROSA has a level of robustness, speed and automation similar to classical fuzzing. It finds all 17 authentic or synthetic backdooors from ROSARUM in 1h30 on average. Compared to existing detection tools, it can handle a diversity of backdoors and programs and it does not rely on manual reverse-engineering of the fuzzed binary code.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08544v1
Automated Alert Classification and Triage (AACT): An Intelligent System   for the Prioritisation of Cybersecurity Alerts,"Enterprise networks are growing ever larger with a rapidly expanding attack surface, increasing the volume of security alerts generated from security controls. Security Operations Centre (SOC) analysts triage these alerts to identify malicious activity, but they struggle with alert fatigue due to the overwhelming number of benign alerts. Organisations are turning to managed SOC providers, where the problem is amplified by context switching and limited visibility into business processes.   A novel system, named AACT, is introduced that automates SOC workflows by learning from analysts' triage actions on cybersecurity alerts. It accurately predicts triage decisions in real time, allowing benign alerts to be closed automatically and critical ones prioritised. This reduces the SOC queue allowing analysts to focus on the most severe, relevant or ambiguous threats. The system has been trained and evaluated on both real SOC data and an open dataset, obtaining high performance in identifying malicious alerts from benign alerts.   Additionally, the system has demonstrated high accuracy in a real SOC environment, reducing alerts shown to analysts by 61% over six months, with a low false negative rate of 1.36% over millions of alerts.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09843v1
"Constrained Network Adversarial Attacks: Validity, Robustness, and   Transferability","While machine learning has significantly advanced Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), particularly within IoT environments where devices generate large volumes of data and are increasingly susceptible to cyber threats, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Our research reveals a critical flaw in existing adversarial attack methodologies: the frequent violation of domain-specific constraints, such as numerical and categorical limits, inherent to IoT and network traffic. This leads to up to 80.3% of adversarial examples being invalid, significantly overstating real-world vulnerabilities. These invalid examples, though effective in fooling models, do not represent feasible attacks within practical IoT deployments. Consequently, relying on these results can mislead resource allocation for defense, inflating the perceived susceptibility of IoT-enabled NIDS models to adversarial manipulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simpler surrogate models like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) generate more valid adversarial examples compared to complex architectures such as CNNs and LSTMs. Using the MLP as a surrogate, we analyze the transferability of adversarial severity to other ML/DL models commonly used in IoT contexts. This work underscores the importance of considering both domain constraints and model architecture when evaluating and designing robust ML/DL models for security-critical IoT and network applications.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01328v1
DNS Query Forgery: A Client-Side Defense Against Mobile App Traffic   Profiling,"Mobile applications continuously generate DNS queries that can reveal sensitive user behavioral patterns even when communications are encrypted. This paper presents a privacy enhancement framework based on query forgery to protect users against profiling attempts that leverage these background communications. We first mathematically model user profiles as probability distributions over interest categories derived from mobile application traffic. We then evaluate three query forgery strategies -- uniform sampling, TrackMeNot-based generation, and an optimized approach that minimizes Kullback-Leibler divergence -- to quantify their effectiveness in obfuscating user profiles. Then we create a synthetic dataset comprising 1,000 user traces constructed from real mobile application traffic and we extract the user profiles based on DNS traffic. Our evaluation reveals that a 50\% privacy improvement is achievable with less than 20\% traffic overhead when using our approach, while achieving 100\% privacy protection requires approximately 40-60\% additional traffic. We further propose a modular system architecture for practical implementation of our protection mechanisms on mobile devices. This work offers a client-side privacy solution that operates without third-party trust requirements, empowering individual users to defend against traffic analysis without compromising application functionality.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09374v1
Adversarial Sample Generation for Anomaly Detection in Industrial   Control Systems,"Machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. It is crucial for an IDS to learn to recognize adversarial examples before malicious entities exploit them. In this paper, we generated adversarial samples using the Jacobian Saliency Map Attack (JSMA). We validate the generalization and scalability of the adversarial samples to tackle a broad range of real attacks on Industrial Control Systems (ICS). We evaluated the impact by assessing multiple attacks generated using the proposed method. The model trained with adversarial samples detected attacks with 95% accuracy on real-world attack data not used during training. The study was conducted using an operational secure water treatment (SWaT) testbed.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03120v1
One Trigger Token Is Enough: A Defense Strategy for Balancing Safety and   Usability in Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively used across diverse domains, including virtual assistants, automated code generation, and scientific research. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which manipulate the models into generating harmful responses despite safety alignment. Recent studies have shown that current safety-aligned LLMs often undergo the shallow safety alignment, where the first few tokens largely determine whether the response will be harmful. Through comprehensive observations, we find that safety-aligned LLMs and various defense strategies generate highly similar initial tokens in their refusal responses, which we define as safety trigger tokens. Building on this insight, we propose \texttt{D-STT}, a simple yet effective defense algorithm that identifies and explicitly decodes safety trigger tokens of the given safety-aligned LLM to trigger the model's learned safety patterns. In this process, the safety trigger is constrained to a single token, which effectively preserves model usability by introducing minimum intervention in the decoding process. Extensive experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks and benign prompts demonstrate that \ours significantly reduces output harmfulness while preserving model usability and incurring negligible response time overhead, outperforming ten baseline methods.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07167v1
Locally Differentially Private Frequency Estimation via Joint Randomized   Response,"Local Differential Privacy (LDP) has been widely recognized as a powerful tool for providing a strong theoretical guarantee of data privacy to data contributors against an untrusted data collector. Under a typical LDP scheme, each data contributor independently randomly perturbs their data before submitting them to the data collector, which in turn infers valuable statistics about the original data from received perturbed data. Common to existing LDP mechanisms is an inherent trade-off between the level of privacy protection and data utility in the sense that strong data privacy often comes at the cost of reduced data utility. Frequency estimation based on Randomized Response (RR) is a fundamental building block of many LDP mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Randomized Response (JRR) mechanism based on correlated data perturbations to achieve locally differentially private frequency estimation. JRR divides data contributors into disjoint groups of two members and lets those in the same group jointly perturb their binary data to improve frequency-estimation accuracy and achieve the same level of data privacy by hiding the group membership information in contrast to the classical RR mechanism. Theoretical analysis and detailed simulation studies using both real and synthetic datasets show that JRR achieves the same level of data privacy as the classical RR mechanism while improving the frequency-estimation accuracy in the overwhelming majority of the cases by up to two orders of magnitude.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10349v1
LLM-Text Watermarking based on Lagrange Interpolation,"The rapid advancement of LLMs (Large Language Models) has established them as a foundational technology for many AI and ML-powered human computer interactions. A critical challenge in this context is the attribution of LLM-generated text -- either to the specific language model that produced it or to the individual user who embedded their identity via a so-called multi-bit watermark. This capability is essential for combating misinformation, fake news, misinterpretation, and plagiarism. One of the key techniques for addressing this challenge is digital watermarking.   This work presents a watermarking scheme for LLM-generated text based on Lagrange interpolation, enabling the recovery of a multi-bit author identity even when the text has been heavily redacted by an adversary. The core idea is to embed a continuous sequence of points $(x, f(x))$ that lie on a single straight line. The $x$-coordinates are computed pseudorandomly using a cryptographic hash function $H$ applied to the concatenation of the previous token's identity and a secret key $s_k$. Crucially, the $x$-coordinates do not need to be embedded into the text -- only the corresponding $f(x)$ values are embedded. During extraction, the algorithm recovers the original points along with many spurious ones, forming an instance of the Maximum Collinear Points (MCP) problem, which can be solved efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is highly effective, allowing the recovery of the author identity even when as few as three genuine points remain after adversarial manipulation.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05712v3
Privacy Preserving Machine Learning Model Personalization through   Federated Personalized Learning,"The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been driven by significant advances in intelligent system research. However, this progress has raised concerns about data privacy, leading to a growing awareness of the need for privacy-preserving AI. In response, there has been a seismic shift in interest towards the leading paradigm for training Machine Learning (ML) models on decentralized data silos while maintaining data privacy, Federated Learning (FL). This research paper presents a comprehensive performance analysis of a cutting-edge approach to personalize ML model while preserving privacy achieved through Privacy Preserving Machine Learning with the innovative framework of Federated Personalized Learning (PPMLFPL). Regarding the increasing concerns about data privacy, this study evaluates the effectiveness of PPMLFPL addressing the critical balance between personalized model refinement and maintaining the confidentiality of individual user data. According to our analysis, Adaptive Personalized Cross-Silo Federated Learning with Differential Privacy (APPLE+DP) offering efficient execution whereas overall, the use of the Adaptive Personalized Cross-Silo Federated Learning with Homomorphic Encryption (APPLE+HE) algorithm for privacy-preserving machine learning tasks in federated personalized learning settings is strongly suggested. The results offer valuable insights creating it a promising scope for future advancements in the field of privacy-conscious data-driven technologies.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01788v1
When Mitigations Backfire: Timing Channel Attacks and Defense for   PRAC-Based RowHammer Mitigations,"Per Row Activation Counting (PRAC) has emerged as a robust framework for mitigating RowHammer (RH) vulnerabilities in modern DRAM systems. However, we uncover a critical vulnerability: a timing channel introduced by the Alert Back-Off (ABO) protocol and Refresh Management (RFM) commands. We present PRACLeak, a novel attack that exploits these timing differences to leak sensitive information, such as secret keys from vulnerable AES implementations, by monitoring memory access latencies.   To counter this, we propose Timing-Safe PRAC (TPRAC), a defense that eliminates PRAC-induced timing channels without compromising RH mitigation efficacy. TPRAC uses Timing-Based RFMs, issued periodically and independent of memory activity. It requires only a single-entry in-DRAM mitigation queue per DRAM bank and is compatible with existing DRAM standards. Our evaluations demonstrate that TPRAC closes timing channels while incurring only 3.4% performance overhead at the RH threshold of 1024.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10111v3
Allocation of Heterogeneous Resources in General Lotto Games,"The allocation of resources plays an important role in the completion of system objectives and tasks, especially in the presence of strategic adversaries. Optimal allocation strategies are becoming increasingly more complex, given that multiple heterogeneous types of resources are at a system planner's disposal. In this paper, we focus on deriving optimal strategies for the allocation of heterogeneous resources in a well-known competitive resource allocation model known as the General Lotto game. In standard formulations, outcomes are determined solely by the players' allocation strategies of a common, single type of resource across multiple contests. In particular, a player wins a contest if it sends more resources than the opponent. Here, we propose a multi-resource extension where the winner of a contest is now determined not only by the amount of resources allocated, but also by the composition of resource types that are allocated. We completely characterize the equilibrium payoffs and strategies for two distinct formulations. The first consists of a weakest-link/best-shot winning rule, and the second considers a winning rule based on a weighted linear combination of the allocated resources. We then consider a scenario where the resource types are costly to purchase, and derive the players' equilibrium investments in each of the resource types.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02860v1
RevealNet: Distributed Traffic Correlation for Attack Attribution on   Programmable Networks,"Network attackers have increasingly resorted to proxy chains, VPNs, and anonymity networks to conceal their activities. To tackle this issue, past research has explored the applicability of traffic correlation techniques to perform attack attribution, i.e., to identify an attacker's true network location. However, current traffic correlation approaches rely on well-provisioned and centralized systems that ingest flows from multiple network probes to compute correlation scores. Unfortunately, this makes correlation efforts scale poorly for large high-speed networks.   In this paper, we propose RevealNet, a decentralized framework for attack attribution that orchestrates a fleet of P4-programmable switches to perform traffic correlation. RevealNet builds on a set of correlation primitives inspired by prior work on computing and comparing flow sketches -- compact summaries of flows' key characteristics -- to enable efficient, distributed, in-network traffic correlation. Our evaluation suggests that RevealNet achieves comparable accuracy to centralized attack attribution systems while significantly reducing both the computational complexity and bandwidth overheads imposed by correlation tasks.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00618v1
Safeguard-by-Development: A Privacy-Enhanced Development Paradigm for   Multi-Agent Collaboration Systems,"Multi-agent collaboration systems (MACS), powered by large language models (LLMs), solve complex problems efficiently by leveraging each agent's specialization and communication between agents. However, the inherent exchange of information between agents and their interaction with external environments, such as LLM, tools, and users, inevitably introduces significant risks of sensitive data leakage, including vulnerabilities to attacks like prompt injection and reconnaissance. Existing MACS fail to enable privacy controls, making it challenging to manage sensitive information securely. In this paper, we take the first step to address the MACS's data leakage threat at the system development level through a privacy-enhanced development paradigm, Maris. Maris enables rigorous message flow control within MACS by embedding reference monitors into key multi-agent conversation components. We implemented Maris as an integral part of AutoGen, a widely adopted open-source multi-agent development framework. Then, we evaluate Maris for its effectiveness and performance overhead on privacy-critical MACS use cases, including healthcare, supply chain optimization, and personalized recommendation system. The result shows that Maris achieves satisfactory effectiveness, performance overhead and practicability for adoption.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04799v1
Sybil-based Virtual Data Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning,"Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning attacks by malicious adversaries. Existing methods often involve high costs to achieve effective attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a sybil-based virtual data poisoning attack, where a malicious client generates sybil nodes to amplify the poisoning model's impact. To reduce neural network computational complexity, we develop a virtual data generation method based on gradient matching. We also design three schemes for target model acquisition, applicable to online local, online global, and offline scenarios. In simulation, our method outperforms other attack algorithms since our method can obtain a global target model under non-independent uniformly distributed data.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09983v1
Optimal Allocation of Privacy Budget on Hierarchical Data Release,"Releasing useful information from datasets with hierarchical structures while preserving individual privacy presents a significant challenge. Standard privacy-preserving mechanisms, and in particular Differential Privacy, often require careful allocation of a finite privacy budget across different levels and components of the hierarchy. Sub-optimal allocation can lead to either excessive noise, rendering the data useless, or to insufficient protections for sensitive information. This paper addresses the critical problem of optimal privacy budget allocation for hierarchical data release. It formulates this challenge as a constrained optimization problem, aiming to maximize data utility subject to a total privacy budget while considering the inherent trade-offs between data granularity and privacy loss. The proposed approach is supported by theoretical analysis and validated through comprehensive experiments on real hierarchical datasets. These experiments demonstrate that optimal privacy budget allocation significantly enhances the utility of the released data and improves the performance of downstream tasks.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10871v1
From Texts to Shields: Convergence of Large Language Models and   Cybersecurity,"This report explores the convergence of large language models (LLMs) and cybersecurity, synthesizing interdisciplinary insights from network security, artificial intelligence, formal methods, and human-centered design.

Secure Cluster-Based Hierarchical Federated Learning in Vehicular   Networks,"Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for intelligent decision-making in vehicular networks, helping to address challenges such as limited communication resources, high vehicle mobility, and data heterogeneity. However, HFL remains vulnerable to adversarial and unreliable vehicles, whose misleading updates can significantly compromise the integrity and convergence of the global model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel defense framework that integrates dynamic vehicle selection with robust anomaly detection within a cluster-based HFL architecture, specifically designed to counter Gaussian noise and gradient ascent attacks. The framework performs a comprehensive reliability assessment for each vehicle by evaluating historical accuracy, contribution frequency, and anomaly records. Anomaly detection combines Z-score and cosine similarity analyses on model updates to identify both statistical outliers and directional deviations in model updates. To further refine detection, an adaptive thresholding mechanism is incorporated into the cosine similarity metric, dynamically adjusting the threshold based on the historical accuracy of each vehicle to enforce stricter standards for consistently high-performing vehicles. In addition, a weighted gradient averaging mechanism is implemented, which assigns higher weights to gradient updates from more trustworthy vehicles. To defend against coordinated attacks, a cross-cluster consistency check is applied to identify collaborative attacks in which multiple compromised clusters coordinate misleading updates. Together, these mechanisms form a multi-level defense strategy to filter out malicious contributions effectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces convergence time compared to benchmark methods across both 1-hop and 3-hop topologies.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01186v1
The Steganographic Potentials of Language Models,"The potential for large language models (LLMs) to hide messages within plain text (steganography) poses a challenge to detection and thwarting of unaligned AI agents, and undermines faithfulness of LLMs reasoning. We explore the steganographic capabilities of LLMs fine-tuned via reinforcement learning (RL) to: (1) develop covert encoding schemes, (2) engage in steganography when prompted, and (3) utilize steganography in realistic scenarios where hidden reasoning is likely, but not prompted. In these scenarios, we detect the intention of LLMs to hide their reasoning as well as their steganography performance. Our findings in the fine-tuning experiments as well as in behavioral non fine-tuning evaluations reveal that while current models exhibit rudimentary steganographic abilities in terms of security and capacity, explicit algorithmic guidance markedly enhances their capacity for information concealment.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03439v1
Analysing Safety Risks in LLMs Fine-Tuned with Pseudo-Malicious Cyber   Security Data,"The integration of large language models (LLMs) into cyber security applications presents significant opportunities, such as enhancing threat analysis and malware detection, but can also introduce critical risks and safety concerns, including personal data leakage and automated generation of new malware. We present a systematic evaluation of safety risks in fine-tuned LLMs for cyber security applications. Using the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications framework, we assessed seven open-source LLMs: Phi 3 Mini 3.8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Llama 3 8B, Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 2 70B. Our evaluation shows that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all tested LLMs (e.g., the safety score of Llama 3.1 8B against prompt injection drops from 0.95 to 0.15). We propose and evaluate a safety alignment approach that carefully rewords instruction-response pairs to include explicit safety precautions and ethical considerations. This approach demonstrates that it is possible to maintain or even improve model safety while preserving technical utility, offering a practical path forward for developing safer fine-tuning methodologies. This work offers a systematic evaluation for safety risks in LLMs, enabling safer adoption of generative AI in sensitive domains, and contributing towards the development of secure, trustworthy, and ethically aligned LLMs.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09974v1
Verifiably Forgotten? Gradient Differences Still Enable Data   Reconstruction in Federated Unlearning,"Federated Unlearning (FU) has emerged as a critical compliance mechanism for data privacy regulations, requiring unlearned clients to provide verifiable Proof of Federated Unlearning (PoFU) to auditors upon data removal requests. However, we uncover a significant privacy vulnerability: when gradient differences are used as PoFU, honest-but-curious auditors may exploit mathematical correlations between gradient differences and forgotten samples to reconstruct the latter. Such reconstruction, if feasible, would face three key challenges: (i) restricted auditor access to client-side data, (ii) limited samples derivable from individual PoFU, and (iii) high-dimensional redundancy in gradient differences. To overcome these challenges, we propose Inverting Gradient difference to Forgotten data (IGF), a novel learning-based reconstruction attack framework that employs Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. IGF incorporates a tailored pixel-level inversion model optimized via a composite loss that captures both structural and semantic cues. This enables efficient and high-fidelity reconstruction of large-scale samples, surpassing existing methods. To counter this novel attack, we design an orthogonal obfuscation defense that preserves PoFU verification utility while preventing sensitive forgotten data reconstruction. Experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the attack and the robustness of the defense. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IGF.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11097v1
OET: Optimization-based prompt injection Evaluation Toolkit,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, enabling their widespread adoption across various domains. However, their susceptibility to prompt injection attacks poses significant security risks, as adversarial inputs can manipulate model behavior and override intended instructions. Despite numerous defense strategies, a standardized framework to rigorously evaluate their effectiveness, especially under adaptive adversarial scenarios, is lacking. To address this gap, we introduce OET, an optimization-based evaluation toolkit that systematically benchmarks prompt injection attacks and defenses across diverse datasets using an adaptive testing framework. Our toolkit features a modular workflow that facilitates adversarial string generation, dynamic attack execution, and comprehensive result analysis, offering a unified platform for assessing adversarial robustness. Crucially, the adaptive testing framework leverages optimization methods with both white-box and black-box access to generate worst-case adversarial examples, thereby enabling strict red-teaming evaluations. Extensive experiments underscore the limitations of current defense mechanisms, with some models remaining susceptible even after implementing security enhancements.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00843v1
AI-Powered Anomaly Detection with Blockchain for Real-Time Security and   Reliability in Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous Vehicles (AV) proliferation brings important and pressing security and reliability issues that must be dealt with to guarantee public safety and help their widespread adoption. The contribution of the proposed research is towards achieving more secure, reliable, and trustworthy autonomous transportation system by providing more capabilities for anomaly detection, data provenance, and real-time response in safety critical AV deployments. In this research, we develop a new framework that combines the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for real-time anomaly detection with blockchain technology to detect and prevent any malicious activity including sensor failures in AVs. Through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, our approach continually monitors associated multi-sensor data streams to detect anomalous patterns that may represent cyberattacks as well as hardware malfunctions. Further, this framework employs a decentralized platform for securely storing sensor data and anomaly alerts in a blockchain ledger for data incorruptibility and authenticity, while offering transparent forensic features. Moreover, immediate automated response mechanisms are deployed using smart contracts when anomalies are found. This makes the AV system more resilient to attacks from both cyberspace and hardware component failure. Besides, we identify potential challenges of scalability in handling high frequency sensor data, computational constraint in resource constrained environment, and of distributed data storage in terms of privacy.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06632v1
Shuffling Cards When You Are of Very Little Brain: Low Memory Generation   of Permutations,"How can we generate a permutation of the numbers $1$ through $n$ so that it is hard to guess the next element given the history so far? The twist is that the generator of the permutation (the ``Dealer"") has limited memory, while the ``Guesser"" has unlimited memory. With unbounded memory (actually $n$ bits suffice), the Dealer can generate a truly random permutation where~$\ln n$ is the expected number of correct guesses.   Our main results are tight bounds for the relationship between the guessing probability and the memory required to generate the permutation. We suggest a method for the Dealer that requires~$m$ bits of storage, constant time for each turn and makes any Guesser pick correctly only $O(n/m+\log m)$ cards in expectation. The method does not require any secrecy from the dealer, i.e. it is ``open book"" or ``whitebox"". On the other hand, we show that this bound is the best possible, even for Dealers with secret memory: For any $m$-bit Dealer there is a (computationally powerful) guesser that makes $\Omega(n/m+\log m)$ correct guesses in expectation.   We also give an $O(n)$ bit memory Dealer that generates perfectly random permutations and operates in constant time per turn.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01287v1
Nonmalleable Progress Leakage,"Information-flow control systems often enforce progress-insensitive noninterference, as it is simple to understand and enforce. Unfortunately, real programs need to declassify results and endorse inputs, which noninterference disallows, while preventing attackers from controlling leakage, including through progress channels, which progress-insensitivity ignores.   This work combines ideas for progress-sensitive security with secure downgrading (declassification and endorsement) to identify a notion of securely downgrading progress information. We use hyperproperties to distill the separation between progress-sensitive and progress-insensitive noninterference and combine it with nonmalleable information flow, an existing (progress-insensitive) definition of secure downgrading, to define nonmalleable progress leakage (NMPL). We present the first information-flow type system to allow some progress leakage while enforcing NMPL, and we show how to infer the location of secure progress downgrades. All theorems are verified in Rocq.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12210v1
RedTeamLLM: an Agentic AI framework for offensive security,"From automated intrusion testing to discovery of zero-day attacks before software launch, agentic AI calls for great promises in security engineering. This strong capability is bound with a similar threat: the security and research community must build up its models before the approach is leveraged by malicious actors for cybercrime. We therefore propose and evaluate RedTeamLLM, an integrated architecture with a comprehensive security model for automatization of pentest tasks. RedTeamLLM follows three key steps: summarizing, reasoning and act, which embed its operational capacity. This novel framework addresses four open challenges: plan correction, memory management, context window constraint, and generality vs. specialization. Evaluation is performed through the automated resolution of a range of entry-level, but not trivial, CTF challenges. The contribution of the reasoning capability of our agentic AI framework is specifically evaluated.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06913v1
Modeling Interdependent Cybersecurity Threats Using Bayesian Networks: A   Case Study on In-Vehicle Infotainment Systems,"Cybersecurity threats are increasingly marked by interdependence, uncertainty, and evolving complexity challenges that traditional assessment methods such as CVSS, STRIDE, and attack trees fail to adequately capture. This paper reviews the application of Bayesian Networks (BNs) in cybersecurity risk modeling, highlighting their capacity to represent probabilistic dependencies, integrate diverse threat indicators, and support reasoning under uncertainty. A structured case study is presented in which a STRIDE-based attack tree for an automotive In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system is transformed into a Bayesian Network. Logical relationships are encoded using Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs), and threat likelihoods are derived from normalized DREAD scores. The model enables not only probabilistic inference of system compromise likelihood but also supports causal analysis using do-calculus and local sensitivity analysis to identify high-impact vulnerabilities. These analyses provide insight into the most influential nodes within the threat propagation chain, informing targeted mitigation strategies. While demonstrating the potential of BNs for dynamic and context-aware risk assessment, the study also outlines limitations related to scalability, reliance on expert input, static structure assumptions, and limited temporal modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for future enhancements through Dynamic Bayesian Networks, structure learning, and adaptive inference to better support real-time cybersecurity decision-making in complex environments.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09048v1
Securing Immersive 360 Video Streams through Attribute-Based Selective   Encryption,"Delivering high-quality, secure 360{\deg} video content introduces unique challenges, primarily due to the high bitrates and interactive demands of immersive media. Traditional HTTPS-based methods, although widely used, face limitations in computational efficiency and scalability when securing these high-resolution streams. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel framework integrating Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) with selective encryption techniques tailored specifically for tiled 360{\deg} video streaming. Our approach employs selective encryption of frames at varying levels to reduce computational overhead while ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access.   Moreover, we explore viewport-adaptive encryption, dynamically encrypting more frames within tiles occupying larger portions of the viewer's field of view. This targeted method significantly enhances security in critical viewing areas without unnecessary overhead in peripheral regions. We deploy and evaluate our proposed approach using the CloudLab testbed, comparing its performance against traditional HTTPS streaming. Experimental results demonstrate that our ABE-based model achieves reduced computational load on intermediate caches, improves cache hit rates, and maintains comparable visual quality to HTTPS, as assessed by Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF).",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04466v1
EPSpatial: Achieving Efficient and Private Statistical Analytics of   Geospatial Data,"Geospatial data statistics involve the aggregation and analysis of location data to derive the distribution of clients within geospatial. The need for privacy protection in geospatial data analysis has become paramount due to concerns over the misuse or unauthorized access of client location information. However, existing private geospatial data statistics mainly rely on privacy computing techniques such as cryptographic tools and differential privacy, which leads to significant overhead and inaccurate results. In practical applications, geospatial data is frequently generated by mobile devices such as smartphones and IoT sensors. The continuous mobility of clients and the need for real-time updates introduce additional complexity. To address these issues, we first design \textit{spatially distributed point functions (SDPF)}, which combines a quad-tree structure with distributed point functions, allowing clients to succinctly secret-share values on the nodes of an exponentially large quad-tree. Then, we use Gray code to partition the region and combine SDPF with it to propose $\mathtt{EPSpatial}$, a scheme for accurate, efficient, and private statistical analytics of geospatial data. Moreover, considering clients' frequent movement requires continuous location updates, we leverage the region encoding property to present an efficient update algorithm.Security analysis shows that $\mathtt{EPSpatial}$ effectively protects client location privacy. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that $\mathtt{EPSpatial}$ reduces computational and communication overhead by at least $50\%$ compared to existing statistical schemes.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12612v1
MixBridge: Heterogeneous Image-to-Image Backdoor Attack through Mixture   of Schrödinger Bridges,"This paper focuses on implanting multiple heterogeneous backdoor triggers in bridge-based diffusion models designed for complex and arbitrary input distributions. Existing backdoor formulations mainly address single-attack scenarios and are limited to Gaussian noise input models. To fill this gap, we propose MixBridge, a novel diffusion Schr\""odinger bridge (DSB) framework to cater to arbitrary input distributions (taking I2I tasks as special cases). Beyond this trait, we demonstrate that backdoor triggers can be injected into MixBridge by directly training with poisoned image pairs. This eliminates the need for the cumbersome modifications to stochastic differential equations required in previous studies, providing a flexible tool to study backdoor behavior for bridge models. However, a key question arises: can a single DSB model train multiple backdoor triggers? Unfortunately, our theory shows that when attempting this, the model ends up following the geometric mean of benign and backdoored distributions, leading to performance conflict across backdoor tasks. To overcome this, we propose a Divide-and-Merge strategy to mix different bridges, where models are independently pre-trained for each specific objective (Divide) and then integrated into a unified model (Merge). In addition, a Weight Reallocation Scheme (WRS) is also designed to enhance the stealthiness of MixBridge. Empirical studies across diverse generation tasks speak to the efficacy of MixBridge.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08809v1
Safety Analysis in the NGAC Model,"We study the safety problem for the next-generation access control (NGAC) model.

We also show that real-world examples of mutually exclusive attributes lead to nearly worst-case behavior of our algorithm.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06406v1
Balancing Security and Liquidity: A Time-Weighted Snapshot Framework for   DAO Governance Voting,"As new project upgrading the blockchain industry, novel forms of attack challenges developers to rethink about the design of their innovations. In the growth stage of the development, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) introduces different approaches in managing fund through voting in governance tokens. However, relying on tokens as a weight for voting introduces opportunities for hackers to manipulate voting results through flash loan, allowing malicious proposals - fund withdrawal from DAO to hacker's wallet - to execute through the smart contract. In this research, we learned different defense mechanism against the flash loan attack, and their weakness in accessibility that compromise the security of different blockchain projects. Based on our observation, we propose a new defensing structure and apply it with cases.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00888v2
Economic Security of Multiple Shared Security Protocols,"As restaking protocols gain adoption across blockchain ecosystems, there is a need for Actively Validated Services (AVSs) to span multiple Shared Security Providers (SSPs). This leads to stake fragmentation which introduces new complications where an adversary may compromise an AVS by targeting its weakest SSP. In this paper, we formalize the Multiple SSP Problem and analyze two architectures : an isolated fragmented model called Model $\mathbb{M}$ and a shared unified model called Model $\mathbb{S}$, through a convex optimization and game-theoretic lens. We derive utility bounds, attack cost conditions, and market equilibrium that describes protocol security for both models. Our results show that while Model $\mathbb{M}$ offers deployment flexibility, it inherits lowest-cost attack vulnerabilities, whereas Model $\mathbb{S}$ achieves tighter security guarantees through single validator sets and aggregated slashing logic. We conclude with future directions of work including an incentive-compatible stake rebalancing allocation in restaking ecosystems.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03843v2
Towards Centralized Orchestration of Cyber Protection Condition (CPCON),"The United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) Cyber Protection Condition (CPCON) framework mandates graduated security postures across Department of Defense (DoD) networks, but current implementation remains largely manual, inconsistent, and error-prone. This paper presents a prototype system for centralized orchestration of CPCON directives, enabling automated policy enforcement and real-time threat response across heterogeneous network environments. Building on prior work in host-based intrusion response, our system leverages a policy-driven orchestrator to standardize security actions, isolate compromised subnets, and verify enforcement status. We validate the system through emulated attack scenarios, demonstrating improved speed, accuracy, and verifiability in CPCON transitions with human-in-the-loop oversight.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12613v1
Input-Specific and Universal Adversarial Attack Generation for Spiking   Neural Networks in the Spiking Domain,"As Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) gain traction across various applications, understanding their security vulnerabilities becomes increasingly important. In this work, we focus on the adversarial attacks, which is perhaps the most concerning threat. An adversarial attack aims at finding a subtle input perturbation to fool the network's decision-making. We propose two novel adversarial attack algorithms for SNNs: an input-specific attack that crafts adversarial samples from specific dataset inputs and a universal attack that generates a reusable patch capable of inducing misclassification across most inputs, thus offering practical feasibility for real-time deployment. The algorithms are gradient-based operating in the spiking domain proving to be effective across different evaluation metrics, such as adversarial accuracy, stealthiness, and generation time. Experimental results on two widely used neuromorphic vision datasets, NMNIST and IBM DVS Gesture, show that our proposed attacks surpass in all metrics all existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we present the first demonstration of adversarial attack generation in the sound domain using the SHD dataset.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06299v1
Privacy Risks and Preservation Methods in Explainable Artificial   Intelligence: A Scoping Review,"Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a pillar of Trustworthy AI and aims to bring transparency in complex models that are opaque by nature. Despite the benefits of incorporating explanations in models, an urgent need is found in addressing the privacy concerns of providing this additional information to end users. In this article, we conduct a scoping review of existing literature to elicit details on the conflict between privacy and explainability. Using the standard methodology for scoping review, we extracted 57 articles from 1,943 studies published from January 2019 to December 2024. The review addresses 3 research questions to present readers with more understanding of the topic: (1) what are the privacy risks of releasing explanations in AI systems? (2) what current methods have researchers employed to achieve privacy preservation in XAI systems? (3) what constitutes a privacy preserving explanation? Based on the knowledge synthesized from the selected studies, we categorize the privacy risks and preservation methods in XAI and propose the characteristics of privacy preserving explanations to aid researchers and practitioners in understanding the requirements of XAI that is privacy compliant. Lastly, we identify the challenges in balancing privacy with other system desiderata and provide recommendations for achieving privacy preserving XAI. We expect that this review will shed light on the complex relationship of privacy and explainability, both being the fundamental principles of Trustworthy AI.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02828v1
On the Price of Differential Privacy for Spectral Clustering over   Stochastic Block Models,"We investigate privacy-preserving spectral clustering for community detection within stochastic block models (SBMs). Specifically, we focus on edge differential privacy (DP) and propose private algorithms for community recovery. Our work explores the fundamental trade-offs between the privacy budget and the accurate recovery of community labels. Furthermore, we establish information-theoretic conditions that guarantee the accuracy of our methods, providing theoretical assurances for successful community recovery under edge DP.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05816v1
A Geometry-Grounded Data Perimeter in Azure,"While data perimeter is ubiquitous in cybersecurity speak, it rarely defines how boundary points are arranged. In this paper we show how Azure s blast radius ultrametric provides the distance, and how solving the Traveling Salesman Problem in this ultrametric space provides the ordering, yielding a true geometric contour: an actionable perimeter measure for SPN prioritization.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13238v1
Private LoRA Fine-tuning of Open-Source LLMs with Homomorphic Encryption,"Preserving data confidentiality during the fine-tuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for sensitive applications. This work introduces an interactive protocol adapting the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique for private fine-tuning. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) protects the confidentiality of training data and gradients handled by remote worker nodes performing the bulk of computations involving the base model weights. The data owner orchestrates training, requiring minimal local computing power and memory, thus alleviating the need for expensive client-side GPUs. We demonstrate feasibility by fine-tuning a Llama-3.2-1B model, presenting convergence results using HE-compatible quantization and performance benchmarks for HE computations on GPU hardware. This approach enables applications such as confidential knowledge base question answering, private codebase fine-tuning for AI code assistants, AI agents for drafting emails based on a company's email archive, and adapting models to analyze sensitive legal or healthcare documents.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07329v1
Winning at All Cost: A Small Environment for Eliciting Specification   Gaming Behaviors in Large Language Models,"This study reveals how frontier Large Language Models LLMs can ""game the system"" when faced with impossible situations, a critical security and alignment concern. Using a novel textual simulation approach, we presented three leading LLMs (o1, o3-mini, and r1) with a tic-tac-toe scenario designed to be unwinnable through legitimate play, then analyzed their tendency to exploit loopholes rather than accept defeat. Our results are alarming for security researchers: the newer, reasoning-focused o3-mini model showed nearly twice the propensity to exploit system vulnerabilities (37.1%) compared to the older o1 model (17.5%). Most striking was the effect of prompting. Simply framing the task as requiring ""creative"" solutions caused gaming behaviors to skyrocket to 77.3% across all models. We identified four distinct exploitation strategies, from direct manipulation of game state to sophisticated modification of opponent behavior. These findings demonstrate that even without actual execution capabilities, LLMs can identify and propose sophisticated system exploits when incentivized, highlighting urgent challenges for AI alignment as models grow more capable of identifying and leveraging vulnerabilities in their operating environments.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07846v1
Efficient Malicious UAV Detection Using Autoencoder-TSMamba Integration,"Malicious Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) present a significant threat to next-generation networks (NGNs), posing risks such as unauthorized surveillance, data theft, and the delivery of hazardous materials. This paper proposes an integrated (AE)-classifier system to detect malicious UAVs. The proposed AE, based on a 4-layer Tri-orientated Spatial Mamba (TSMamba) architecture, effectively captures complex spatial relationships crucial for identifying malicious UAV activities. The first phase involves generating residual values through the AE, which are subsequently processed by a ResNet-based classifier. This classifier leverages the residual values to achieve lower complexity and higher accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both binary and multi-class classification scenarios, achieving up to 99.8 % recall compared to 96.7 % in the benchmark. Additionally, our method reduces computational complexity, making it more suitable for large-scale deployment. These results highlight the robustness and scalability of our approach, offering an effective solution for malicious UAV detection in NGN environments.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10585v1
OBLIVIATE: Robust and Practical Machine Unlearning for Large Language   Models,"Large language models (LLMs) trained over extensive corpora risk memorizing sensitive, copyrighted, or toxic content. To address this, we propose OBLIVIATE, a robust unlearning framework that removes targeted data while preserving model utility. The framework follows a structured process: extracting target tokens, building retain sets, and fine-tuning with a tailored loss function comprising three components -- masking, distillation, and world fact. Using low-rank adapters (LoRA), it ensures efficiency without compromising unlearning quality. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets, including the Harry Potter series, WMDP, and TOFU, using a comprehensive suite of metrics: forget quality (new document-level memorization score), model utility, and fluency. Results demonstrate its effectiveness in resisting membership inference attacks, minimizing the impact on retained data, and maintaining robustness across diverse scenarios.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04416v1
A Proposal for Evaluating the Operational Risk for ChatBots based on   Large Language Models,"The emergence of Generative AI (Gen AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled more advanced chatbots capable of human-like interactions. However, these conversational agents introduce a broader set of operational risks that extend beyond traditional cybersecurity considerations. In this work, we propose a novel, instrumented risk-assessment metric that simultaneously evaluates potential threats to three key stakeholders: the service-providing organization, end users, and third parties. Our approach incorporates the technical complexity required to induce erroneous behaviors in the chatbot--ranging from non-induced failures to advanced prompt-injection attacks--as well as contextual factors such as the target industry, user age range, and vulnerability severity. To validate our metric, we leverage Garak, an open-source framework for LLM vulnerability testing. We further enhance Garak to capture a variety of threat vectors (e.g., misinformation, code hallucinations, social engineering, and malicious code generation). Our methodology is demonstrated in a scenario involving chatbots that employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), showing how the aggregated risk scores guide both short-term mitigation and longer-term improvements in model design and deployment. The results underscore the importance of multi-dimensional risk assessments in operationalizing secure, reliable AI-driven conversational systems.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04784v1
A Chaos Driven Metric for Backdoor Attack Detection,"The advancement and adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models across diverse domains have transformed the way we interact with technology. However, it is essential to recognize that while AI models have introduced remarkable advancements, they also present inherent challenges such as their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. The current work proposes a novel defense mechanism against one of the most significant attack vectors of AI models - the backdoor attack via data poisoning of training datasets. In this defense technique, an integrated approach that combines chaos theory with manifold learning is proposed. A novel metric - Precision Matrix Dependency Score (PDS) that is based on the conditional variance of Neurochaos features is formulated. The PDS metric has been successfully evaluated to distinguish poisoned samples from non-poisoned samples across diverse datasets.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03208v1
Directed Greybox Fuzzing via Large Language Model,"Directed greybox fuzzing (DGF) focuses on efficiently reaching specific program locations or triggering particular behaviors, making it essential for tasks like vulnerability detection and crash reproduction. However, existing methods often suffer from path explosion and randomness in input mutation, leading to inefficiencies in exploring and exploiting target paths. In this paper, we propose HGFuzzer, an automatic framework that leverages the large language model (LLM) to address these challenges. HGFuzzer transforms path constraint problems into targeted code generation tasks, systematically generating test harnesses and reachable inputs to reduce unnecessary exploration paths significantly. Additionally, we implement custom mutators designed specifically for target functions, minimizing randomness and improving the precision of directed fuzzing. We evaluated HGFuzzer on 20 real-world vulnerabilities, successfully triggering 17, including 11 within the first minute, achieving a speedup of at least 24.8x compared to state-of-the-art directed fuzzers. Furthermore, HGFuzzer discovered 9 previously unknown vulnerabilities, all of which were assigned CVE IDs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in identifying real-world vulnerabilities.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03425v1
On Technique Identification and Threat-Actor Attribution using LLMs and   Embedding Models,"Attribution of cyber-attacks remains a complex but critical challenge for cyber defenders. Currently, manual extraction of behavioral indicators from dense forensic documentation causes significant attribution delays, especially following major incidents at the international scale. This research evaluates large language models (LLMs) for cyber-attack attribution based on behavioral indicators extracted from forensic documentation. We test OpenAI's GPT-4 and text-embedding-3-large for identifying threat actors' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) by comparing LLM-generated TTPs against human-generated data from MITRE ATT&CK Groups. Our framework then identifies TTPs from text using vector embedding search and builds profiles to attribute new attacks for a machine learning model to learn. Key contributions include: (1) assessing off-the-shelf LLMs for TTP extraction and attribution, and (2) developing an end-to-end pipeline from raw CTI documents to threat-actor prediction. This research finds that standard LLMs generate TTP datasets with noise, resulting in a low similarity to human-generated datasets. However, the TTPs generated are similar in frequency to those within the existing MITRE datasets. Additionally, although these TTPs are different than human-generated datasets, our work demonstrates that they still prove useful for training a model that performs above baseline on attribution. Project code and files are contained here: https://github.com/kylag/ttp_attribution.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11547v1
Guardian Positioning System (GPS) for Location Based Services,"Location-based service (LBS) applications proliferate and support transportation, entertainment, and more. Modern mobile platforms, with smartphones being a prominent example, rely on terrestrial and satellite infrastructures (e.g., global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and crowdsourced Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, and IP databases) for correct positioning. However, they are vulnerable to attacks that manipulate positions to control and undermine LBS functionality -- thus enabling the scamming of users or services. Our work reveals that GNSS spoofing attacks succeed even though smartphones have multiple sources of positioning information. Moreover, that Wi-Fi spoofing attacks with GNSS jamming are surprisingly effective. More concerning is the evidence that sophisticated, coordinated spoofing attacks are highly effective. Attacks can target GNSS in combination with other positioning methods, thus defenses that assume that only GNSS is under attack cannot be effective. More so, resilient GNSS receivers and special-purpose antennas are not feasible on smartphones. To address this gap, we propose an extended receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) framework that leverages the readily available, redundant, often so-called opportunistic positioning information on off-the-shelf platforms. We jointly use onboard sensors, terrestrial infrastructures, and GNSS. We show that our extended RAIM framework improves resilience against location spoofing, e.g., achieving a detection accuracy improvement of up to 24-58% compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms and location providers; detecting attacks within 5 seconds, with a low false positive rate.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09743v1
FedRE: Robust and Effective Federated Learning with Privacy Preference,"Despite Federated Learning (FL) employing gradient aggregation at the server for distributed training to prevent the privacy leakage of raw data, private information can still be divulged through the analysis of uploaded gradients from clients. Substantial efforts have been made to integrate local differential privacy (LDP) into the system to achieve a strict privacy guarantee. However, existing methods fail to take practical issues into account by merely perturbing each sample with the same mechanism while each client may have their own privacy preferences on privacy-sensitive information (PSI), which is not uniformly distributed across the raw data. In such a case, excessive privacy protection from private-insensitive information can additionally introduce unnecessary noise, which may degrade the model performance. In this work, we study the PSI within data and develop FedRE, that can simultaneously achieve robustness and effectiveness benefits with LDP protection. More specifically, we first define PSI with regard to the privacy preferences of each client. Then, we optimize the LDP by allocating less privacy budget to gradients with higher PSI in a layer-wise manner, thus providing a stricter privacy guarantee for PSI. Furthermore, to mitigate the performance degradation caused by LDP, we design a parameter aggregation mechanism based on the distribution of the perturbed information. We conducted experiments with text tamper detection on T-SROIE and DocTamper datasets, and FedRE achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04889v1
Kudzu: Fast and Simple High-Throughput BFT,"We present Kudzu, a high-throughput atomic broadcast protocol with an integrated fast path. Our contribution is based on the combination of two lines of work. Firstly, our protocol achieves finality in just two rounds of communication if all but $p$ out of $n = 3f + 2p + 1$ participating replicas behave correctly, where $f$ is the number of Byzantine faults that are tolerated. Due to the seamless integration of the fast path, even in the presence of more than $p$ faults, our protocol maintains state-of-the-art characteristics. Secondly, our protocol utilizes the bandwidth of participating replicas in a balanced way, alleviating the bottleneck at the leader, and thus enabling high throughput. This is achieved by disseminating blocks using erasure codes. Despite combining a novel set of advantages, Kudzu is remarkably simple: intricacies such as progress certificates, complex view changes, and speculative execution are avoided.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08771v1
Mitigating Backdoor Triggered and Targeted Data Poisoning Attacks in   Voice Authentication Systems,"Voice authentication systems remain susceptible to two major threats: backdoor triggered attacks and targeted data poisoning attacks. This dual vulnerability is critical because conventional solutions typically address each threat type separately, leaving systems exposed to adversaries who can exploit both attacks simultaneously. We propose a unified defense framework that effectively addresses both BTA and TDPA. Our framework integrates a frequency focused detection mechanism that flags covert pitch boosting and sound masking backdoor attacks in near real time, followed by a convolutional neural network that addresses TDPA. This dual layered defense approach utilizes multidimensional acoustic features to isolate anomalous signals without requiring costly model retraining. In particular, our PBSM detection mechanism can seamlessly integrate into existing voice authentication pipelines and scale effectively for large scale deployments. Experimental results on benchmark datasets and their compression with the state of the art algorithm demonstrate that our PBSM detection mechanism outperforms the state of the art. Our framework reduces attack success rates to as low as five to fifteen percent while maintaining a recall rate of up to ninety five percent in recognizing TDPA.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03455v1
Scaling an ISO Compliance Practice: Strategic Insights from Building a   \$1m+ Cybersecurity Certification Line,"The rapid exponential growth in cloud-first business models and tightened global data protection regulations have led to the exponential increase in the level of importance of ISO certifications, especially ISO/IEC 27001, 27017, and 27018, as strategic imperative propositions for organizations wanting to build trust, ensure compliance, and achieve a competitive advantage. This article describes a case study of a successful design, implementation, and scaling of a cybersecurity certification practice in Armanino LLP, a pioneering US accounting and consulting firm. In reaction to increasing client desires for formalized information security frameworks, I founded an industry practice from conception through implementation to aid mid-market and high-growth technology firms. During one year, the initiative brought in over \$1 million in new service revenue, expanded our portfolio of cybersecurity clients by 150%, and produced more than 20 successful ISO certifications on various verticals such as SaaS, healthcare, and fintech. Based on the strategic wisdom and operational strategy, this paper outlines the technical architecture of the ISO service line from modular audit templates to certification readiness kits, from stakeholder enablement to integration with SOC 2 and CIS controls. The approach gave value to repeatability, speed, and assurance, thus making Armanino a reputable certification body. The lessons drawn out provide us with a flexible template that can be utilized by firms wishing to build strong compliance programs that can be tailored to address changing digital risk terrains. This work adds to the increasing knowledge about audit scalability, cybersecurity compliance, and ISO standardisation.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11583v1
Cryptologic Techniques and Associated Risks in Public and Private   Security. An Italian and European Union Perspective with an Overview of the   Current Legal Framework,"This article examines the evolution of cryptologic techniques and their implications for public and private security, focusing on the Italian and EU legal frameworks. It explores the roles of cryptography, steganography, and quantum technologies in countering cybersecurity threats, emphasising the need for robust legislation to address emerging challenges. Special attention is given to Italy's legislative reforms, including Law No. 90 of 2024, which strengthens penalties for cybercrimes and establishes the National Cryptography Centre within the Italian National Cybersecurity Agency.

Large Language Models are Autonomous Cyber Defenders,"Fast and effective incident response is essential to prevent adversarial cyberattacks. Autonomous Cyber Defense (ACD) aims to automate incident response through Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents that plan and execute actions. Most ACD approaches focus on single-agent scenarios and leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, ACD RL-trained agents depend on costly training, and their reasoning is not always explainable or transferable. Large Language Models (LLMs) can address these concerns by providing explainable actions in general security contexts. Researchers have explored LLM agents for ACD but have not evaluated them on multi-agent scenarios or interacting with other ACD agents. In this paper, we show the first study on how LLMs perform in multi-agent ACD environments by proposing a new integration to the CybORG CAGE 4 environment. We examine how ACD teams of LLM and RL agents can interact by proposing a novel communication protocol. Our results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs and RL and help us identify promising research directions to create, train, and deploy future teams of ACD agents.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04843v1
Lara: Lightweight Anonymous Authentication with Asynchronous Revocation   Auditability,"Anonymous authentication is a technique that allows to combine access control with privacy preservation. Typically, clients use different pseudonyms for each access, hindering providers from correlating their activities. To perform the revocation of pseudonyms in a privacy preserving manner is notoriously challenging. When multiple pseudonyms are revoked together, an adversary may infer that these pseudonyms belong to the same client and perform privacy breaking correlations, in particular if these pseudonyms have already been used. Backward unlinkability and revocation auditability are two properties that address this problem. Most systems that offer these properties rely on some sort of time slots, which assume a common reference of time that must be shared among clients and providers; for instance, the client must be aware that it should not use a pseudonym after a certain time or should be able to assess the freshness of a revocation list prior to perform authentication. In this paper we propose Lara, a Lightweight Anonymous Authentication with Asynchronous Revocation Auditability that does not require parties to agree on the current time slot and it is not affected by the clock skew. Prior to disclosing a pseudonym, clients are provided with a revocation list (RL) and can check that the pseudonym has not been revoked. Then, they provide a proof on non-revocation that cannot be used against any other (past or future) RL, avoiding any dependency of timing assumptions. Lara can be implemented using efficient public-key primitives and space-efficient data structures. We have implemented a prototype of Lara and have assessed experimentally its efficiency.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12968v1
AutoPatch: Multi-Agent Framework for Patching Real-World CVE   Vulnerabilities,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools in software development, enabling automated code generation and analysis. However, their knowledge is limited to a fixed cutoff date, making them prone to generating code vulnerable to newly disclosed CVEs. Frequent fine-tuning with new CVE sets is costly, and existing LLM-based approaches focus on oversimplified CWE examples and require providing explicit bug locations to LLMs, limiting their ability to patch complex real-world vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we propose AutoPatch, a multi-agent framework designed to patch vulnerable LLM-generated code, particularly those introduced after the LLMs' knowledge cutoff. AutoPatch integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a structured database of recently disclosed vulnerabilities, comprising 525 code snippets derived from 75 high-severity CVEs across real-world systems such as the Linux kernel and Chrome. AutoPatch combines semantic and taint analysis to identify the most relevant CVE and leverages enhanced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to construct enriched prompts for verification and patching. Our unified similarity model, which selects the most relevant vulnerabilities, achieves 90.4 percent accuracy in CVE matching. AutoPatch attains 89.5 percent F1-score for vulnerability verification and 95.0 percent accuracy in patching, while being over 50x more cost-efficient than traditional fine-tuning approaches.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04195v1
SecEmb: Sparsity-Aware Secure Federated Learning of On-Device   Recommender System with Large Embedding,"Federated recommender system (FedRec) has emerged as a solution to protect user data through collaborative training techniques. A typical FedRec involves transmitting the full model and entire weight updates between edge devices and the server, causing significant burdens to devices with limited bandwidth and computational power. While the sparsity of embedding updates provides opportunity for payload optimization, existing sparsity-aware federated protocols generally sacrifice privacy for efficiency. A key challenge in designing a secure sparsity-aware efficient protocol is to protect the rated item indices from the server. In this paper, we propose a lossless secure recommender systems on sparse embedding updates (SecEmb). SecEmb reduces user payload while ensuring that the server learns no information about both rated item indices and individual updates except the aggregated model. The protocol consists of two correlated modules: (1) a privacy-preserving embedding retrieval module that allows users to download relevant embeddings from the server, and (2) an update aggregation module that securely aggregates updates at the server. Empirical analysis demonstrates that SecEmb reduces both download and upload communication costs by up to 90x and decreases user-side computation time by up to 70x compared with secure FedRec protocols. Additionally, it offers non-negligible utility advantages compared with lossy message compression methods.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12453v1
"""Explain, Don't Just Warn!"" -- A Real-Time Framework for Generating   Phishing Warnings with Contextual Cues","Anti-phishing tools typically display generic warnings that offer users limited explanation on why a website is considered malicious, which can prevent end-users from developing the mental models needed to recognize phishing cues on their own. This becomes especially problematic when these tools inevitably fail - particularly against evasive threats, and users are found to be ill-equipped to identify and avoid them independently. To address these limitations, we present PhishXplain (PXP), a real-time explainable phishing warning system designed to augment existing detection mechanisms. PXP empowers users by clearly articulating why a site is flagged as malicious, highlighting suspicious elements using a memory-efficient implementation of LLaMA 3.2. It utilizes a structured two-step prompt architecture to identify phishing features, generate contextual explanations, and render annotated screenshots that visually reinforce the warning. Longitudinally implementing PhishXplain over a month on 7,091 live phishing websites, we found that it can generate warnings for 94% of the sites, with a correctness of 96%. We also evaluated PhishXplain through a user study with 150 participants split into two groups: one received conventional, generic warnings, while the other interacted with PXP's explainable alerts. Participants who received the explainable warnings not only demonstrated a significantly better understanding of phishing indicators but also achieved higher accuracy in identifying phishing threats, even without any warning. Moreover, they reported greater satisfaction and trust in the warnings themselves. These improvements were especially pronounced among users with lower initial levels of cybersecurity proficiency and awareness. To encourage the adoption of this framework, we release PhishXplain as a browser extension.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06836v2
Elevating Cyber Threat Intelligence against Disinformation Campaigns   with LLM-based Concept Extraction and the FakeCTI Dataset,"The swift spread of fake news and disinformation campaigns poses a significant threat to public trust, political stability, and cybersecurity. Traditional Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) approaches, which rely on low-level indicators such as domain names and social media handles, are easily evaded by adversaries who frequently modify their online infrastructure. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel CTI framework that focuses on high-level, semantic indicators derived from recurrent narratives and relationships of disinformation campaigns. Our approach extracts structured CTI indicators from unstructured disinformation content, capturing key entities and their contextual dependencies within fake news using Large Language Models (LLMs). We further introduce FakeCTI, the first dataset that systematically links fake news to disinformation campaigns and threat actors. To evaluate the effectiveness of our CTI framework, we analyze multiple fake news attribution techniques, spanning from traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) to fine-tuned LLMs. This work shifts the focus from low-level artifacts to persistent conceptual structures, establishing a scalable and adaptive approach to tracking and countering disinformation campaigns.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03345v1
Empc: Effective Path Prioritization for Symbolic Execution with Path   Cover,"Symbolic execution is a powerful program analysis technique that can formally reason the correctness of program behaviors and detect software bugs. It can systematically explore the execution paths of the tested program. But it suffers from an inherent limitation: path explosion. Path explosion occurs when symbolic execution encounters an overwhelming number (exponential to the program size) of paths that need to be symbolically reasoned. It severely impacts the scalability and performance of symbolic execution. To tackle this problem, previous works leverage various heuristics to prioritize paths for symbolic execution. They rank the exponential number of paths using static rules or heuristics and explore the paths with the highest rank. However, in practice, these works often fail to generalize to diverse programs. In this work, we propose a novel and effective path prioritization technique with path cover, named Empc. Our key insight is that not all paths need to be symbolically reasoned. Unlike traditional path prioritization, our approach leverages a small subset of paths as a minimum path cover (MPC) that can cover all code regions of the tested programs. To encourage diversity in path prioritization, we compute multiple MPCs. We then guide the search for symbolic execution on the small number of paths inside multiple MPCs rather than the exponential number of paths. We implement our technique Empc based on KLEE. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of Empc to investigate its performance in code coverage, bug findings, and runtime overhead. The evaluation shows that Empc can cover 19.6% more basic blocks than KLEE's best search strategy and 24.4% more lines compared to the state-of-the-art work cgs. Empc also finds 24 more security violations than KLEE's best search strategy. Meanwhile, Empc can significantly reduce the memory usage of KLEE by up to 93.5%.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03555v1
Instantiating Standards: Enabling Standard-Driven Text TTP Extraction   with Evolvable Memory,"Extracting MITRE ATT\&CK Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) from natural language threat reports is crucial yet challenging. Existing methods primarily focus on performance metrics using data-driven approaches, often neglecting mechanisms to ensure faithful adherence to the official standard. This deficiency compromises reliability and consistency of TTP assignments, creating intelligence silos and contradictory threat assessments across organizations. To address this, we introduce a novel framework that converts abstract standard definitions into actionable, contextualized knowledge. Our method utilizes Large Language Model (LLM) to generate, update, and apply this knowledge. This framework populates an evolvable memory with dual-layer situational knowledge instances derived from labeled examples and official definitions. The first layer identifies situational contexts (e.g., ""Communication with C2 using encoded subdomains""), while the second layer captures distinctive features that differentiate similar techniques (e.g., distinguishing T1132 ""Data Encoding"" from T1071 ""Application Layer Protocol"" based on whether the focus is on encoding methods or protocol usage). This structured approach provides a transparent basis for explainable TTP assignments and enhanced human oversight, while also helping to standardize other TTP extraction systems. Experiments show our framework (using Qwen2.5-32B) boosts Technique F1 scores by 11\% over GPT-4o. Qualitative analysis confirms superior standardization, enhanced transparency, and improved explainability in real-world threat intelligence scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses the LLM to generate, update, and apply the a new knowledge for TTP extraction.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09261v1
"Integrating Communication, Sensing, and Security: Progress and Prospects   of PLS in ISAC Systems","The sixth generation of wireless networks defined several key performance indicators (KPIs) for assessing its networks, mainly in terms of reliability, coverage, and sensing. In this regard, remarkable attention has been paid recently to the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm as an enabler for efficiently and jointly performing communication and sensing using the same spectrum and hardware resources. On the other hand, ensuring communication and data security has been an imperative requirement for wireless networks throughout their evolution. The physical-layer security (PLS) concept paved the way to catering to the security needs in wireless networks in a sustainable way while guaranteeing theoretically secure transmissions, independently of the computational capacity of adversaries. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to consider a balanced trade-off between communication reliability, sensing, and security in future networks, such as the 5G and beyond, and the 6G. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and system-wise review of designed secure ISAC systems from a PLS point of view. In particular, the impact of various physical-layer techniques, schemes, and wireless technologies to ensure the sensing-security trade-off is studied from the surveyed work. Furthermore, the amalgamation of PLS and ISAC is analyzed in a broader impact by considering attacks targeting data confidentiality, communication covertness, and sensing spoofing. The paper also serves as a tutorial by presenting several theoretical foundations on ISAC and PLS, which represent a practical guide for readers to develop novel secure ISAC network designs.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05090v1
Enhancing Blockchain Cross Chain Interoperability: A Comprehensive   Survey,"Blockchain technology, introduced in 2008, has revolutionized data storage and transfer across sectors such as finance, healthcare, intelligent transportation, and the metaverse. However, the proliferation of blockchain systems has led to discrepancies in architectures, consensus mechanisms, and data standards, creating data and value silos that hinder the development of an integrated multi chain ecosystem. Blockchain interoperability (a.k.a cross chain interoperability) has thus emerged as a solution to enable seamless data and asset exchange across disparate blockchains. In this survey, we systematically analyze over 150 high impact sources from academic journals, digital libraries, and grey literature to provide an in depth examination of blockchain interoperability. By exploring the existing methods, technologies, and architectures, we offer a classification of interoperability approaches including Atomic Swaps, Sidechains, Light Clients, and so on, which represent the most comprehensive overview to date. Furthermore, we investigate the convergence of academic research with industry practices, underscoring the importance of collaborative efforts in advancing blockchain innovation. Finally, we identify key strategic insights, challenges, and future research trajectories in this field.

Leakage-resilient Algebraic Manipulation Detection Codes with Optimal   Parameters,"Algebraic Manipulation Detection (AMD) codes is a cryptographic primitive that was introduced by Cramer, Dodis, Fehr, Padro and Wichs. They are keyless message authentication codes that protect messages against additive tampering by the adversary assuming that the adversary cannot ""see"" the codeword. For certain applications, it is unreasonable to assume that the adversary computes the added offset without any knowledge of the codeword c. Recently, Ahmadi and Safavi-Naini, and then Lin, Safavi-Naini, and Wang gave a construction of leakage-resilient AMD codes where the adversary has some partial information about the codeword before choosing added offset, and the scheme is secure even conditioned on this partial information. In this paper we establish bounds on the leakage rate r and the code rate k for leakage-resilient AMD codes. In particular we prove that 2r + k < 1 and for the weak case (security is averaged over a uniformly random message) r + k < 1. These bounds hold even if adversary is polynomial-time bounded, as long as we allow leakage function to be arbitrary. We present constructions of AMD codes that (asymptotically) fulfill the above bounds for almost full range of parameters r and k. This shows that the above bounds and constructions are in-fact optimal. In the last section we show that if a leakage function is computationally bounded (we use the Ideal Cipher Model) then it is possible to break these bounds.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06174v1
Enhancing IoT Cyber Attack Detection in the Presence of Highly   Imbalanced Data,"Due to the rapid growth in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) networks, the cyber risk has increased exponentially, and therefore, we have to develop effective IDS that can work well with highly imbalanced datasets. A high rate of missed threats can be the result, as traditional machine learning models tend to struggle in identifying attacks when normal data volume is much higher than the volume of attacks. For example, the dataset used in this study reveals a strong class imbalance with 94,659 instances of the majority class and only 28 instances of the minority class, making it quite challenging to determine rare attacks accurately. The challenges presented in this research are addressed by hybrid sampling techniques designed to improve data imbalance detection accuracy in IoT domains. After applying these techniques, we evaluate the performance of several machine learning models such as Random Forest, Soft Voting, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Logistic Regression with respect to the classification of cyber-attacks. The obtained results indicate that the Random Forest model achieved the best performance with a Kappa score of 0.9903, test accuracy of 0.9961, and AUC of 0.9994. Strong performance is also shown by the Soft Voting model, with an accuracy of 0.9952 and AUC of 0.9997, indicating the benefits of combining model predictions. Overall, this work demonstrates the value of hybrid sampling combined with robust model and feature selection for significantly improving IoT security against cyber-attacks, especially in highly imbalanced data environments.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10600v1
Sandcastles in the Storm: Revisiting the (Im)possibility of Strong   Watermarking,"Watermarking AI-generated text is critical for combating misuse. Yet recent theoretical work argues that any watermark can be erased via random walk attacks that perturb text while preserving quality. However, such attacks rely on two key assumptions: (1) rapid mixing (watermarks dissolve quickly under perturbations) and (2) reliable quality preservation (automated quality oracles perfectly guide edits). Through large-scale experiments and human-validated assessments, we find mixing is slow: 100% of perturbed texts retain traces of their origin after hundreds of edits, defying rapid mixing. Oracles falter, as state-of-the-art quality detectors misjudge edits (77% accuracy), compounding errors during attacks. Ultimately, attacks underperform: automated walks remove watermarks just 26% of the time -- dropping to 10% under human quality review. These findings challenge the inevitability of watermark removal. Instead, practical barriers -- slow mixing and imperfect quality control -- reveal watermarking to be far more robust than theoretical models suggest. The gap between idealized attacks and real-world feasibility underscores the need for stronger watermarking methods and more realistic attack models.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06827v1
Quantum Support Vector Regression for Robust Anomaly Detection,"Anomaly Detection (AD) is critical in data analysis, particularly within the domain of IT security. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool for AD in large-scale data. In this study, we explore the potential of quantum ML approaches, specifically quantum kernel methods, for the application to robust AD. We build upon previous work on Quantum Support Vector Regression (QSVR) for semisupervised AD by conducting a comprehensive benchmark on IBM quantum hardware using eleven datasets. Our results demonstrate that QSVR achieves strong classification performance and even outperforms the noiseless simulation on two of these datasets. Moreover, we investigate the influence of - in the NISQ-era inevitable - quantum noise on the performance of the QSVR. Our findings reveal that the model exhibits robustness to depolarizing, phase damping, phase flip, and bit flip noise, while amplitude damping and miscalibration noise prove to be more disruptive. Finally, we explore the domain of Quantum Adversarial Machine Learning and demonstrate that QSVR is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that noise does not improve the adversarial robustness of the model.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01012v2
Securing P4 Programs by Information Flow Control,"Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has transformed network architectures by decoupling the control and data-planes, enabling fine-grained control over packet processing and forwarding. P4, a language designed for programming data-plane devices, allows developers to define custom packet processing behaviors directly on programmable network devices. This provides greater control over packet forwarding, inspection, and modification. However, the increased flexibility provided by P4 also brings significant security challenges, particularly in managing sensitive data and preventing information leakage within the data-plane.   This paper presents a novel security type system for analyzing information flow in P4 programs that combines security types with interval analysis. The proposed type system allows the specification of security policies in terms of input and output packet bit fields rather than program variables. We formalize this type system and prove it sound, guaranteeing that well-typed programs satisfy noninterference. Our prototype implementation, Tap4s, is evaluated on several use cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting security violations and information leakages.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09221v1
Detecting Sybil Addresses in Blockchain Airdrops: A Subgraph-based   Feature Propagation and Fusion Approach,"Sybil attacks pose a significant security threat to blockchain ecosystems, particularly in token airdrop events. This paper proposes a novel sybil address identification method based on subgraph feature extraction lightGBM. The method first constructs a two-layer deep transaction subgraph for each address, then extracts key event operation features according to the lifecycle of sybil addresses, including the time of first transaction, first gas acquisition, participation in airdrop activities, and last transaction. These temporal features effectively capture the consistency of sybil address behavior operations. Additionally, the method extracts amount and network structure features, comprehensively describing address behavior patterns and network topology through feature propagation and fusion. Experiments conducted on a dataset containing 193,701 addresses (including 23,240 sybil addresses) show that this method outperforms existing approaches in terms of precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC, with all metrics exceeding 0.9. The methods and results of this study can be further applied to broader blockchain security areas such as transaction manipulation identification and token liquidity risk assessment, contributing to the construction of a more secure and fair blockchain ecosystem.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09313v1
Sponge Attacks on Sensing AI: Energy-Latency Vulnerabilities and Defense   via Model Pruning,"Recent studies have shown that sponge attacks can significantly increase the energy consumption and inference latency of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, prior work has focused primarily on computer vision and natural language processing tasks, overlooking the growing use of lightweight AI models in sensing-based applications on resource-constrained devices, such as those in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. These attacks pose serious threats of energy depletion and latency degradation in systems where limited battery capacity and real-time responsiveness are critical for reliable operation. This paper makes two key contributions. First, we present the first systematic exploration of energy-latency sponge attacks targeting sensing-based AI models. Using wearable sensing-based AI as a case study, we demonstrate that sponge attacks can substantially degrade performance by increasing energy consumption, leading to faster battery drain, and by prolonging inference latency. Second, to mitigate such attacks, we investigate model pruning, a widely adopted compression technique for resource-constrained AI, as a potential defense. Our experiments show that pruning-induced sparsity significantly improves model resilience against sponge poisoning. We also quantify the trade-offs between model efficiency and attack resilience, offering insights into the security implications of model compression in sensing-based AI systems deployed in IoT environments.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06454v1
Advancing Email Spam Detection: Leveraging Zero-Shot Learning and Large   Language Models,"Email spam detection is a critical task in modern communication systems, essential for maintaining productivity, security, and user experience. Traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches, while effective in static settings, face significant limitations in adapting to evolving spam tactics, addressing class imbalance, and managing data scarcity. These challenges necessitate innovative approaches that reduce dependency on extensive labeled datasets and frequent retraining. This study investigates the effectiveness of Zero-Shot Learning using FLAN-T5, combined with advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as BERT for email spam detection. By employing BERT to preprocess and extract critical information from email content, and FLAN-T5 to classify emails in a Zero-Shot framework, the proposed approach aims to address the limitations of traditional spam detection systems. The integration of FLAN-T5 and BERT enables robust spam detection without relying on extensive labeled datasets or frequent retraining, making it highly adaptable to unseen spam patterns and adversarial environments. This research highlights the potential of leveraging zero-shot learning and NLPs for scalable and efficient spam detection, providing insights into their capability to address the dynamic and challenging nature of spam detection tasks.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02362v1
Bridging Expertise Gaps: The Role of LLMs in Human-AI Collaboration for   Cybersecurity,"This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can function as intelligent collaborators to bridge expertise gaps in cybersecurity decision-making. We examine two representative tasks-phishing email detection and intrusion detection-that differ in data modality, cognitive complexity, and user familiarity. Through a controlled mixed-methods user study, n = 58 (phishing, n = 34; intrusion, n = 24), we find that human-AI collaboration improves task performance,reducing false positives in phishing detection and false negatives in intrusion detection. A learning effect is also observed when participants transition from collaboration to independent work, suggesting that LLMs can support long-term skill development. Our qualitative analysis shows that interaction dynamics-such as LLM definitiveness, explanation style, and tone-influence user trust, prompting strategies, and decision revision. Users engaged in more analytic questioning and showed greater reliance on LLM feedback in high-complexity settings. These results provide design guidance for building interpretable, adaptive, and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems, and demonstrate that LLMs can meaningfully support non-experts in reasoning through complex cybersecurity problems.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03179v1

The tabulations contain statistics of counts of U.S. persons living in certain types of households, including averages. The article describes the PHSafe algorithm, which is based on adding noise drawn from a discrete Gaussian distribution to the statistics of interest. We prove that the algorithm satisfies a well-studied variant of differential privacy, called zero-concentrated differential privacy.

Development of an Adapter for Analyzing and Protecting Machine Learning   Models from Competitive Activity in the Networks Services,"Due to the increasing number of tasks that are solved on remote servers, identifying and classifying traffic is an important task to reduce the load on the server.

However, such ML models are also subject to attacks that affect the classification result of network traffic. To protect models, we proposed a solution based on an autoencoder",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01460v1
Information Leakage in Data Linkage,"The process of linking databases that contain sensitive information about individuals across organisations is an increasingly common requirement in the health and social science research domains, as well as with governments and businesses. To protect personal data, protocols have been developed to limit the leakage of sensitive information. Furthermore, privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) techniques have been proposed to conduct linkage on encoded data. While PPRL techniques are now being employed in real-world applications, the focus of PPRL research has been on the technical aspects of linking sensitive data (such as encoding methods and cryptanalysis attacks), but not on organisational challenges when employing such techniques in practice. We analyse what sensitive information can possibly leak, either unintentionally or intentionally, in traditional data linkage as well as PPRL protocols, and what a party that participates in such a protocol can learn from the data it obtains legitimately within the protocol. We also show that PPRL protocols can still result in the unintentional leakage of sensitive information. We provide recommendations to help data custodians and other parties involved in a data linkage project to identify and prevent vulnerabilities and make their project more secure.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08596v1
Analysis of the vulnerability of machine learning regression models to   adversarial attacks using data from 5G wireless networks,"This article describes the process of creating a script and conducting an analytical study of a dataset using the DeepMIMO emulator. An advertorial attack was carried out using the FGSM method to maximize the gradient. A comparison is made of the effectiveness of binary classifiers in the task of detecting distorted data. The dynamics of changes in the quality indicators of the regression model were analyzed in conditions without adversarial attacks, during an adversarial attack and when the distorted data was isolated. It is shown that an adversarial FGSM attack with gradient maximization leads to an increase in the value of the MSE metric by 33% and a decrease in the R2 indicator by 10% on average. The LightGBM binary classifier effectively identifies data with adversarial anomalies with 98% accuracy. Regression machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, but rapid analysis of network traffic and data transmitted over the network makes it possible to identify malicious activity",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00487v1
On the Account Security Risks Posed by Password Strength Meters,"Password strength meters (PSMs) have been widely used by websites to gauge password strength, encouraging users to create stronger passwords. Popular data-driven PSMs, e.g., based on Markov, Probabilistic Context-free Grammar (PCFG) and neural networks, alarm strength based on a model learned from real passwords. Despite their proven effectiveness, the secure utility that arises from the leakage of trained passwords remains largely overlooked. To address this gap, we analyze 11 PSMs and find that 5 data-driven meters are vulnerable to membership inference attacks that expose their trained passwords, and seriously, 3 rule-based meters openly disclose their blocked passwords. We specifically design a PSM privacy leakage evaluation approach, and uncover that a series of general data-driven meters are vulnerable to leaking between 10^4 to 10^5 trained passwords, with the PCFG-based models being more vulnerable than other counterparts; furthermore, we aid in deriving insights that the inherent utility-privacy tradeoff is not as severe as previously thought. To further exploit the risks, we develop novel meter-aware attacks when a clever attacker can filter the used passwords during compromising accounts on websites using the meter, and experimentally show that attackers targeting websites that deployed the popular Zxcvbn meter can compromise an additional 5.84% user accounts within 10 attempts, demonstrating the urgent need for privacy-preserving PSMs that protect the confidentiality of the meter's used passwords. Finally, we sketch some counter-measures to mitigate these threats.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08292v1
Blockchain-Enabled Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Group Purchasing for   Energy Plans,"Retail energy markets are increasingly consumer-oriented, thanks to a growing number of energy plans offered by a plethora of energy suppliers, retailers and intermediaries. To maximize the benefits of competitive retail energy markets, group purchasing is an emerging paradigm that aggregates consumers' purchasing power by coordinating switch decisions to specific energy providers for discounted energy plans. Traditionally, group purchasing is mediated by a trusted third-party, which suffers from the lack of privacy and transparency. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm of decentralized privacy-preserving group purchasing, empowered by privacy-preserving blockchain and secure multi-party computation, to enable users to form a coalition for coordinated switch decisions in a decentralized manner, without a trusted third-party. The coordinated switch decisions are determined by a competitive online algorithm, based on users' private consumption data and current energy plan tariffs. Remarkably, no private user consumption data will be revealed to others in the online decision-making process, which is carried out in a transparently verifiable manner to eliminate frauds from dishonest users and supports fair mutual compensations by sharing the switching costs to incentivize group purchasing. We implemented our decentralized group purchasing solution as a smart contract on Solidity-supported blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum), and provide extensive empirical evaluation.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11094v1
Comet: Accelerating Private Inference for Large Language Model by   Predicting Activation Sparsity,"With the growing use of large language models (LLMs) hosted on cloud platforms to offer inference services, privacy concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive information are escalating. Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is a promising solution to protect the privacy in LLM inference. However, MPC requires frequent inter-server communication, causing high performance overhead.   Inspired by the prevalent activation sparsity of LLMs, where most neuron are not activated after non-linear activation functions, we propose an efficient private inference system, Comet. This system employs an accurate and fast predictor to predict the sparsity distribution of activation function output. Additionally, we introduce a new private inference protocol. It efficiently and securely avoids computations involving zero values by exploiting the spatial locality of the predicted sparse distribution. While this computation-avoidance approach impacts the spatiotemporal continuity of KV cache entries, we address this challenge with a low-communication overhead cache refilling strategy that merges miss requests and incorporates a prefetching mechanism. Finally, we evaluate Comet on four common LLMs and compare it with six state-of-the-art private inference systems. Comet achieves a 1.87x-2.63x speedup and a 1.94x-2.64x communication reduction.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07239v1

Duality on the Thermodynamics of the Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN)   Secure Key Exchange Scheme,"This study investigates a duality approach to information leak detection in the generalized Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN) secure key exchange scheme. While previous work by Chamon and Kish sampled voltages at zero-current instances, this research explores sampling currents at zero-voltage crossings. The objective is to determine if this dual approach can reveal information leaks in non-equilibrium KLJN systems. Results indicate that the duality method successfully detects information leaks, further supporting the necessity of thermal equilibrium for unconditional security in KLJN systems.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00858v1
GoLeash: Mitigating Golang Software Supply Chain Attacks with Runtime   Policy Enforcement,"Modern software supply chain attacks consist of introducing new, malicious capabilities into trusted third-party software components, in order to propagate to a victim through a package dependency chain. These attacks are especially concerning for the Go language ecosystem, which is extensively used in critical cloud infrastructures. We present GoLeash, a novel system that applies the principle of least privilege at the package-level granularity, by enforcing distinct security policies for each package in the supply chain. This finer granularity enables GoLeash to detect malicious packages more precisely than traditional sandboxing that handles security policies at process- or container-level. Moreover, GoLeash remains effective under obfuscation, can overcome the limitations of static analysis, and incurs acceptable runtime overhead.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11016v1
AttentionGuard: Transformer-based Misbehavior Detection for Secure   Vehicular Platoons,"Vehicle platooning, with vehicles traveling in close formation coordinated through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, offers significant benefits in fuel efficiency and road utilization. However, it is vulnerable to sophisticated falsification attacks by authenticated insiders that can destabilize the formation and potentially cause catastrophic collisions. This paper addresses this challenge: misbehavior detection in vehicle platooning systems. We present AttentionGuard, a transformer-based framework for misbehavior detection that leverages the self-attention mechanism to identify anomalous patterns in mobility data. Our proposal employs a multi-head transformer-encoder to process sequential kinematic information, enabling effective differentiation between normal mobility patterns and falsification attacks across diverse platooning scenarios, including steady-state (no-maneuver) operation, join, and exit maneuvers. Our evaluation uses an extensive simulation dataset featuring various attack vectors (constant, gradual, and combined falsifications) and operational parameters (controller types, vehicle speeds, and attacker positions). Experimental results demonstrate that AttentionGuard achieves up to 0.95 F1-score in attack detection, with robust performance maintained during complex maneuvers. Notably, our system performs effectively with minimal latency (100ms decision intervals), making it suitable for real-time transportation safety applications. Comparative analysis reveals superior detection capabilities and establishes the transformer-encoder as a promising approach for securing Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) against sophisticated insider threats.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10273v1
HoneyWin: High-Interaction Windows Honeypot in Enterprise Environment,"Windows operating systems (OS) are ubiquitous in enterprise Information Technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) environments. Due to their widespread adoption and known vulnerabilities, they are often the primary targets of malware and ransomware attacks. With 93% of the ransomware targeting Windows-based systems, there is an urgent need for advanced defensive mechanisms to detect, analyze, and mitigate threats effectively. In this paper, we propose HoneyWin a high-interaction Windows honeypot that mimics an enterprise IT environment. The HoneyWin consists of three Windows 11 endpoints and an enterprise-grade gateway provisioned with comprehensive network traffic capturing, host-based logging, deceptive tokens, endpoint security and real-time alerts capabilities. The HoneyWin has been deployed live in the wild for 34 days and receives more than 5.79 million unsolicited connections, 1.24 million login attempts, 5 and 354 successful logins via remote desktop protocol (RDP) and secure shell (SSH) respectively. The adversary interacted with the deceptive token in one of the RDP sessions and exploited the public-facing endpoint to initiate the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) brute-force bot attack via SSH sessions. The adversary successfully harvested 1,250 SMTP credentials after attempting 151,179 credentials during the attack.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00465v1
FedTDP: A Privacy-Preserving and Unified Framework for Trajectory Data   Preparation via Federated Learning,"Trajectory data, which capture the movement patterns of people and vehicles over time and space, are crucial for applications like traffic optimization and urban planning. However, issues such as noise and incompleteness often compromise data quality, leading to inaccurate trajectory analyses and limiting the potential of these applications. While Trajectory Data Preparation (TDP) can enhance data quality, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) they do not address data privacy concerns, particularly in federated settings where trajectory data sharing is prohibited, and (ii) they typically design task-specific models that lack generalizability across diverse TDP scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose FedTDP, a privacy-preserving and unified framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for TDP in federated environments. Specifically, we: (i) design a trajectory privacy autoencoder to secure data transmission and protect privacy, (ii) introduce a trajectory knowledge enhancer to improve model learning of TDP-related knowledge, enabling the development of TDP-oriented LLMs, and (iii) propose federated parallel optimization to enhance training efficiency by reducing data transmission and enabling parallel model training. Experiments on 6 real datasets and 10 mainstream TDP tasks demonstrate that FedTDP consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05155v1
"AI-Driven Security in Cloud Computing: Enhancing Threat Detection,   Automated Response, and Cyber Resilience","Cloud security concerns have been greatly realized in recent years due to the increase of complicated threats in the computing world. Many traditional solutions do not work well in real-time to detect or prevent more complex threats. Artificial intelligence is today regarded as a revolution in determining a protection plan for cloud data architecture through machine learning, statistical visualization of computing infrastructure, and detection of security breaches followed by counteraction. These AI-enabled systems make work easier as more network activities are scrutinized, and any anomalous behavior that might be a precursor to a more serious breach is prevented. This paper examines ways AI can enhance cloud security by applying predictive analytics, behavior-based security threat detection, and AI-stirring encryption. It also outlines the problems of the previous security models and how AI overcomes them. For a similar reason, issues like data privacy, biases in the AI model, and regulatory compliance are also covered. So, AI improves the protection of cloud computing contexts; however, more efforts are needed in the subsequent phases to extend the technology's reliability, modularity, and ethical aspects. This means that AI can be blended with other new computing technologies, including blockchain, to improve security frameworks further. The paper discusses the current trends in securing cloud data architecture using AI and presents further research and application directions.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03945v1
AutoRAN: Weak-to-Strong Jailbreaking of Large Reasoning Models,"This paper presents AutoRAN, the first automated, weak-to-strong jailbreak attack framework targeting large reasoning models (LRMs). At its core, AutoRAN leverages a weak, less-aligned reasoning model to simulate the target model's high-level reasoning structures, generates narrative prompts, and iteratively refines candidate prompts by incorporating the target model's intermediate reasoning steps. We evaluate AutoRAN against state-of-the-art LRMs including GPT-o3/o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash across multiple benchmark datasets (AdvBench, HarmBench, and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that AutoRAN achieves remarkable success rates (approaching 100%) within one or a few turns across different LRMs, even when judged by a robustly aligned external model. This work reveals that leveraging weak reasoning models can effectively exploit the critical vulnerabilities of much more capable reasoning models, highlighting the need for improved safety measures specifically designed for reasoning-based models.

Performance Analysis and Deployment Considerations of Post-Quantum   Cryptography for Consumer Electronics,"Quantum computing threatens the security foundations of consumer electronics (CE). Preparing the diverse CE ecosystem, particularly resource-constrained devices, for the post-quantum era requires quantitative understanding of quantum-resistant cryptography (PQC) performance. This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform performance analysis of leading PQC Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) and digital signatures (NIST standards/candidates) compared against classical RSA/ECC. We evaluated execution time, communication costs (key/signature sizes), and memory footprint indicators on high-performance (macOS/M4, Ubuntu/x86) and constrained platforms (Raspberry Pi 4/ARM). Our quantitative results reveal lattice-based schemes, notably NIST standards ML-KEM (Kyber) and ML-DSA (Dilithium), provide a strong balance of computational efficiency and moderate communication/storage overhead, making them highly suitable for many CE applications. In contrast, code-based Classic McEliece imposes significant key size challenges, while hash-based SPHINCS+ offers high security assurance but demands large signature sizes impacting bandwidth and storage. Based on empirical data across platforms and security levels, we provide specific deployment recommendations tailored to different CE scenarios (e.g., wearables, smart home hubs, mobile devices), offering guidance for manufacturers navigating the PQC transition.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02239v1
Managerial Insights on Investment Strategy in Cybersecurity: Findings   from Multi-Country Research,"This study examines the strategic role of cybersecurity based on survey data from 1,083 managers across Europe, the UK, and the United States.

An Efficient Hybrid Key Exchange Mechanism,"We present \textsc{CHOKE}, a novel code-based hybrid key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) designed to securely and efficiently transmit multiple session keys simultaneously. By encoding $n$ independent session keys with an individually secure linear code and encapsulating each resulting coded symbol using a separate KEM, \textsc{CHOKE} achieves computational individual security -- each key remains secure as long as at least one underlying KEM remains unbroken.

Modeling Behavioral Preferences of Cyber Adversaries Using Inverse   Reinforcement Learning,"This paper presents a holistic approach to attacker preference modeling from system-level audit logs using inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Adversary modeling is an important capability in cybersecurity that lets defenders characterize behaviors of potential attackers, which enables attribution to known cyber adversary groups. Existing approaches rely on documenting an ever-evolving set of attacker tools and techniques to track known threat actors. Although attacks evolve constantly, attacker behavioral preferences are intrinsic and less volatile. Our approach learns the behavioral preferences of cyber adversaries from forensics data on their tools and techniques. We model the attacker as an expert decision-making agent with unknown behavioral preferences situated in a computer host. We leverage attack provenance graphs of audit logs to derive a state-action trajectory of the attack. We test our approach on open datasets of audit logs containing real attack data. Our results demonstrate for the first time that low-level forensics data can automatically reveal an adversary's subjective preferences, which serves as an additional dimension to modeling and documenting cyber adversaries. Attackers' preferences tend to be invariant despite their different tools and indicate predispositions that are inherent to the attacker. As such, these inferred preferences can potentially serve as unique behavioral signatures of attackers and improve threat attribution.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03817v1
NCorr-FP: A Neighbourhood-based Correlation-preserving Fingerprinting   Scheme for Intellectual Property Protection of Structured Data,"Ensuring data ownership and traceability of unauthorised redistribution are central to safeguarding intellectual property in shared data environments. Data fingerprinting addresses these challenges by embedding recipient-specific marks into the data, typically via content modifications. We propose NCorr-FP, a Neighbourhood-based Correlation-preserving Fingerprinting system for structured tabular data with the main goal of preserving statistical fidelity. The method uses local record similarity and density estimation to guide the insertion of fingerprint bits. The embedding logic is then reversed to extract the fingerprint from a potentially modified dataset. Extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness, fidelity, utility and robustness. Results show that fingerprints are virtually imperceptible, with minute Hellinger distances and KL divergences, even at high embedding ratios. The system also maintains high data utility for downstream predictive tasks. The method achieves 100\% detection confidence under substantial data deletions and remains robust against adaptive and collusion attacks. Satisfying all these requirements concurrently on mixed-type datasets highlights the strong applicability of NCorr-FP to real-world data settings.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06379v1
AES-RV: Hardware-Efficient RISC-V Accelerator with Low-Latency AES   Instruction Extension for IoT Security,"The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely adopted cryptographic algorithm essential for securing embedded systems and IoT platforms. However, existing AES hardware accelerators often face limitations in performance, energy efficiency, and flexibility. This paper presents AES-RV, a hardware-efficient RISC-V accelerator featuring low-latency AES instruction extensions optimized for real-time processing across all AES modes and key sizes. AES-RV integrates three key innovations: high-bandwidth internal buffers for continuous data processing, a specialized AES unit with custom low-latency instructions, and a pipelined system supported by a ping-pong memory transfer mechanism. Implemented on the Xilinx ZCU102 SoC FPGA, AES-RV achieves up to 255.97 times speedup and up to 453.04 times higher energy efficiency compared to baseline and conventional CPU/GPU platforms. It also demonstrates superior throughput and area efficiency against state-of-the-art AES accelerators, making it a strong candidate for secure and high-performance embedded systems.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11880v1
Energy-Efficient NTT Sampler for Kyber Benchmarked on FPGA,"Kyber is a lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism selected for standardization by the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) project. A critical component of Kyber's key generation process is the sampling of matrix elements from a uniform distribution over the ring Rq . This step is one of the most computationally intensive tasks in the scheme, significantly impacting performance in low-power embedded systems such as Internet of Things (IoT), wearable devices, wireless sensor networks (WSNs), smart cards, TPMs (Trusted Platform Modules), etc. Existing approaches to this sampling, notably conventional SampleNTT and Parse-SPDM3, rely on rejection sampling. Both algorithms require a large number of random bytes, which needs at least three SHAKE-128 squeezing steps per polynomial. As a result, it causes significant amount of latency and energy. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient sampling algorithm, namely Modified SampleNTT, which substantially educes the average number of bits required from SHAKE-128 to generate elements in Rq - achieving approximately a 33% reduction compared to conventional SampleNTT. Modified SampleNTT achieves 99.16% success in generating a complete polynomial using only two SHAKE-128 squeezes, outperforming both state-of-the-art methods, which never succeed in two squeezes of SHAKE-128. Furthermore, our algorithm maintains the same average rejection rate as existing techniques and passes all standard statistical tests for randomness quality. FPGA implementation on Artix-7 demonstrates a 33.14% reduction in energy, 33.32% lower latency, and 0.28% fewer slices compared to SampleNTT. Our results confirm that Modified SampleNTT is an efficient and practical alternative for uniform polynomial sampling in PQC schemes such as Kyber, especially for low-power security processors.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01782v1
A study on audio synchronous steganography detection and distributed   guide inference model based on sliding spectral features and intelligent   inference drive,"With the rise of short video platforms in global communication, embedding steganographic data in audio synchronization streams has emerged as a new covert communication method. To address the limitations of traditional techniques in detecting synchronized steganography, this paper proposes a detection and distributed guidance reconstruction model based on short video ""Yupan"" samples released by China's South Sea Fleet on TikTok. The method integrates sliding spectrum feature extraction and intelligent inference mechanisms. A 25 ms sliding window with short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used to extract the main frequency trajectory and construct the synchronization frame detection model (M1), identifying a frame flag ""FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF80"". The subsequent 32-byte payload is decoded by a structured model (M2) to infer distributed guidance commands. Analysis reveals a low-entropy, repetitive byte sequence in the 36 to 45 second audio segment with highly concentrated spectral energy, confirming the presence of synchronization frames. Although plaintext semantics are not restored, the consistency in command field layout suggests features of military communication protocols. The multi-segment splicing model further shows cross-video embedding and centralized decoding capabilities. The proposed framework validates the effectiveness of sliding spectral features for synchronized steganography detection and builds an extensible inference model for covert communication analysis and tactical guidance simulation on open platforms.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03193v1
Evaluating the Robustness of Adversarial Defenses in Malware Detection   Systems,"Machine learning is a key tool for Android malware detection, effectively identifying malicious patterns in apps. However, ML-based detectors are vulnerable to evasion attacks, where small, crafted changes bypass detection. Despite progress in adversarial defenses, the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks in binary-constrained domains limits understanding of their robustness. We introduce two key contributions. First, Prioritized Binary Rounding, a technique to convert continuous perturbations into binary feature spaces while preserving high attack success and low perturbation size. Second, the sigma-binary attack, a novel adversarial method for binary domains, designed to achieve attack goals with minimal feature changes. Experiments on the Malscan dataset show that sigma-binary outperforms existing attacks and exposes key vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art defenses. Defenses equipped with adversary detectors, such as KDE, DLA, DNN+, and ICNN, exhibit significant brittleness, with attack success rates exceeding 90% using fewer than 10 feature modifications and reaching 100% with just 20. Adversarially trained defenses, including AT-rFGSM-k, AT-MaxMA, improves robustness under small budgets but remains vulnerable to unrestricted perturbations, with attack success rates of 99.45% and 96.62%, respectively. Although PAD-SMA demonstrates strong robustness against state-of-the-art gradient-based adversarial attacks by maintaining an attack success rate below 16.55%, the sigma-binary attack significantly outperforms these methods, achieving a 94.56% success rate under unrestricted perturbations. These findings highlight the critical need for precise method like sigma-binary to expose hidden vulnerabilities in existing defenses and support the development of more resilient malware detection systems.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09342v1
LlamaFirewall: An open source guardrail system for building secure AI   agents,"Large language models (LLMs) have evolved from simple chatbots into autonomous agents capable of performing complex tasks such as editing production code, orchestrating workflows, and taking higher-stakes actions based on untrusted inputs like webpages and emails. These capabilities introduce new security risks that existing security measures, such as model fine-tuning or chatbot-focused guardrails, do not fully address. Given the higher stakes and the absence of deterministic solutions to mitigate these risks, there is a critical need for a real-time guardrail monitor to serve as a final layer of defense, and support system level, use case specific safety policy definition and enforcement. We introduce LlamaFirewall, an open-source security focused guardrail framework designed to serve as a final layer of defense against security risks associated with AI Agents. Our framework mitigates risks such as prompt injection, agent misalignment, and insecure code risks through three powerful guardrails: PromptGuard 2, a universal jailbreak detector that demonstrates clear state of the art performance; Agent Alignment Checks, a chain-of-thought auditor that inspects agent reasoning for prompt injection and goal misalignment, which, while still experimental, shows stronger efficacy at preventing indirect injections in general scenarios than previously proposed approaches; and CodeShield, an online static analysis engine that is both fast and extensible, aimed at preventing the generation of insecure or dangerous code by coding agents. Additionally, we include easy-to-use customizable scanners that make it possible for any developer who can write a regular expression or an LLM prompt to quickly update an agent's security guardrails.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03574v1
Anti-Sensing: Defense against Unauthorized Radar-based Human Vital Sign   Sensing with Physically Realizable Wearable Oscillators,"Recent advancements in Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radar technology have enabled contactless, non-line-of-sight vital sign monitoring, making it a valuable tool for healthcare. However, UWB radar's ability to capture sensitive physiological data, even through walls, raises significant privacy concerns, particularly in human-robot interactions and autonomous systems that rely on radar for sensing human presence and physiological functions. In this paper, we present Anti-Sensing, a novel defense mechanism designed to prevent unauthorized radar-based sensing. Our approach introduces physically realizable perturbations, such as oscillatory motion from wearable devices, to disrupt radar sensing by mimicking natural cardiac motion, thereby misleading heart rate (HR) estimations. We develop a gradient-based algorithm to optimize the frequency and spatial amplitude of these oscillations for maximal disruption while ensuring physiological plausibility. Through both simulations and real-world experiments with radar data and neural network-based HR sensing models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Anti-Sensing in significantly degrading model accuracy, offering a practical solution for privacy preservation.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10864v1
An Automated Blackbox Noncompliance Checker for QUIC Server   Implementations,"We develop QUICtester, an automated approach for uncovering non-compliant behaviors in the ratified QUIC protocol implementations (RFC 9000/9001). QUICtester leverages active automata learning to abstract the behavior of a QUIC implementation into a finite state machine (FSM) representation. Unlike prior noncompliance checking methods, to help uncover state dependencies on event timing, QUICtester introduces the idea of state learning with event timing variations, adopting both valid and invalid input configurations, and combinations of security and transport layer parameters during learning. We use pairwise differential analysis of learned behaviour models of tested QUIC implementations to identify non-compliance instances as behaviour deviations in a property-agnostic way. This exploits the existence of the many different QUIC implementations, removing the need for validated, formal models. The diverse implementations act as cross-checking test oracles to discover non-compliance. We used QUICtester to analyze analyze 186 learned models from 19 QUIC implementations under the five security settings and discovered 55 implementation errors. Significantly, the tool uncovered a QUIC specification ambiguity resulting in an easily exploitable DoS vulnerability, led to 5 CVE assignments from developers, and two bug bounties thus far.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12690v1
An LLM-based Self-Evolving Security Framework for 6G Space-Air-Ground   Integrated Networks,"Recently emerged 6G space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), which integrate satellites, aerial networks, and terrestrial communications, offer ubiquitous coverage for various mobile applications. However, the highly dynamic, open, and heterogeneous nature of SAGINs poses severe security issues. Forming a defense line of SAGINs suffers from two preliminary challenges: 1) accurately understanding massive unstructured multi-dimensional threat information to generate defense strategies against various malicious attacks, 2) rapidly adapting to potential unknown threats to yield more effective security strategies. To tackle the above two challenges, we propose a novel security framework for SAGINs based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which consists of two key ingredients LLM-6GNG and 6G-INST. Our proposed LLM-6GNG leverages refined chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and dynamic multi-agent mechanisms to analyze massive unstructured multi-dimensional threat data and generate comprehensive security strategies, thus addressing the first challenge. Our proposed 6G-INST relies on a novel self-evolving method to automatically update LLM-6GNG, enabling it to accommodate unknown threats under dynamic communication environments, thereby addressing the second challenge. Additionally, we prototype the proposed framework with ns-3, OpenAirInterface (OAI), and software-defined radio (SDR). Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. The results show that our framework produces highly accurate security strategies that remain robust against a variety of unknown attacks. We will release our code to contribute to the community.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03161v2
On the Security Risks of ML-based Malware Detection Systems: A Survey,"Malware presents a persistent threat to user privacy and data integrity. To combat this, machine learning-based (ML-based) malware detection (MD) systems have been developed. However, these systems have increasingly been attacked in recent years, undermining their effectiveness in practice. While the security risks associated with ML-based MD systems have garnered considerable attention, the majority of prior works is limited to adversarial malware examples, lacking a comprehensive analysis of practical security risks. This paper addresses this gap by utilizing the CIA principles to define the scope of security risks. We then deconstruct ML-based MD systems into distinct operational stages, thus developing a stage-based taxonomy. Utilizing this taxonomy, we summarize the technical progress and discuss the gaps in the attack and defense proposals related to the ML-based MD systems within each stage. Subsequently, we conduct two case studies, using both inter-stage and intra-stage analyses according to the stage-based taxonomy to provide new empirical insights. Based on these analyses and insights, we suggest potential future directions from both inter-stage and intra-stage perspectives.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10903v1
MPMA: Preference Manipulation Attack Against Model Context Protocol,"Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes interface mapping for large language models (LLMs) to access external data and tools, which revolutionizes the paradigm of tool selection and facilitates the rapid expansion of the LLM agent tool ecosystem. However, as the MCP is increasingly adopted, third-party customized versions of the MCP server expose potential security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we first introduce a novel security threat, which we term the MCP Preference Manipulation Attack (MPMA). An attacker deploys a customized MCP server to manipulate LLMs, causing them to prioritize it over other competing MCP servers. This can result in economic benefits for attackers, such as revenue from paid MCP services or advertising income generated from free servers. To achieve MPMA, we first design a Direct Preference Manipulation Attack ($\mathtt{DPMA}$) that achieves significant effectiveness by inserting the manipulative word and phrases into the tool name and description. However, such a direct modification is obvious to users and lacks stealthiness. To address these limitations, we further propose Genetic-based Advertising Preference Manipulation Attack ($\mathtt{GAPMA}$). $\mathtt{GAPMA}$ employs four commonly used strategies to initialize descriptions and integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to enhance stealthiness. The experiment results demonstrate that $\mathtt{GAPMA}$ balances high effectiveness and stealthiness. Our study reveals a critical vulnerability of the MCP in open ecosystems, highlighting an urgent need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure the fairness of the MCP ecosystem.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11154v1
A Survey of Learning-Based Intrusion Detection Systems for In-Vehicle   Network,"Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) enhance mobility but face cybersecurity threats, particularly through the insecure Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Cyberattacks can have devastating consequences in connected vehicles, including the loss of control over critical systems, necessitating robust security solutions. In-vehicle Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) offer a promising approach by detecting malicious activities in real time. This survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research on learning-based in-vehicle IDSs, focusing on Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Federated Learning (FL) approaches. Based on the reviewed studies, we critically examine existing IDS approaches, categorising them by the types of attacks they detect - known, unknown, and combined known-unknown attacks - while identifying their limitations. We also review the evaluation metrics used in research, emphasising the need to consider multiple criteria to meet the requirements of safety-critical systems. Additionally, we analyse FL-based IDSs and highlight their limitations. By doing so, this survey helps identify effective security measures, address existing limitations, and guide future research toward more resilient and adaptive protection mechanisms, ensuring the safety and reliability of CAVs.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11551v1
HoneyBee: Efficient Role-based Access Control for Vector Databases via   Dynamic Partitioning,"As vector databases gain traction in enterprise applications, robust access control has become critical to safeguard sensitive data. Access control in these systems is often implemented through hybrid vector queries, which combine nearest neighbor search on vector data with relational predicates based on user permissions. However, existing approaches face significant trade-offs: creating dedicated indexes for each user minimizes query latency but introduces excessive storage redundancy, while building a single index and applying access control after vector search reduces storage overhead but suffers from poor recall and increased query latency. This paper introduces HoneyBee, a dynamic partitioning framework that bridges the gap between these approaches by leveraging the structure of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies. RBAC, widely adopted in enterprise settings, groups users into roles and assigns permissions to those roles, creating a natural ""thin waist"" in the permission structure that is ideal for partitioning decisions. Specifically, HoneyBee produces overlapping partitions where vectors can be strategically replicated across different partitions to reduce query latency while controlling storage overhead. By introducing analytical models for the performance and recall of the vector search, HoneyBee formulates the partitioning strategy as a constrained optimization problem to dynamically balance storage, query efficiency, and recall. Evaluations on RBAC workloads demonstrate that HoneyBee reduces storage redundancy compared to role partitioning and achieves up to 6x faster query speeds than row-level security (RLS) with only 1.4x storage increase, offering a practical middle ground for secure and efficient vector search.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01538v1
Enhanced Outsourced and Secure Inference for Tall Sparse Decision Trees,"A decision tree is an easy-to-understand tool that has been widely used for classification tasks. On the one hand, due to privacy concerns, there has been an urgent need to create privacy-preserving classifiers that conceal the user's input from the classifier. On the other hand, with the rise of cloud computing, data owners are keen to reduce risk by outsourcing their model, but want security guarantees that third parties cannot steal their decision tree model. To address these issues, Joye and Salehi introduced a theoretical protocol that efficiently evaluates decision trees while maintaining privacy by leveraging their comparison protocol that is resistant to timing attacks. However, their approach was not only inefficient but also prone to side-channel attacks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new decision tree inference protocol in which the model is shared and evaluated among multiple entities. We partition our decision tree model by each level to be stored in a new entity we refer to as a ""level-site."" Utilizing this approach, we were able to gain improved average run time for classifier evaluation for a non-complete tree, while also having strong mitigations against side-channel attacks.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02224v1
"RiM: Record, Improve and Maintain Physical Well-being using Federated   Learning","In academic settings, the demanding environment often forces students to prioritize academic performance over their physical well-being. Moreover, privacy concerns and the inherent risk of data breaches hinder the deployment of traditional machine learning techniques for addressing these health challenges. In this study, we introduce RiM: Record, Improve, and Maintain, a mobile application which incorporates a novel personalized machine learning framework that leverages federated learning to enhance students' physical well-being by analyzing their lifestyle habits. Our approach involves pre-training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model on a large-scale simulated dataset to generate personalized recommendations. Subsequently, we employ federated learning to fine-tune the model using data from IISER Bhopal students, thereby ensuring its applicability in real-world scenarios. The federated learning approach guarantees differential privacy by exclusively sharing model weights rather than raw data. Experimental results show that the FedAvg-based RiM model achieves an average accuracy of 60.71% and a mean absolute error of 0.91--outperforming the FedPer variant (average accuracy 46.34%, MAE 1.19)--thereby demonstrating its efficacy in predicting lifestyle deficits under privacy-preserving constraints.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06384v1
From Trade-off to Synergy: A Versatile Symbiotic Watermarking Framework   for Large Language Models,"The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened concerns about the misuse of AI-generated text, making watermarking a promising solution. Mainstream watermarking schemes for LLMs fall into two categories: logits-based and sampling-based. However, current schemes entail trade-offs among robustness, text quality, and security. To mitigate this, we integrate logits-based and sampling-based schemes, harnessing their respective strengths to achieve synergy. In this paper, we propose a versatile symbiotic watermarking framework with three strategies: serial, parallel, and hybrid. The hybrid framework adaptively embeds watermarks using token entropy and semantic entropy, optimizing the balance between detectability, robustness, text quality, and security. Furthermore, we validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We believe this framework provides novel insights into diverse watermarking paradigms. Our code is available at https://github.com/redwyd/SymMark.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09924v2
Securing WiFi Fingerprint-based Indoor Localization Systems from   Malicious Access Points,"WiFi fingerprint-based indoor localization schemes deliver highly accurate location data by matching the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) with an offline database using machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) models. However, over time, RSSI values degrade due to the malicious behavior of access points (APs), causing low positional accuracy due to RSSI value mismatch with the offline database. Existing literature lacks detection of malicious APs in the online phase and mitigating their effects. This research addresses these limitations and proposes a long-term reliable indoor localization scheme by incorporating malicious AP detection and their effect mitigation techniques. The proposed scheme uses a Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LGBM) classifier to estimate locations and integrates simple yet efficient techniques to detect malicious APs based on online query data. Subsequently, a mitigation technique is incorporated that updates the offline database and online queries by imputing stable values for malicious APs using LGBM Regressors. Additionally, we introduce a noise addition mechanism in the offline database to capture the dynamic environmental effects. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the proposed scheme attains a detection accuracy above 95% for each attack type. The mitigation strategy effectively restores the system's performance nearly to its original state when no malicious AP is present. The noise addition module reduces localization errors by nearly 16%. Furthermore, the proposed solution is lightweight, reducing the execution time by approximately 94% compared to the existing methods.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07724v1
LLM Watermarking Using Mixtures and Statistical-to-Computational Gaps,"Given a text, can we determine whether it was generated by a large language model (LLM) or by a human?

Also, in the harder open setting, where the adversary has access to most of the model, we propose an unremovable watermarking scheme.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01484v1
Intrusion Detection System Using Deep Learning for Network Security,"As the number of cyberattacks and their particualr nature escalate, the need for effective intrusion detection systems (IDS) has become indispensable for ensuring the security of contemporary networks. Adaptive and more sophisticated threats are often beyond the reach of traditional approaches to intrusion detection and access control. This paper proposes an experimental evaluation of IDS models based on deep learning techniques, focusing on the classification of network traffic into malicious and benign categories. We analyze and retrain an assortment of architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and LSTM models. Each model was tested based on a real dataset simulated in a multi-faceted and everchanging network traffic environment. Among the tested models, the best achieved an accuracy of 96 percent, underscoring the potential of deep learning models in improving efficiency and rapid response in IDS systems. The goal of the research is to demonstrate the effectiveness of distinct architectures and their corresponding trade-offs to enhance framework development for adaptive IDS solutions and improve overall network security.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05810v1
Adaptive Security Policy Management in Cloud Environments Using   Reinforcement Learning,"The security of cloud environments, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), is complex and dynamic. Static security policies have become inadequate as threats evolve and cloud resources exhibit elasticity [1]. This paper addresses the limitations of static policies by proposing a security policy management framework that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt dynamically. Specifically, we employ deep reinforcement learning algorithms, including deep Q Networks and proximal policy optimization, enabling the learning and continuous adjustment of controls such as firewall rules and Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. The proposed RL based solution leverages cloud telemetry data (AWS Cloud Trail logs, network traffic data, threat intelligence feeds) to continuously refine security policies, maximizing threat mitigation, and compliance while minimizing resource impact. Experimental results demonstrate that our adaptive RL based framework significantly outperforms static policies, achieving higher intrusion detection rates (92% compared to 82% for static policies) and substantially reducing incident detection and response times by 58%. In addition, it maintains high conformity with security requirements and efficient resource usage. These findings validate the effectiveness of adaptive reinforcement learning approaches in improving cloud security policy management.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08837v1
TokenProber: Jailbreaking Text-to-image Models via Fine-grained Word   Impact Analysis,"Text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly advanced in producing high-quality images. However, such models have the ability to generate images containing not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as pornography, violence, political content, and discrimination. To mitigate the risk of generating NSFW content, refusal mechanisms, i.e., safety checkers, have been developed to check potential NSFW content. Adversarial prompting techniques have been developed to evaluate the robustness of the refusal mechanisms. The key challenge remains to subtly modify the prompt in a way that preserves its sensitive nature while bypassing the refusal mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce TokenProber, a method designed for sensitivity-aware differential testing, aimed at evaluating the robustness of the refusal mechanisms in T2I models by generating adversarial prompts. Our approach is based on the key observation that adversarial prompts often succeed by exploiting discrepancies in how T2I models and safety checkers interpret sensitive content. Thus, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of the impact of specific words within prompts, distinguishing between dirty words that are essential for NSFW content generation and discrepant words that highlight the different sensitivity assessments between T2I models and safety checkers. Through the sensitivity-aware mutation, TokenProber generates adversarial prompts, striking a balance between maintaining NSFW content generation and evading detection. Our evaluation of TokenProber against 5 safety checkers on 3 popular T2I models, using 324 NSFW prompts, demonstrates its superior effectiveness in bypassing safety filters compared to existing methods (e.g., 54%+ increase on average), highlighting TokenProber's ability to uncover robustness issues in the existing refusal mechanisms.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08804v1
Co-Evolutionary Defence of Active Directory Attack Graphs via   GNN-Approximated Dynamic Programming,"Modern enterprise networks increasingly rely on Active Directory (AD) for identity and access management. However, this centralization exposes a single point of failure, allowing adversaries to compromise high-value assets. Existing AD defense approaches often assume static attacker behavior, but real-world adversaries adapt dynamically, rendering such methods brittle. To address this, we model attacker-defender interactions in AD as a Stackelberg game between an adaptive attacker and a proactive defender. We propose a co-evolutionary defense framework that combines Graph Neural Network Approximated Dynamic Programming (GNNDP) to model attacker strategies, with Evolutionary Diversity Optimization (EDO) to generate resilient blocking strategies. To ensure scalability, we introduce a Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) graph reduction method that reduces complexity while preserving strategic structure. Our framework jointly refines attacker and defender policies to improve generalization and prevent premature convergence. Experiments on synthetic AD graphs show near-optimal results (within 0.1 percent of optimality on r500) and improved performance on larger graphs (r1000 and r2000), demonstrating the framework's scalability and effectiveness.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11710v1
Rogue Cell: Adversarial Attack and Defense in Untrusted O-RAN Setup   Exploiting the Traffic Steering xApp,"The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture is revolutionizing cellular networks with its open, multi-vendor design and AI-driven management, aiming to enhance flexibility and reduce costs. Although it has many advantages, O-RAN is not threat-free. While previous studies have mainly examined vulnerabilities arising from O-RAN's intelligent components, this paper is the first to focus on the security challenges and vulnerabilities introduced by transitioning from single-operator to multi-operator RAN architectures. This shift increases the risk of untrusted third-party operators managing different parts of the network. To explore these vulnerabilities and their potential mitigation, we developed an open-access testbed environment that integrates a wireless network simulator with the official O-RAN Software Community (OSC) RAN intelligent component (RIC) cluster. This environment enables realistic, live data collection and serves as a platform for demonstrating APATE (adversarial perturbation against traffic efficiency), an evasion attack in which a malicious cell manipulates its reported key performance indicators (KPIs) and deceives the O-RAN traffic steering to gain unfair allocations of user equipment (UE). To ensure that O-RAN's legitimate activity continues, we introduce MARRS (monitoring adversarial RAN reports), a detection framework based on a long-short term memory (LSTM) autoencoder (AE) that learns contextual features across the network to monitor malicious telemetry (also demonstrated in our testbed). Our evaluation showed that by executing APATE, an attacker can obtain a 248.5% greater UE allocation than it was supposed to in a benign scenario. In addition, the MARRS detection method was also shown to successfully classify malicious cell activity, achieving accuracy of 99.2% and an F1 score of 0.978.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01816v1
An Empirical Study of Fuzz Harness Degradation,"The purpose of continuous fuzzing platforms is to enable fuzzing for software projects via \emph{fuzz harnesses} -- but as the projects continue to evolve, are these harnesses updated in lockstep, or do they run out of date? If these harnesses remain unmaintained, will they \emph{degrade} over time in terms of coverage achieved or number of bugs found? This is the subject of our study.   We study Google's OSS-Fuzz continuous fuzzing platform containing harnesses for 510 open-source C/C++ projects, many of which are security-critical. A harness is the glue code between the fuzzer and the project, so it needs to adapt to changes in the project. It is often added by a project maintainer or as part of a, sometimes short-lived, testing effort.   Our analysis shows a consistent overall fuzzer coverage percentage for projects in OSS-Fuzz and a surprising longevity of the bug-finding capability of harnesses even without explicit updates, as long as they still build. However, we also identify and manually examine individual cases of harness coverage degradation and categorize their root causes. Furthermore, we contribute to OSS-Fuzz and Fuzz Introspector to support metrics to detect harness degradation in OSS-Fuzz projects guided by this research.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06177v1
Adversarial Suffix Filtering: a Defense Pipeline for LLMs,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in autonomous systems and public-facing environments, yet they remain susceptible to jailbreak vulnerabilities that may undermine their security and trustworthiness. Adversarial suffixes are considered to be the current state-of-the-art jailbreak, consistently outperforming simpler methods and frequently succeeding even in black-box settings. Existing defenses rely on access to the internal architecture of models limiting diverse deployment, increase memory and computation footprints dramatically, or can be bypassed with simple prompt engineering methods. We introduce $\textbf{Adversarial Suffix Filtering}$ (ASF), a lightweight novel model-agnostic defensive pipeline designed to protect LLMs against adversarial suffix attacks. ASF functions as an input preprocessor and sanitizer that detects and filters adversarially crafted suffixes in prompts, effectively neutralizing malicious injections. We demonstrate that ASF provides comprehensive defense capabilities across both black-box and white-box attack settings, reducing the attack efficacy of state-of-the-art adversarial suffix generation methods to below 4%, while only minimally affecting the target model's capabilities in non-adversarial scenarios.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09602v1
"Fair Play for Individuals, Foul Play for Groups? Auditing   Anonymization's Impact on ML Fairness","Machine learning (ML) algorithms are heavily based on the availability of training data, which, depending on the domain, often includes sensitive information about data providers. This raises critical privacy concerns. Anonymization techniques have emerged as a practical solution to address these issues by generalizing features or suppressing data to make it more difficult to accurately identify individuals. Although recent studies have shown that privacy-enhancing technologies can influence ML predictions across different subgroups, thus affecting fair decision-making, the specific effects of anonymization techniques, such as $k$-anonymity, $\ell$-diversity, and $t$-closeness, on ML fairness remain largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically audit the impact of anonymization techniques on ML fairness, evaluating both individual and group fairness. Our quantitative study reveals that anonymization can degrade group fairness metrics by up to four orders of magnitude. Conversely, similarity-based individual fairness metrics tend to improve under stronger anonymization, largely as a result of increased input homogeneity. By analyzing varying levels of anonymization across diverse privacy settings and data distributions, this study provides critical insights into the trade-offs between privacy, fairness, and utility, offering actionable guidelines for responsible AI development.

The Ripple Effect: On Unforeseen Complications of Backdoor Attacks,"Recent research highlights concerns about the trustworthiness of third-party Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) due to potential backdoor attacks. These backdoored PTLMs, however, are effective only for specific pre-defined downstream tasks. In reality, these PTLMs can be adapted to many other unrelated downstream tasks. Such adaptation may lead to unforeseen consequences in downstream model outputs, consequently raising user suspicion and compromising attack stealthiness. We refer to this phenomenon as backdoor complications. In this paper, we undertake the first comprehensive quantification of backdoor complications. Through extensive experiments using 4 prominent PTLMs and 16 text classification benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the widespread presence of backdoor complications in downstream models fine-tuned from backdoored PTLMs. The output distribution of triggered samples significantly deviates from that of clean samples. Consequently, we propose a backdoor complication reduction method leveraging multi-task learning to mitigate complications without prior knowledge of downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively reduce complications while maintaining the efficacy and consistency of backdoor attacks.

On the Vulnerability of Underwater Magnetic Induction Communication,"Typical magnetic induction (MI) communication is commonly considered a secure underwater wireless communication (UWC) technology due to its non-audible and non-visible nature compared to acoustic and optical UWC technologies. However, vulnerabilities in communication systems inevitably exist and may lead to different types of attacks. In this paper, we investigate the eavesdropping attack in underwater MI communication to quantitatively measure the system's vulnerability under this attack. We consider different potential eavesdropping configuration setups based on the positions and orientations of the eavesdropper node to investigate how they impact the received voltage and secrecy at the legitimate receiver node. To this end, we develop finite-element-method-based simulation models for each configuration in an underwater environment and evaluate the received voltage and the secrecy capacity against different system parameters such as magnetic flux, magnetic flux density, distance, and orientation sensitivity. Furthermore, we construct an experimental setup within a laboratory environment to replicate the simulation experiments. Both simulation and lab experimental confirm the susceptibility of underwater MI communication to eavesdropping attacks. However, this vulnerability is highly dependent on the position and orientation of the coil between the eavesdropper and the legitimate transmitter. On the positive side, we also observe a unique behavior in the received coil reception that might be used to detect malicious node activities in the vicinity, which might lead to a potential security mechanism against eavesdropping attacks.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04249v1
Measuring the Accuracy and Effectiveness of PII Removal Services,"This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of commercial personally identifiable information (PII) removal systems -- commercial services that claim to improve privacy by automating the removal of PII from data broker's databases. Popular examples of such services include DeleteMe, Mozilla Monitor, Incogni, among many others. The claims these services make may be very appealing to privacy-conscious Web users, but how effective these services actually are at improving privacy has not been investigated. This work aims to improve our understanding of commercial PII removal services in multiple ways. First, we conduct a user study where participants purchase subscriptions from four popular PII removal services, and report (i) what PII the service find, (ii) from which data brokers, (iii) whether the service is able to have the information removed, and (iv) whether the identified information actually is PII describing the participant. And second, by comparing the claims and promises the services makes (e.g. which and how many data brokers each service claims to cover). We find that these services have significant accuracy and coverage issues that limit the usefulness of these services as a privacy-enhancing technology. For example, we find that the measured services are unable to remove the majority of the identified PII records from data broker's (48.2% of the successfully removed found records) and that most records identified by these services are not PII about the user (study participants found that only 41.1% of records identified by these services were PII about themselves).",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06989v2
GDPRShield: AI-Powered GDPR Support for Software Developers in Small and   Medium-Sized Enterprises,"With the rapid increase in privacy violations in modern software development, regulatory frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have been established to enforce strict data protection practices. However, insufficient privacy awareness among SME software developers contributes to failure in GDPR compliance. For instance, a developer unfamiliar with data minimization may build a system that collects excessive data, violating GDPR and risking fines. One reason for this lack of awareness is that developers in SMEs often take on multidisciplinary roles (e.g., front-end, back-end, database management, and privacy compliance), which limits specialization in privacy. This lack of awareness may lead to poor privacy attitudes, ultimately hindering the development of a strong organizational privacy culture. However, SMEs that achieve GDPR compliance may gain competitive advantages, such as increased user trust and marketing value, compared to others that do not.   Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel AI-powered framework called ""GDPRShield,"" specifically designed to enhance the GDPR awareness of SME software developers and, through this, improve their privacy attitudes. Simultaneously, GDPRShield boosts developers' motivation to comply with GDPR from the early stages of software development. It leverages functional requirements written as user stories to provide comprehensive GDPR-based privacy descriptions tailored to each requirement. Alongside improving awareness, GDPRShield strengthens motivation by presenting real-world consequences of noncompliance, such as heavy fines, reputational damage, and loss of user trust, aligned with each requirement. This dual focus on awareness and motivation leads developers to engage with GDPRShield, improving their GDPR compliance and privacy attitudes, which will help SMEs build a stronger privacy culture over time.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12640v1
LibVulnWatch: A Deep Assessment Agent System and Leaderboard for   Uncovering Hidden Vulnerabilities in Open-Source AI Libraries,"Open-source AI libraries are foundational to modern AI systems but pose significant, underexamined risks across security, licensing, maintenance, supply chain integrity, and regulatory compliance. We present LibVulnWatch, a graph-based agentic assessment framework that performs deep, source-grounded evaluations of these libraries. Built on LangGraph, the system coordinates a directed acyclic graph of specialized agents to extract, verify, and quantify risk using evidence from trusted sources such as repositories, documentation, and vulnerability databases. LibVulnWatch generates reproducible, governance-aligned scores across five critical domains, publishing them to a public leaderboard for longitudinal ecosystem monitoring. Applied to 20 widely used libraries, including ML frameworks, LLM inference engines, and agent orchestration tools, our system covers up to 88% of OpenSSF Scorecard checks while uncovering up to 19 additional risks per library. These include critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, absent Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs), licensing constraints, undocumented telemetry, and widespread gaps in regulatory documentation and auditability. By translating high-level governance principles into practical, verifiable metrics, LibVulnWatch advances technical AI governance with a scalable, transparent mechanism for continuous supply chain risk assessment and informed library selection.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08842v1
LARGO: Latent Adversarial Reflection through Gradient Optimization for   Jailbreaking LLMs,"Efficient red-teaming method to uncover vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial. While recent attacks often use LLMs as optimizers, the discrete language space make gradient-based methods struggle. We introduce LARGO (Latent Adversarial Reflection through Gradient Optimization), a novel latent self-reflection attack that reasserts the power of gradient-based optimization for generating fluent jailbreaking prompts. By operating within the LLM's continuous latent space, LARGO first optimizes an adversarial latent vector and then recursively call the same LLM to decode the latent into natural language. This methodology yields a fast, effective, and transferable attack that produces fluent and stealthy prompts. On standard benchmarks like AdvBench and JailbreakBench, LARGO surpasses leading jailbreaking techniques, including AutoDAN, by 44 points in attack success rate. Our findings demonstrate a potent alternative to agentic LLM prompting, highlighting the efficacy of interpreting and attacking LLM internals through gradient optimization.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10838v1
Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks on a Computer Mouse,"Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks (ASCAs) extract sensitive information by using audio emitted from a computing devices and their peripherals. Attacks targeting keyboards are popular and have been explored in the literature. However, similar attacks targeting other human interface peripherals, such as computer mice, are under-explored. To this end, this paper considers security leakage via acoustic signals emanating from normal mouse usage. We first confirm feasibility of such attacks by showing a proof-of-concept attack that classifies four mouse movements with 97% accuracy in a controlled environment. We then evolve the attack towards discerning twelve unique mouse movements using a smartphone to record the experiment. Using Machine Learning (ML) techniques, the model is trained on an experiment with six participants to be generalizable and discern among twelve movements with 94% accuracy. In addition, we experiment with an attack that detects a user action of closing a full-screen window on a laptop. Achieving an accuracy of 91%, this experiment highlights exploiting audio leakage from computer mouse movements in a realistic scenario.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02725v1
Neural-Inspired Advances in Integral Cryptanalysis,"The study by Gohr et.al at CRYPTO 2019 and sunsequent related works have shown that neural networks can uncover previously unused features, offering novel insights into cryptanalysis. Motivated by these findings, we employ neural networks to learn features specifically related to integral properties and integrate the corresponding insights into optimized search frameworks. These findings validate the framework of using neural networks for feature exploration, providing researchers with novel insights that advance established cryptanalysis methods.   Neural networks have inspired the development of more precise integral search models. By comparing the integral distinguishers obtained via neural networks with those identified by classical methods, we observe that existing automated search models often fail to find optimal distinguishers. To address this issue, we develop a meet in the middle search framework that balances model accuracy and computational efficiency. As a result, we reduce the number of active plaintext bits required for an 11 rounds integral distinguisher on SKINNY64/64, and further identify a 12 rounds key dependent integral distinguisher achieving one additional round over the previous best-known result.   The integral distinguishers discovered by neural networks enable key recovery attacks on more rounds. We identify a 7 rounds key independent integral distinguisher from neural networks with even only one active plaintext cell, which is based on linear combinations of bits. This distinguisher enables a 15 rounds key recovery attack on SKINNYn/n, improving upon the previous record by one round. Additionally, we discover an 8 rounds key dependent integral distinguisher using neural network that further reduces the time complexity of key recovery attacks against SKINNY.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10790v1
SafeTab-H: Disclosure Avoidance for the 2020 Census Detailed Demographic   and Housing Characteristics File B (Detailed DHC-B),"This article describes SafeTab-H, a disclosure avoidance algorithm applied to the release of the U.S. Census Bureau's Detailed Demographic and Housing Characteristics File B (Detailed DHC-B) as part of the 2020 Census. The tabulations contain household statistics about household type and tenure iterated by the householder's detailed race, ethnicity, or American Indian and Alaska Native tribe and village at varying levels of geography. We describe the algorithmic strategy which is based on adding noise from a discrete Gaussian distribution and show that the algorithm satisfies a well-studied variant of differential privacy, called zero-concentrated differential privacy. We discuss how the implementation of the SafeTab-H codebase relies on the Tumult Analytics privacy library. We also describe the theoretical expected error properties of the algorithm and explore various aspects of its parameter tuning.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03072v1
Automated Profile Inference with Language Model Agents,"Impressive progress has been made in automated problem-solving by the collaboration of large language models (LLMs) based agents. However, these automated capabilities also open avenues for malicious applications. In this paper, we study a new threat that LLMs pose to online pseudonymity, called automated profile inference, where an adversary can instruct LLMs to automatically scrape and extract sensitive personal attributes from publicly visible user activities on pseudonymous platforms. We also introduce an automated profiling framework called AutoProfiler to assess the feasibility of such threats in real-world scenarios. AutoProfiler consists of four specialized LLM agents, who work collaboratively to collect and process user online activities and generate a profile with extracted personal information. Experimental results on two real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that AutoProfiler is highly effective and efficient, and can be easily deployed on a web scale. We demonstrate that the inferred attributes are both sensitive and identifiable, posing significant risks of privacy breaches, such as de-anonymization and sensitive information leakage. Additionally, we explore mitigation strategies from different perspectives and advocate for increased public awareness of this emerging privacy threat to online pseudonymity.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12402v1
An \tilde{O}ptimal Differentially Private Learner for Concept Classes   with VC Dimension 1,"We present the first nearly optimal differentially private PAC learner for any concept class with VC dimension 1 and Littlestone dimension $d$. Our algorithm achieves the sample complexity of $\tilde{O}_{\varepsilon,\delta,\alpha,\delta}(\log^* d)$, nearly matching the lower bound of $\Omega(\log^* d)$ proved by Alon et al. [STOC19]. Prior to our work, the best known upper bound is $\tilde{O}(VC\cdot d^5)$ for general VC classes, as shown by Ghazi et al. [STOC21].",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06581v1
Invariant-Based Cryptography: Toward a General Framework,"We develop a generalized framework for invariant-based cryptography by extending the use of structural identities as core cryptographic mechanisms. Starting from a previously introduced scheme where a secret is encoded via a four-point algebraic invariant over masked functional values, we broaden the approach to include multiple classes of invariant constructions. In particular, we present new symmetric schemes based on shifted polynomial roots and functional equations constrained by symmetric algebraic conditions, such as discriminants and multilinear identities. These examples illustrate how algebraic invariants -- rather than one-way functions -- can enforce structural consistency and unforgeability. We analyze the cryptographic utility of such invariants in terms of recoverability, integrity binding, and resistance to forgery, and show that these constructions achieve security levels comparable to the original oscillatory model. This work establishes a foundation for invariant-based design as a versatile and compact alternative in symmetric cryptographic protocols.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08115v1
Detecting Quishing Attacks with Machine Learning Techniques Through QR   Code Analysis,"The rise of QR code based phishing (""Quishing"") poses a growing cybersecurity threat, as attackers increasingly exploit QR codes to bypass traditional phishing defenses. Existing detection methods predominantly focus on URL analysis, which requires the extraction of the QR code payload, and may inadvertently expose users to malicious content. Moreover, QR codes can encode various types of data beyond URLs, such as Wi-Fi credentials and payment information, making URL-based detection insufficient for broader security concerns. To address these gaps, we propose the first framework for quishing detection that directly analyzes QR code structure and pixel patterns without extracting the embedded content. We generated a dataset of phishing and benign QR codes and we used it to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Our best-performing model (XGBoost) achieves an AUC of 0.9106, demonstrating the feasibility of QR-centric detection. Through feature importance analysis, we identify key visual indicators of malicious intent and refine our feature set by removing non-informative pixels, improving performance to an AUC of 0.9133 with a reduced feature space. Our findings reveal that the structural features of QR code correlate strongly with phishing risk. This work establishes a foundation for quishing mitigation and highlights the potential of direct QR analysis as a critical layer in modern phishing defenses.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03451v1
Non-Adaptive Cryptanalytic Time-Space Lower Bounds via a Shearer-like   Inequality for Permutations,"The power of adaptivity in algorithms has been intensively studied in diverse areas of theoretical computer science. In this paper, we obtain a number of sharp lower bound results which show that adaptivity provides a significant extra power in cryptanalytic time-space tradeoffs with (possibly unlimited) preprocessing time.   Most notably, we consider the discrete logarithm (DLOG) problem in a generic group of $N$ elements. The classical `baby-step giant-step' algorithm for the problem has time complexity $T=O(\sqrt{N})$, uses $O(\sqrt{N})$ bits of space (up to logarithmic factors in $N$) and achieves constant success probability.   We examine a generalized setting where an algorithm obtains an advice string of $S$ bits and is allowed to make $T$ arbitrary non-adaptive queries that depend on the advice string (but not on the challenge group element).   We show that in this setting, the $T=O(\sqrt{N})$ online time complexity of the baby-step giant-step algorithm cannot be improved, unless the advice string is more than $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ bits long. This lies in stark contrast with the classical adaptive Pollard's rho algorithm for DLOG, which can exploit preprocessing to obtain the tradeoff curve $ST^2=O(N)$. We obtain similar sharp lower bounds for several other cryptanalytic problems.   To obtain our results, we present a new model that allows analyzing non-adaptive preprocessing algorithms for a wide array of search and decision problems in a unified way. Since previous proof techniques inherently cannot distinguish between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms for the problems in our model, they cannot be used to obtain our results. Consequently, our proof uses a variant of Shearer's lemma for this setting, due to Barthe, Cordero-Erausquin, Ledoux, and Maurey (2011). This seems to be the first time a variant of Shearer's lemma for permutations is used in an algorithmic context.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00894v1
GenoArmory: A Unified Evaluation Framework for Adversarial Attacks on   Genomic Foundation Models,"We propose the first unified adversarial attack benchmark for Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs), named GenoArmory. Unlike existing GFM benchmarks, GenoArmory offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks. Methodologically, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of five state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely adopted attack algorithms and three defense strategies. Importantly, our benchmark provides an accessible and comprehensive framework to analyze GFM vulnerabilities with respect to model architecture, quantization schemes, and training datasets. Additionally, we introduce GenoAdv, a new adversarial sample dataset designed to improve GFM safety. Empirically, classification models exhibit greater robustness to adversarial perturbations compared to generative models, highlighting the impact of task type on model vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10983v1
A Large-Scale Empirical Analysis of Custom GPTs' Vulnerabilities in the   OpenAI Ecosystem,"Millions of users leverage generative pretrained transformer (GPT)-based language models developed by leading model providers for a wide range of tasks. To support enhanced user interaction and customization, many platforms-such as OpenAI-now enable developers to create and publish tailored model instances, known as custom GPTs, via dedicated repositories or application stores. These custom GPTs empower users to browse and interact with specialized applications designed to meet specific needs. However, as custom GPTs see growing adoption, concerns regarding their security vulnerabilities have intensified. Existing research on these vulnerabilities remains largely theoretical, often lacking empirical, large-scale, and statistically rigorous assessments of associated risks.   In this study, we analyze 14,904 custom GPTs to assess their susceptibility to seven exploitable threats, such as roleplay-based attacks, system prompt leakage, phishing content generation, and malicious code synthesis, across various categories and popularity tiers within the OpenAI marketplace. We introduce a multi-metric ranking system to examine the relationship between a custom GPT's popularity and its associated security risks.   Our findings reveal that over 95% of custom GPTs lack adequate security protections. The most prevalent vulnerabilities include roleplay-based vulnerabilities (96.51%), system prompt leakage (92.20%), and phishing (91.22%). Furthermore, we demonstrate that OpenAI's foundational models exhibit inherent security weaknesses, which are often inherited or amplified in custom GPTs. These results highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures and stricter content moderation to ensure the safe deployment of GPT-based applications.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08148v1
A Novel Feature-Aware Chaotic Image Encryption Scheme For Data Security   and Privacy in IoT and Edge Networks,"The security of image data in the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge networks is crucial due to the increasing deployment of intelligent systems for real-time decision-making. Traditional encryption algorithms such as AES and RSA are computationally expensive for resource-constrained IoT devices and ineffective for large-volume image data, leading to inefficiencies in privacy-preserving distributed learning applications. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a novel Feature-Aware Chaotic Image Encryption scheme that integrates Feature-Aware Pixel Segmentation (FAPS) with Chaotic Chain Permutation and Confusion mechanisms to enhance security while maintaining efficiency. The proposed scheme consists of three stages: (1) FAPS, which extracts and reorganizes pixels based on high and low edge intensity features for correlation disruption; (2) Chaotic Chain Permutation, which employs a logistic chaotic map with SHA-256-based dynamically updated keys for block-wise permutation; and (3) Chaotic chain Confusion, which utilises dynamically generated chaotic seed matrices for bitwise XOR operations. Extensive security and performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly reduces pixel correlation -- almost zero, achieves high entropy values close to 8, and resists differential cryptographic attacks. The optimum design of the proposed scheme makes it suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.",CYB,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00593v1
Code Generation for Cryptographic Kernels using Multi-word Modular   Arithmetic on GPU,"Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are emerging as solutions for data security in distributed environments. However, the widespread adoption of these encryption techniques is hindered by their significant computational overhead, primarily resulting from core cryptographic operations that involve large integer arithmetic. This paper presents a formalization of multi-word modular arithmetic (MoMA), which breaks down large bit-width integer arithmetic into operations on machine words. We further develop a rewrite system that implements MoMA through recursive rewriting of data types, designed for compatibility with compiler infrastructures and code generators. We evaluate MoMA by generating cryptographic kernels, including basic linear algebra subprogram (BLAS) operations and the number theoretic transform (NTT), targeting various GPUs. Our MoMA-based BLAS operations outperform state-of-the-art multi-precision libraries by orders of magnitude, and MoMA-based NTTs achieve near-ASIC performance on commodity GPUs.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07535v1
Introducing Support for Move Operations in Melda CRDT,"In this paper, we present an extension to Melda (a library which implements a general purpose delta state JSON CRDT) to support move operations. This enhancement relies on minimal changes to the underlying logic of the data structure, has virtually no runtime overhead and zero storage overhead compared to the original version of the library, ensuring simplicity while addressing multiple use cases. Although concurrent reordering of the elements in a list was already supported in the original version of the library, moving objects between different containers lead to undesired outcomes, namely duplicate entries. To address this problem we revisited the original approach and introduced the necessary changes to support for relocating elements within a JSON structure. We detail those changes and provide some examples.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04811v1
AbsInf: A Lightweight Object to Represent float('inf') in Dijkstra's   Algorithm,"We introduce AbsInf, a lightweight abstract object designed as a high-performance alternative to Python's native float('inf') within pathfinding algorithms. Implemented as a C-based Python extension, AbsInf bypasses IEEE-754 float coercion and dynamic type dispatch, offering constant-time dominance comparisons and arithmetic neutrality. When integrated into Dijkstra's algorithm without altering its logic, AbsInf reduces runtime by up to 17.2%, averaging 9.74% across diverse synthetic and real-world graph datasets. This optimization highlights the performance trade-offs in high-frequency algorithmic constructs, where a symbolic use of infinity permits efficient abstraction. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on lightweight architectural enhancements for interpreted languages, particularly in performance-critical control flows.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04302v1
On the State of Coherence in the Land of Type Classes,"Type classes are a popular tool for implementing generic algorithms and data structures without loss of efficiency, bridging the gap between parametric and ad-hoc polymorphism. Since their initial development in Haskell, they now feature prominently in numerous other industry-ready programming languages, notably including Swift, Rust, and Scala. The success of type classes hinges in large part on the compilers' ability to infer arguments to implicit parameters by means of a type-directed resolution. This technique, sometimes dubbed **implicit programming**, lets users elide information that the language implementation can deduce from the context, such as the implementation of a particular type class.   One drawback of implicit programming is that a type-directed resolution may yield ambiguous results, thereby threatening coherence, the property that valid programs have exactly one meaning. This issue has divided the community on the right approach to address it. One side advocates for flexibility where implicit resolution is context-sensitive and often relies on dependent typing features to uphold soundness. The other holds that context should not stand in the way of equational reasoning and typically imposes that type class instances be unique across the entire program to fend off ambiguities.   Although there exists a large body of work on type classes and implicit programming, most of the scholarly literature focuses on a few select languages and offers little insight into other mainstream projects. Meanwhile, the latter have evolved similar features and/or restrictions under different names, making it difficult for language users and designers to get a sense of the full design space. To alleviate this issue, we set to examine Swift, Rust, and Scala, three popular languages featuring type classes heavily, and relate their approach to coherence to Haskell's. It turns out that, beyond superficial syntactic differences, Swift, Rust, and Haskell are actually strikingly similar in that the three languages offer comparable strategies to work around the limitations of the uniqueness of type class instances.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20546v1
Futureproof Static Memory Planning,"The NP-complete combinatorial optimization task of assigning offsets to a set of buffers with known sizes and lifetimes so as to minimize total memory usage is called dynamic storage allocation (DSA). Existing DSA implementations bypass the theoretical state-of-the-art algorithms in favor of either fast but wasteful heuristics, or memory-efficient approaches that do not scale beyond one thousand buffers. The ""AI memory wall"", combined with deep neural networks' static architecture, has reignited interest in DSA. We present idealloc, a low-fragmentation, high-performance DSA implementation designed for million-buffer instances. Evaluated on a novel suite of particularly hard benchmarks from several domains, idealloc ranks first against four production implementations in terms of a joint effectiveness/robustness criterion.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04874v1
Enforcing MAVLink Safety & Security Properties Via Refined Multiparty   Session Types,"A compromised system component can issue message sequences that are legal while also leading the overall system into unsafe states. Such stealthy attacks are challenging to characterize, because message interfaces in standard languages specify each individual message separately but do not specify safe sequences of messages. We present initial results from ongoing work applying refined multiparty session types as a mechanism for expressing and enforcing proper message usage to exclude unsafe sequences. We illustrate our approach by using refined multiparty session types to mitigate safety and security issues in the MAVLink protocol commonly used in UAVs.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18874v2
Vbox: Efficient Black-Box Serializability Verification,"Verifying the serializability of transaction histories is essential for users to know if the DBMS ensures the claimed serializable isolation level without potential bugs. Black-box serializability verification is a promising approach. Existing verification methods often have one or more limitations such as incomplete detection of data anomalies, long verification time, high memory usage, or dependence on specific concurrency control protocols. In this paper, a new black-box serializability verification method called \textsf{Vbox} is proposed. \textsf{Vbox} is powered by a number of new techniques, including the support for predicate database operations, comprehensive applications of transactions' time information in the verification process, and a simplified satisfiability (SAT) problem formulation and its efficient solver. In this paper, \textsf{Vbox} is verified to be correct, efficient, and capable of detecting more data anomalies, while not relying on any specific concurrency control protocols.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05163v1
Partial Incorrectness Logic,"Reasoning about program correctness has been a central topic in static analysis for many years, with Hoare logic (HL) playing an important role. The key notions in HL are partial and total correctness. Both require that program executions starting in a specified set of initial states (the precondition) reach a designated set of final states (the postcondition). Partial correctness is more lenient in that it does not require termination, effectively deeming divergence acceptable. We explore partial incorrectness logic, which stands in relation to O'Hearn's ""total"" incorrectness logic as partial correctness does to total correctness: Partial correctness allows divergence, partial incorrectness allows unreachability. While the duality between divergence and unreachability may not be immediately apparent, we explore this relationship further. Our chosen formalism is predicate transformers \`a la Dijkstra. We focus here on deterministic and reversible programs, though the discussion extends to nondeterministic and irreversible computations, both of which introduce additional nondeterminism that must be addressed.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14626v1
A Multi-level Compiler Backend for Accelerated Micro-kernels Targeting   RISC-V ISA Extensions,"High-performance micro-kernels must fully exploit today's diverse and specialized hardware to deliver peak performance to DNNs. While higher-level optimizations for DNNs are offered by numerous compilers (e.g., MLIR, TVM, OpenXLA), performance-critical micro-kernels are left to specialized code generators or handwritten assembly. Even though widely-adopted compilers (e.g., LLVM, GCC) offer tuned backends, their CPU-focused input abstraction, unstructured IR, and general-purpose best-effort design inhibit tailored code generation for innovative hardware. We think it is time to widen the classical hourglass backend and embrace progressive lowering across a diverse set of structured abstractions to bring domain-specific code generation to compiler backends. We demonstrate this concept by implementing a custom backend for a RISC-V-based accelerator with hardware loops and streaming registers, leveraging knowledge about the hardware at levels of abstraction that match its custom ISA. We use incremental register allocation over structured IRs, while dropping classical spilling heuristics, and show up to 90% FPU utilization across key DNN kernels. By breaking the backend hourglass model, we reopen the path from domain-specific abstractions to specialized hardware.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04063v1
Laws of Quantum Programming,"In this paper, we investigate the fundamental laws of quantum programming. We extend a comprehensive set of Hoare et al.'s basic laws of classical programming to the quantum setting. These laws characterise the algebraic properties of quantum programs, such as the distributivity of sequential composition over (quantum) if-statements and the unfolding of nested (quantum) if-statements. At the same time, we clarify some subtle differences between certain laws of classical programming and their quantum counterparts. Additionally, we derive a fixpoint characterization of quantum while-loops and a loop-based realisation of tail recursion in quantum programming. Furthermore, we establish two normal form theorems: one for quantum circuits and one for finite quantum programs. The theory in which these laws are established is formalised in the Coq proof assistant, and all of these laws are mechanically verified. As an application case of our laws, we present a formal derivation of the principle of deferred measurements in dynamic quantum circuits.   We expect that these laws can be utilized in correctness-preserving transformation, compilation, and automatic code optimization in quantum programming. In particular, because these laws are formally verified in Coq, they can be confidently applied in quantum program development.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19463v1
Multi-Language Probabilistic Programming,"There are many different probabilistic programming languages that are specialized to specific kinds of probabilistic programs. From a usability and scalability perspective, this is undesirable: today, probabilistic programmers are forced up-front to decide which language they want to use and cannot mix-and-match different languages for handling heterogeneous programs. To rectify this, we seek a foundation for sound interoperability for probabilistic programming languages: just as today's Python programmers can resort to low-level C programming for performance, we argue that probabilistic programmers should be able to freely mix different languages for meeting the demands of heterogeneous probabilistic programming environments. As a first step towards this goal, we introduce \textsc{MultiPPL}, a probabilistic multi-language that enables programmers to interoperate between two different probabilistic programming languages: one that leverages a high-performance exact discrete inference strategy, and one that uses approximate importance sampling. We give a syntax and semantics for \textsc{MultiPPL}, prove soundness of its inference algorithm, and provide empirical evidence that it enables programmers to perform inference on complex heterogeneous probabilistic programs and flexibly exploits the strengths and weaknesses of two languages simultaneously.%",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19538v1
The Simulation Semantics of Synthesisable Verilog,"Despite numerous previous formalisation projects targeting Verilog, the semantics of Verilog defined by the Verilog standard -- Verilog's simulation semantics -- has thus far eluded definitive mathematical formalisation. Previous projects on formalising the semantics have made good progress but no previous project provides a formalisation that can be used to execute or formally reason about real-world hardware designs. In this paper, we show that the reason for this is that the Verilog standard is inconsistent both with Verilog practice and itself. We pinpoint a series of problems in the Verilog standard that we have identified in how the standard defines the semantics of the subset of Verilog used to describe hardware designs, that is, the synthesisable subset of Verilog. We show how the most complete Verilog formalisation to date inherits these problems and how, after we repair these problems in an executable implementation of the formalisation, the repaired implementation can be used to execute real-world hardware designs. The existing formalisation together with the repairs hence constitute the first formalisation of Verilog's simulation semantics compatible with real-world hardware designs. Additionally, to make the results of this paper accessible to a wider (nonmathematical) audience, we provide a visual formalisation of Verilog's simulation semantics.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19348v2
Adaptive Branch-and-Bound Tree Exploration for Neural Network   Verification,"Formal verification is a rigorous approach that can provably ensure the quality of neural networks, and to date, Branch and Bound (BaB) is the state-of-the-art that performs verification by splitting the problem as needed and applying off-the-shelf verifiers to sub-problems for improved performance. However, existing BaB may not be efficient, due to its naive way of exploring the space of sub-problems that ignores the \emph{importance} of different sub-problems. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a notion of ``importance'' that reflects how likely a counterexample can be found with a sub-problem, and then we devise a novel verification approach, called ABONN, that explores the sub-problem space of BaB adaptively, in a Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) style. The exploration is guided by the ``importance'' of different sub-problems, so it favors the sub-problems that are more likely to find counterexamples. As soon as it finds a counterexample, it can immediately terminate; even though it cannot find, after visiting all the sub-problems, it can still manage to verify the problem. We evaluate ABONN with 552 verification problems from commonly-used datasets and neural network models, and compare it with the state-of-the-art verifiers as baseline approaches. Experimental evaluation shows that ABONN demonstrates speedups of up to $15.2\times$ on MNIST and $24.7\times$ on CIFAR-10. We further study the influences of hyperparameters to the performance of ABONN, and the effectiveness of our adaptive tree exploration.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00963v1
Monk: Opportunistic Scheduling to Delay Horizontal Scaling,"In modern server computing, efficient CPU resource usage is often traded for latency. Garbage collection is a key aspect of memory management in programming languages like Java, but it often competes with application threads for CPU time, leading to delays in processing requests and consequent increases in latency. This work explores if opportunistic scheduling in ZGC, a fully concurrent garbage collector (GC), can reduce application latency on middle-range CPU utilization, a topical deployment, and potentially delay horizontal scaling. We implemented an opportunistic scheduling that schedules GC threads during periods when CPU resources would otherwise be idle. This method prioritizes application threads over GC workers when it matters most, allowing the system to handle higher workloads without increasing latency. Our findings show that this technique can significantly improve performance in server applications. For example, in tests using the SPECjbb2015 benchmark, we observed up to a 15\% increase in the number of requests processed within the target 25ms latency. Additionally, applications like Hazelcast showed a mean latency reduction of up to 40% compared to ZGC without opportunistic scheduling. The feasibility and effectiveness of this approach were validated through empirical testing on two widely used benchmarks, showing that the method consistently improves performance under various workloads. This work is significant because it addresses a common bottleneck in server performance -- how to manage GC without degrading application responsiveness. By improving how GC threads are scheduled, this research offers a pathway to more efficient resource usage, enabling higher performance and better scalability in server applications.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20522v1
ClassInvGen: Class Invariant Synthesis using Large Language Models,"Formal program specifications in the form of preconditions, postconditions, and class invariants have several benefits for the construction and maintenance of programs. They not only aid in program understanding due to their unambiguous semantics but can also be enforced dynamically (or even statically when the language supports a formal verifier). However, synthesizing high-quality specifications in an underlying programming language is limited by the expressivity of the specifications or the need to express them in a declarative manner. Prior work has demonstrated the potential of large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing high-quality method pre/postconditions for Python and Java, but does not consider class invariants.   In this work, we describe ClassInvGen, a method for co-generating executable class invariants and test inputs to produce high-quality class invariants for a mainstream language such as C++, leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize pure functions. We show that ClassInvGen outperforms a pure LLM-based technique to generate specifications (from code) as well as prior data-driven invariant inference techniques such as Daikon. We contribute a benchmark of standard C++ data structures along with a harness that can help measure both the correctness and completeness of generated specifications using tests and mutants. We also demonstrate its applicability to real-world code by performing a case study on several classes within a widely used and high-integrity C++ codebase.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18917v1
QPanda3: A High-Performance Software-Hardware Collaborative Framework   for Large-Scale Quantum-Classical Computing Integration,"QPanda3 is a high-performance quantum programming framework that enhances quantum computing efficiency through optimized circuit compilation, an advanced instruction stream format (OriginBIS), and hardware-aware execution strategies. These engineering optimizations significantly improve both processing speed and system performance, addressing key challenges in the NISQ era. A core innovation, OriginBIS, accelerates encoding speeds by up to 86.9x compared to OpenQASM 2.0, while decoding is 35.6x faster, leading to more efficient data handling, reduced memory overhead, and improved communication efficiency. This directly enhances the execution of quantum circuits, making large-scale quantum simulations more feasible. Comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates QPanda3's superior performance: quantum circuit construction is 20.7x faster, execution speeds improve by 3.4x, and transpilation efficiency increases by 14.97x over Qiskit. Notably, in compiling a 118-qubit W-state circuit on a 2D-grid topology, QPanda3 achieves an unprecedented 869.9x speedup, underscoring its ability to handle complex quantum workloads at scale. By combining high-speed quantum processing with a modular and extensible software architecture, QPanda3 provides a practical bridge between today's NISQ devices and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. It facilitates real-world applications in financial modeling, materials science, and combinatorial optimization, while its robust and scalable design supports industrial adoption and cloud-based deployment.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02455v1
RustMC: Extending the GenMC stateless model checker to Rust,"RustMC is a stateless model checker that enables verification of concurrent Rust programs. As both Rust and C/C++ compile to LLVM IR, RustMC builds on GenMC which provides a verification framework for LLVM IR. This enables the automatic verification of Rust code and any C/C++ dependencies. This tool paper presents the key challenges we addressed to extend GenMC. These challenges arise from Rust's unique compilation strategy and include intercepting threading operations, handling memory intrinsics and uninitialized accesses. Through case studies adapted from real-world programs, we demonstrate RustMC's effectiveness at finding concurrency bugs stemming from unsafe Rust code, FFI calls to C/C++, and incorrect use of atomic operations.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06293v1
An Automata-theoretic Basis for Specification and Type Checking of   Multiparty Protocols,"We propose the Automata-based Multiparty Protocols framework (AMP) for top-down protocol development. The framework features a new very general formalism for global protocol specifications called Protocol State Machines (PSMs), Communicating State Machines (CSMs) as specifications for local participants, and a type system to check a $\pi$-calculus with session interleaving and delegation against the CSM specification. Moreover, we define a large class of PSMs, called ""tame"", for which we provide a sound and complete PSPACE projection operation that computes a CSM describing the same protocol as a given PSM if one exists. We propose these components as a backwards-compatible new backend for frameworks in the style of Multiparty Session Types. In comparison to the latter, AMP offers a considerable improvement in expressivity, decoupling of the various components (e.g. projection and typing), and robustness (thanks to the complete projection).",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16977v1
An Algebraic Approach to Weighted Answer-set Programming,"Logic programs, more specifically, Answer-set programs, can be annotated with probabilities on facts to express uncertainty. We address the problem of propagating weight annotations on facts (eg probabilities) of an ASP to its standard models, and from there to events (defined as sets of atoms) in a dataset over the program's domain. We propose a novel approach which is algebraic in the sense that it relies on an equivalence relation over the set of events. Uncertainty is then described as polynomial expressions over variables. We propagate the weight function in the space of models and events, rather than doing so within the syntax of the program. As evidence that our approach is sound, we show that certain facts behave as expected. Our approach allows us to investigate weight annotated programs and to determine how suitable a given one is for modeling a given dataset containing events.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20849v2
SymRTLO: Enhancing RTL Code Optimization with LLMs and Neuron-Inspired   Symbolic Reasoning,"Optimizing Register Transfer Level (RTL) code is crucial for improving the power, performance, and area (PPA) of digital circuits in the early stages of synthesis. Manual rewriting, guided by synthesis feedback, can yield high-quality results but is time-consuming and error-prone. Most existing compiler-based approaches have difficulty handling complex design constraints. Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative to address these challenges. However, LLM-based approaches often face difficulties in ensuring alignment between the generated code and the provided prompts. This paper presents SymRTLO, a novel neuron-symbolic RTL optimization framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-based code rewriting with symbolic reasoning techniques. Our method incorporates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system of optimization rules and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based templates, enabling LLM-based rewriting that maintains syntactic correctness while minimizing undesired circuit behaviors. A symbolic module is proposed for analyzing and optimizing finite state machine (FSM) logic, allowing fine-grained state merging and partial specification handling beyond the scope of pattern-based compilers. Furthermore, a fast verification pipeline, combining formal equivalence checks with test-driven validation, further reduces the complexity of verification. Experiments on the RTL-Rewriter benchmark with Synopsys Design Compiler and Yosys show that SymRTLO improves power, performance, and area (PPA) by up to 43.9%, 62.5%, and 51.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10369v1
Complete Fusion for Stateful Streams: Equational Theory of Stateful   Streams and Fusion as Normalization-by-Evaluation,"Processing large amounts of data fast, in constant and small space is the point of stream processing and the reason for its increasing use. Alas, the most performant, imperative processing code tends to be almost impossible to read, let alone modify, reuse -- or write correctly.   We present both a stream compilation theory and its implementation as a portable stream processing library Strymonas that lets us assemble complex stream pipelines just by plugging in simple combinators, and yet attain the performance of hand-written imperative loops and state machines. The library supports finite and infinite streams and offers a rich set of combinators: from map, filter, take(while) to flat-map (nesting), zip, map-accumulate and sliding windowing. The combinators may be freely composed, and yet the resulting convoluted imperative code contains no traces of combinator abstractions: no closures, intermediate objects or tuples. The high-performance is portable and statically guaranteed, without relying on compiler or black-box optimizations. We greatly exceed in performance the available stream processing libraries in OCaml.   The library exists in two versions, OCaml and Scala 3, and supports pluggable backends for code generation (currently: C, OCaml and Scala).   Strymonas has been developed in tandem with the equational theory of stateful streams. Our theoretical model can represent all desired pipelines and also guarantees the existence of unique normal forms, which are mappable to (fused) state machines. We describe the normalization algorithm, as a form of normalization-by-evaluation. Stream pipeline compilation and optimization are represented as normalization, and are hence deterministic and terminating, with the guaranteed outcome. The equational theory lets us state and prove the correctness of the complete fusion optimization.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15768v1
Logical Relations for Formally Verified Authenticated Data Structures,"Authenticated data structures allow untrusted third parties to carry out operations which produce proofs that can be used to verify an operation's output. Such data structures are challenging to develop and implement correctly. This paper gives a formal proof of security and correctness for a library that generates authenticated versions of data structures automatically. The proof is based on a new relational separation logic for reasoning about programs that use collision-resistant cryptographic hash functions. This logic provides a basis for constructing two semantic models of a type system, which are used to justify how the library makes use of type abstraction to enforce security and correctness. Using these models, we also prove the correctness of several optimizations to the library and then show how optimized, hand-written implementations of authenticated data structures can be soundly linked with automatically generated code. All of the results in this paper have been mechanized in the Coq proof assistant using the Iris framework.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10802v1
Annotation-guided AoS-to-SoA conversions and GPU offloading with data   views in C++,"The C++ programming language provides classes and structs as fundamental modeling entities. Consequently, C++ code tends to favour array-of-structs (AoS) for encoding data sequences, even though structure-of-arrays (SoA) yields better performance for some calculations. We propose a C++ language extension based on attributes that allows developers to guide the compiler in selecting memory arrangements, i.e.~to select the optimal choice between AoS and SoA dynamically depending on both the execution context and algorithm step. The compiler can then automatically convert data into the preferred format prior to the calculations and convert results back afterward. The compiler handles all the complexity of determining which data to convert and how to manage data transformations. Our implementation realises the compiler-extension for the new annotations in Clang and demonstrates their effectiveness through a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code, which we evaluate on an Intel CPU, an ARM CPU, and a Grace-Hopper GPU. While the separation of concerns between data structure and operators is elegant and provides performance improvements, the new annotations do not eliminate the need for performance engineering. Instead, they challenge conventional performance wisdom and necessitate rethinking approaches how to write efficient implementations.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16517v1
A Program Logic for Under-approximating Worst-case Resource Usage,"Understanding and predicting the worst-case resource usage is crucial for software quality; however, existing methods either over-approximate with potentially loose bounds or under-approximate without asymptotic guarantees. This paper presents a program logic to under-approximate worst-case resource usage, adapting incorrectness logic (IL) to reason quantitatively about resource consumption. We propose quantitative forward and backward under-approximate (QFUA and QBUA) triples, which generalize IL to identify execution paths leading to high resource usage. We also introduce a variant of QBUA that supports reasoning about high-water marks. Our logic is proven sound and complete with respect to a simple IMP-like language, and we demonstrate its utility through case studies involving arrays, pointers, and procedure calls.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11091v1
Expressivity of AuDaLa: Turing Completeness and Possible Extensions,"AuDaLa is a recently introduced programming language that follows the new data autonomous paradigm. In this paradigm, small pieces of data execute functions autonomously. Considering the paradigm and the design choices of AuDaLa, it is interesting to determine the expressiveness of the language and to create verification methods for it. In this paper, we implement Turing machines in AuDaLa and prove that implementation correct. This proves that AuDaLa is Turing complete, giving an initial indication of AuDaLa's expressiveness, and by proving the implementation correct this contributes to the creation of verification methods for AuDaLa. Additionally, we give examples of how to add in possible extensions for AuDaLa to increase its expressivity to better match conventional parallel languages, allowing for a smoother and more performant implementation of algorithms.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14938v1

Despite its advantages, challenges persist in standardizing and implementing programming education effectively across both the higher and secondary education levels in Brazil. To shed light on these issues, we carried out a systematic review of programming teaching methods in the Brazilian context, examining gaps, common techniques, approaches, and action opportunities in programming education. Our findings provide valuable recommendations for educational policymakers and educators to develop effective and updated national policies to teach programming.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17278v1
"Efficiency of Analysis of Transitive Relations using Query-Driven,   Ground-and-Solve, and Fact-Driven Inference","Logic rules allow analysis of complex relationships, especially including transitive relations, to be expressed easily and clearly. Rule systems allow queries using such rules to be done automatically. It is well known that rule systems using different inference methods can have very different efficiency on the same rules and queries. In fact, different variants of rules and queries expressing the same relationships can have more drastically different efficiency in the same rule system. Many other differences can also cause differences in efficiency. What exactly are the differences? Can we capture them exactly and predict efficiency precisely? What are the best systems to use?   This paper analyzes together the efficiency of all three types of well-known inference methods -- query-driven, ground-and-solve, and fact-driven -- with optimizations, and compares with optimal complexities for the first time, especially for analyzing transitive relations. We also experiment with rule systems widely considered to have best performances for each type. We analyze all well-known variants of the rules and examine a wide variety of input relationship graphs. Our results include precisely calculated optimal time complexities; exact explanations and comparisons across different inference methods, rule variants, and graph types; confirmation with detailed measurements from performance experiments; and answers to the key questions above.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21291v1
Malicious and Unintentional Disclosure Risks in Large Language Models   for Code Generation,"This paper explores the risk that a large language model (LLM) trained for code generation on data mined from software repositories will generate content that discloses sensitive information included in its training data. We decompose this risk, known in the literature as ``unintended memorization,'' into two components: unintentional disclosure (where an LLM presents secrets to users without the user seeking them out) and malicious disclosure (where an LLM presents secrets to an attacker equipped with partial knowledge of the training data). We observe that while existing work mostly anticipates malicious disclosure, unintentional disclosure is also a concern. We describe methods to assess unintentional and malicious disclosure risks side-by-side across different releases of training datasets and models. We demonstrate these methods through an independent assessment of the Open Language Model (OLMo) family of models and its Dolma training datasets. Our results show, first, that changes in data source and processing are associated with substantial changes in unintended memorization risk; second, that the same set of operational changes may increase one risk while mitigating another; and, third, that the risk of disclosing sensitive information varies not only by prompt strategies or test datasets but also by the types of sensitive information. These contributions rely on data mining to enable greater privacy and security testing required for the LLM training data supply chain.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22760v1
AI-Mediated Code Comment Improvement,"This paper describes an approach to improve code comments along different quality axes by rewriting those comments with customized Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based tools. We conduct an empirical study followed by grounded theory qualitative analysis to determine the quality axes to improve. Then we propose a procedure using a Large Language Model (LLM) to rewrite existing code comments along the quality axes. We implement our procedure using GPT-4o, then distil the results into a smaller model capable of being run in-house, so users can maintain data custody. We evaluate both our approach using GPT-4o and the distilled model versions. We show in an evaluation how our procedure improves code comments along the quality axes. We release all data and source code in an online repository for reproducibility.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09021v1
Bottom-Up Generation of Verilog Designs for Testing EDA Tools,"Testing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools rely on benchmarks -- designs written in Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) such as Verilog, SystemVerilog, or VHDL. Although collections of benchmarks for these languages exist, they are typically limited in size. This scarcity has recently drawn more attention due to the increasing need for training large language models in this domain. To deal with such limitation, this paper presents a methodology and a corresponding tool for generating realistic Verilog designs. The tool, ChiGen, was originally developed to test the Jasper\textregistered\ Formal Verification Platform, a product by Cadence Design Systems. Now, released as open-source software, ChiGen has been able to identify zero-day bugs in a range of tools, including Verible, Verilator, and Yosys. This paper outlines the principles behind ChiGen's design, focusing on three aspects of it: (i) generation guided by probabilistic grammars, (ii) type inference via the Hindley-Milner algorithm, and (iii) code injection enabled by data-flow analysis. Once deployed on standard hardware, ChiGen outperforms existing Verilog Fuzzers such as Verismith, TransFuzz, and VlogHammer regarding structural diversity, code coverage, and bug-finding ability.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06295v1
Rod Bustall: In Memoriam,"This is an obituary of Rod Burstall, written in his honour. Rod was a prominent computer scientist whose contributions span over forty years. Most of his career was spent at Edinburgh University. He lead the team programming Freddy, the first hand-eye assembly robot, with much of his effort being devoted to the development of the POP-2 programming language. He became interested in a mathematical approach to software development: he recognised the central role of structural induction; his work on reasoning about mutable data structures was an influential precursor of separation logic; he was the first to point out the connection between program proof and modal logic; and he was responsible for the idea that stores are mappings from locations to their contents.   As part of his quest for correctness of programs, Rod, with John Darlington, undertook the first major work on program transformation. His interest in novel programming languages continued with the experimental language HOPE, developed with Don Sannella and David MacQueen. Robin Milner's Standard ML and its relatives integrated ideas from Hope, and Rod was an active member of the Standard ML design team. Rod pioneered the use of algebraic and categorical techniques in programming. He and Joseph Goguen proposed the first algebraic specification language. Rod was an early user of categorical ideas, in particular developing computational category theory with David Rydeheard.   The interplay between programming and correctness proofs is again evident in Rod's contributions to automated proof support systems. For example, he led Randy Pollack, Zhaohui Luo, and others in the Lego proof assistant, which implemented type systems supporting interactive proof development. Finally, Rod, with James McKinna, investigated notions of programs packaged with proofs of their correctness, anticipating the topic of proof-carrying code.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06456v1
Portability of Optimizations from SC to TSO,"It is well recognized that the safety of compiler optimizations is at risk in a concurrent context. Existing approaches primarily rely on context-free thread-local guarantees, and prohibit optimizations that introduce a data-race. However, compilers utilize global context-specific information, exposing safe optimizations that may violate such guarantees as well as introduce a race. Such optimizations need to individually be proven safe for each language model. An alternate approach to this would be proving them safe for an intuitive model (like interleaving semantics), and then determine their portability across other concurrent models. In this paper, we address this problem of porting across models of concurrency. We first identify a global guarantee on optimizations portable from Sequential Consistency (SC) to Total Store Order (TSO). Our guarantee is in the form of constraints specifying the syntactic changes an optimization must not incur. We then show these constraints correlate to prohibiting the introduction of triangular races, a subset of data-race relevant to TSO. We conclude by showing how such race inducing optimizations relate to porting across Strong Release Acquire (SRA), a known causally consistent memory model.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17646v1
Automated Discovery of Tactic Libraries for Interactive Theorem Proving,"Enabling more concise and modular proofs is essential for advancing formal reasoning using interactive theorem provers (ITPs). Since many ITPs, such as Rocq and Lean, use tactic-style proofs, learning higher-level custom tactics is crucial for proof modularity and automation. This paper presents a novel approach to tactic discovery, which leverages Tactic Dependence Graphs (TDGs) to identify reusable proof strategies across multiple proofs. TDGs capture logical dependencies between tactic applications while abstracting away irrelevant syntactic details, allowing for both the discovery of new tactics and the refactoring of existing proofs into more modular forms. We have implemented this technique in a tool called TacMiner and compare it against an anti-unification-based approach Peano to tactic discovery. Our evaluation demonstrates that TacMiner can learn 3x as many tactics as Peano and reduces the size of proofs by 26% across all benchmarks. Furthermore, our evaluation demonstrates the benefits of learning custom tactics for proof automation, allowing a state-of-the-art proof automation tool to achieve a relative increase of 172% in terms of success rate.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24036v1
Categorical Semantics of Higher-Order Message Passing,"The Categorical Message Passing Language (CaMPL) is a concurrent programming language with a categorical semantics based on a linear actegory. CaMPL has a sequential and a concurrent side. The sequential side is a functional-style programming language which has a linear actegorical action on the concurrent side to produce a semantics for message passing. Concurrent processes in CaMPL talk to each other along typed channels (or protocols). The typed channels of each CaMPL process are split into input and output polarity channels, allowing processes to be plugged together by connecting an output polarity channel of one process to an input polarity channel of another (provided the channels are of the same protocol). Channel polarities can be flipped input to output with a linear logic-style negation. A desirable feature of a concurrent message-passing language, such as CaMPL, is that it should support higher-order processes. This allows processes to be passed as first-class citizens between processes. While the ability to pass concurrent processes is already present in any closed linear type system-such as CaMPL's-supporting arbitrary recursive process definitions requires reusing passed processes. Concurrent resources in CaMPL cannot be duplicated, thus, passing processes as linear closures does not provide the required flexibility. Instead, processes must be passed as sequential data, and the concurrent side must be enriched in the sequential side. This paper concerns the categorical semantics that lets us store concurrent processes as sequential data and yet use them. Abstractly, this is given by the equivalence between an actegory with hom-objects and an enriched category with copowers. In the closed symmetric case, this was studied by Kelly and Janelidze. Here, we present the proof of this equivalence for the non-symmetric, non-closed case in detail.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19305v1
MappedTrace: Tracing Pointer Remotely with Compiler-generated Maps,"Existing precise pointer tracing methods introduce substantial runtime overhead to the program being traced and are applicable only at specific program execution points. We propose MappedTrace that leverages compiler-generated read-only maps to accurately identify all pointers in any given snapshot of a program's execution state. The maps record the locations and types of pointers, allowing the tracer to precisely identify pointers without requiring the traced program to maintain bookkeeping data structures or poll at safe points, thereby reducing runtime overhead. By running the tracer from a different address space or machine, MappedTrace presents new opportunities to improve memory management techniques like memory leak detection and enables novel use cases such as infinite memory abstraction for resource-constrained environments.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10668v1
Nanopass Back-Translation of Call-Return Trees for Mechanized Secure   Compilation Proofs,"Researchers aim to build secure compilation chains enforcing that if there is no attack a source context can mount against a source program then there is also no attack an adversarial target context can mount against the compiled program. Proving that these compilation chains are secure is, however, challenging, and involves a non-trivial back-translation step: for any attack a target context mounts against the compiled program one has to exhibit a source context mounting the same attack against the source program. We describe a novel back-translation technique, which results in simpler proofs that can be more easily mechanized in a proof assistant. Given a finite set of finite trace prefixes, capturing the interaction recorded during an attack between a target context and the compiled program, we build a call-return tree that we back-translate into a source context producing the same trace prefixes. We use state in the generated source context to record the current location in the call-return tree. The back-translation is done in several small steps, each adding to the tree new information describing how the location should change depending on how the context regains control. To prove this back-translation correct we give semantics to every intermediate call-return tree language, using ghost state to store information and explicitly enforce execution invariants. We prove several small forward simulations, basically seeing the back-translation as a verified nanopass compiler. Thanks to this modular structure, we are able to mechanize this complex back-translation and its correctness proof in the Rocq prover without too much effort.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19609v2

A Critical Examination of Floyd's   Appropriation of Kuhn's Philosophy,"This paper examines the philosophical relationship between Thomas Kuhn's concept of scientific paradigms and the programming paradigm concept in computing that was introduced by Floyd in his 1978 Turing Award lecture. Through critical analysis of both Kuhn's original framework and its application in computing, we argue that the contemporary usage of `programming paradigms' represents a significant departure from Kuhn's philosophical concept. We demonstrate that while Floyd explicitly attributed this term to Kuhn's work, his usage fundamentally altered the concept's meaning. We argue that this divergence necessitates a critical reassessment of the term's usage in computing discourse.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01901v1
Micro-Patterns in Solidity Code,"Solidity is the predominant programming language for blockchain-based smart contracts, and its characteristics pose significant challenges for code analysis and maintenance. Traditional software analysis approaches, while effective for conventional programming languages, often fail to address Solidity-specific features such as gas optimization and security constraints.   This paper introduces micro-patterns - recurring, small-scale design structures that capture key behavioral and structural peculiarities specific to a language - for Solidity language and demonstrates their value in understanding smart contract development practices. We identified 18 distinct micro-patterns organized in five categories (Security, Functional, Optimization, Interaction, and Feedback), detailing their characteristics to enable automated detection.   To validate this proposal, we analyzed a dataset of 23258 smart contracts from five popular blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Fantom and Optimism). Our analysis reveals widespread adoption of micro-patterns, with 99% of contracts implementing at least one pattern and an average of 2.76 patterns per contract. The Storage Saver pattern showed the highest adoption (84.62% mean coverage), while security patterns demonstrated platform-specific adoption rates. Statistical analysis revealed significant platform-specific differences in pattern adoption, particularly in Borrower, Implementer, and Storage Optimization patterns.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01282v1
Constant Optimization Driven Database System Testing,"Logic bugs are bugs that can cause database management systems (DBMSs) to silently produce incorrect results for given queries. Such bugs are severe, because they can easily be overlooked by both developers and users, and can cause applications that rely on the DBMSs to malfunction. In this work, we propose Constant-Optimization-Driven Database Testing (CODDTest) as a novel approach for detecting logic bugs in DBMSs. This method draws inspiration from two well-known optimizations in compilers: constant folding and constant propagation. Our key insight is that for a certain database state and query containing a predicate, we can apply constant folding on the predicate by replacing an expression in the predicate with a constant, anticipating that the results of this predicate remain unchanged; any discrepancy indicates a bug in the DBMS. We evaluated CODDTest on five mature and extensively-tested DBMSs-SQLite, MySQL, CockroachDB, DuckDB, and TiDB-and found 45 unique, previously unknown bugs in them. Out of these, 24 are unique logic bugs. Our manual analysis of the state-of-the-art approaches indicates that 11 logic bugs are detectable only by CODDTest. We believe that CODDTest is easy to implement, and can be widely adopted in practice.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11252v1

OSVBench: Benchmarking LLMs on Specification Generation Tasks for   Operating System Verification,"We introduce OSVBench, a new benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating complete specification code pertaining to operating system kernel verification tasks. The benchmark first defines the specification generation problem into a program synthesis problem within a confined scope of syntax and semantics by providing LLMs with the programming model. The LLMs are required to understand the provided verification assumption and the potential syntax and semantics space to search for, then generate the complete specification for the potentially buggy operating system code implementation under the guidance of the high-level functional description of the operating system. This benchmark is built upon a real-world operating system kernel, Hyperkernel, and consists of 245 complex specification generation tasks in total, each is a long context task of about 20k-30k tokens. Our comprehensive evaluation of 12 LLMs exhibits the limited performance of the current LLMs on the specification generation tasks for operating system verification. Significant disparities in their performance on the benchmark highlight differences in their ability to handle long-context code generation tasks. The evaluation toolkit and benchmark are available at https://github.com/lishangyu-hkust/OSVBench.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20964v1
VeriFast's separation logic: a higher-order(ish) logic without laters   for modular verification of fine-grained concurrent programs,"VeriFast is one of the leading tools for semi-automated modular formal program verification. A central feature of VeriFast is its support for higher-order ghost code, which enables its support for expressively specifying fine-grained concurrent modules, without the need for a later modality. We present the first formalization and soundness proof for this aspect of VeriFast's logic.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04500v1
Comprehensive Verification of Packet Processing,"To prove the functional correctness of a P4 program running in a programmable network switch or smart NIC, prior works have focused mainly on verifiers for the ""control block"" (match-action pipeline). But to verify that a switch handles packets according to a desired specification, proving the control block is not enough. We demonstrate a new comprehensive framework for formally specifying and proving the additional components of the switch that handle each packet: P4 parsers and deparsers, as well as non-P4 components such as multicast engines, packet generators, and resubmission paths. These are generally triggered by having the P4 program set header or metadata fields, which prompt other switch components -- fixed-function or configurable -- to execute the corresponding actions. Overall behavior is correct only if the ""configurable"" components are, indeed, configured properly; and we show how to prove that. We demonstrate our framework by verifying the correctness of packet-stream behavior in two classic P4 applications. Our framework is the first to allow the correctness proof of a P4 program to be composed with the correctness proof for these other switch components to verify that the switch programming as a whole accomplishes a specified behavior.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19908v1
Foundations for Deductive Verification of Continuous Probabilistic   Programs: From Lebesgue to Riemann and Back,"We lay out novel foundations for the computer-aided verification of guaranteed bounds on expected outcomes of imperative probabilistic programs featuring (i) general loops, (ii) continuous distributions, and (iii) conditioning. To handle loops we rely on user-provided quantitative invariants, as is well established. However, in the realm of continuous distributions, invariant verification becomes extremely challenging due to the presence of integrals in expectation-based program semantics. Our key idea is to soundly under- or over-approximate these integrals via Riemann sums. We show that this approach enables the SMT-based invariant verification for programs with a fairly general control flow structure. On the theoretical side, we prove convergence of our Riemann approximations, and establish coRE-completeness of the central verification problems. On the practical side, we show that our approach enables to use existing automated verifiers targeting discrete probabilistic programs for the verification of programs involving continuous sampling. Towards this end, we implement our approach in the recent quantitative verification infrastructure Caesar by encoding Riemann sums in its intermediate verification language. We present several promising case studies.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19388v1
"ScaMaha: A Tool for Parsing, Analyzing, and Visualizing Object-Oriented   Software Systems","Reverse engineering tools are required to handle the complexity of software products and the unique requirements of many different tasks, like software analysis and visualization. Thus, reverse engineering tools should adapt to a variety of cases. Static Code Analysis (SCA) is a technique for analyzing and exploring software source code without running it. Manual review of software source code puts additional effort on software developers and is a tedious, error-prone, and costly job. This paper proposes an original approach (called ScaMaha) for Object-Oriented (OO) source code analysis and visualization based on SCA. ScaMaha is a modular, flexible, and extensible reverse engineering tool. ScaMaha revolves around a new meta-model and a new code parser, analyzer, and visualizer. ScaMaha parser extracts software source code based on the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and stores this code as a code file. The code file includes all software code identifiers, relations, and structural information. ScaMaha analyzer studies and exploits the code files to generate useful information regarding software source code. The software metrics file gives unique metrics regarding software systems, such as the number of method access relations. Software source code visualization plays an important role in software comprehension. Thus, ScaMaha visualizer exploits code files to visualize different aspects of software source code. The visualizer generates unique graphs about software source code, like the visualization of inheritance relations. ScaMaha tool was applied to several case studies from small to large software systems, such as drawing shapes, mobile photo, health watcher, rhino, and ArgoUML. Results show the scalability, performance, soundness, and accuracy of ScaMaha tool. Evaluation metrics, such as precision and recall, demonstrate the accuracy of ScaMaha ...",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11001v1
Spatial Data Science Languages: commonalities and needs,"Recent workshops brought together several developers, educators and users of software packages extending popular languages for spatial data handling, with a primary focus on R, Python and Julia. Common challenges discussed included handling of spatial or spatio-temporal support, geodetic coordinates, in-memory vector data formats, data cubes, inter-package dependencies, packaging upstream libraries, differences in habits or conventions between the GIS and physical modelling communities, and statistical models. The following set of insights have been formulated: (i) considering software problems across data science language silos helps to understand and standardise analysis approaches, also outside the domain of formal standardisation bodies; (ii) whether attribute variables have block or point support, and whether they are spatially intensive or extensive has consequences for permitted operations, and hence for software implementing those; (iii) handling geometries on the sphere rather than on the flat plane requires modifications to the logic of {\em simple features}, (iv) managing communities and fostering diversity is a necessary, on-going effort, and (v) tools for cross-language development need more attention and support.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16686v1
Example-Free Learning of Regular Languages with Prefix Queries,"Language learning refers to the problem of inferring a mathematical model which accurately represents a formal language. Many language learning algorithms learn by asking certain types of queries about the language being modeled. Language learning is of practical interest in the field of cybersecurity, where it is used to model the language accepted by a program's input parser (also known as its input processor). In this setting, a learner can only query a string of its choice by executing the parser on it, which limits the language learning algorithms that can be used. Most practical parsers can indicate not only whether the string is valid or not, but also where the parsing failed. This extra information can be leveraged into producing a type of query we call the prefix query. Notably, no existing language learning algorithms make use of prefix queries, though some ask membership queries i.e., they ask whether or not a given string is valid. When these approaches are used to learn the language of a parser, the prefix information provided by the parser remains unused.   In this work, we present PL*, the first known language learning algorithm to make use of the prefix query, and a novel modification of the classical L* algorithm. We show both theoretically and empirically that PL* is able to learn more efficiently than L* due to its ability to exploit the additional information given by prefix queries over membership queries. Furthermore, we show how PL* can be used to learn the language of a parser, by adapting it to a more practical setting in which prefix queries are the only source of information available to it; that is, it does not have access to any labelled examples or any other types of queries. We demonstrate empirically that, even in this more constrained setting, PL* is still capable of accurately learning a range of languages of practical interest.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02170v1
The B2Scala Tool: Integrating Bach in Scala with Security in Mind,"Process algebras have been widely used to verify security protocols in a formal manner. However they mostly focus on synchronous communication based on the exchange of messages. We present an alternative approach relying on asynchronous communication obtained through information available on a shared space. More precisely this paper first proposes an embedding in Scala of a Linda-like language, called Bach. It consists of a Domain Specific Language, internal to Scala, that allows us to experiment programs developed in Bach while benefiting from the Scala eco-system, in particular from its type system as well as program fragments developed in Scala. Moreover, we introduce a logic that allows to restrict the executions of programs to those meeting logic formulae. Our work is illustrated on the Needham-Schroeder security protocol, for which we manage to automatically rediscover the man-in-the-middle attack first put in evidence by G. Lowe.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08235v1
MiniF2F in Rocq: Automatic Translation Between Proof Assistants -- A   Case Study,"In this work, we conduct an experiment using state-of-the-art LLMs to translate MiniF2F into Rocq. The translation task focuses on generating a Rocq theorem based on three sources: a natural language description, the Lean formalization, and the Isabelle formalization. We conducted our experiment in 3 stages of increasing complexity, from basic one-shot prompting to multi-turn conversations that incorporate feedback from unsuccessful attempts. At each stage, we perform multiple rounds of translation using increasingly advanced models: GPT-4o mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, o1 mini, and o1. We successfully translated 478 out of 488 theorems. The dataset is opensource: https://github.com/LLM4Rocq/miniF2F-rocq.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04763v1
Type-safe and portable support for packed data,"When components of a system exchange data, they need to serialise the data so that it can be sent over the network. Then, the recipient has to deserialise the data in order to be able to process it. These steps take time and have an impact on the overall system's performance.   A solution to this is to use packed data, which has a unified representation between the memory and the network, removing the need for any marshalling steps. Additionally, using this data representation can improve the program's performance thanks to the data locality enabled by the compact representation of the data in memory. Unfortunately, no mainstream programming languages support packed data, whether it's out-of-the-box or through a compiler extension.   We present packed-data, a Haskell library that allows for type safe building and reading of packed data in a functional style. The library does not rely on compiler modifications, making it portable, and leverages meta-programming to allow programmers to pack their own data types effortlessly.   We evaluate the usability and performance of the library, and conclude that it allows traversing packed data up to 60% faster than unpacked data. We also reflect on how to enhance the performance of library-based support for packed data.   Our implementation approach is general and can easily be used with any programming languages that support higher-kinded types.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20166v1
PR2: Peephole Raw Pointer Rewriting with LLMs for Translating C to Safer   Rust,"There has been a growing interest in translating C code to Rust due to Rust's robust memory and thread safety guarantees. Tools such as C2RUST enable syntax-guided transpilation from C to semantically equivalent Rust code. However, the resulting Rust programs often rely heavily on unsafe constructs--particularly raw pointers--which undermines Rust's safety guarantees. This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs generated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a peephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual functions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs decision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process. Additionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors introduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during compilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and evaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show that PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these projects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code. On average, PR2 completes the transformation of a project in 5.44 hours, at an average cost of $1.46.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04852v2
Code Style Sheets: CSS for Code,"Program text is rendered using impoverished typographic styles. Beyond choice of fonts and syntax-highlighting colors, code editors and related tools utilize very few text decorations. These limited styles are, furthermore, applied in monolithic fashion, regardless of the programs and tasks at hand.   We present the notion of _code style sheets_ for styling program text. Motivated by analogy to cascading style sheets (CSS) for styling HTML documents, code style sheets provide mechanisms for defining rules to select elements from an abstract syntax tree (AST) in order to style their corresponding visual representation. Technically, our selector language generalizes essential constructs from CSS to a programming-language setting with algebraic data types (such as ASTs). Practically, code style sheets allow ASTs to be styled granularly, based on semantic information -- such as the structure of abstract syntax, static type information, and corresponding run-time values -- as well as design choices on the part of authors and readers of a program. Because programs are heavily nested in structure, a key aspect of our design is a layout algorithm that renders nested, multiline text blocks more compactly than in existing box-based layout systems such as HTML.   In this paper, we design and implement a code style sheets system for a subset of Haskell, using it to illustrate several code presentation and visualization tasks. These examples demonstrate that code style sheets provide a uniform framework for rendering programs in multivarious ways, which could be employed in future designs for text-based as well as structure editors.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09386v5
Handling the Selection Monad (Full Version),"The selection monad on a set consists of selection functions. These select an element from the set, based on a loss (dually, reward) function giving the loss resulting from a choice of an element. Abadi and Plotkin used the monad to model a language with operations making choices of computations taking account of the loss that would arise from each choice. However, their choices were optimal, and they asked if they could instead be programmer provided.   In this work, we present a novel design enabling programmers to do so. We present a version of algebraic effect handlers enriched by computational ideas inspired by the selection monad. Specifically, as well as the usual delimited continuations, our new kind of handlers additionally have access to choice continuations, that give the possible future losses. In this way programmers can write operations implementing optimisation algorithms that are aware of the losses arising from their possible choices.   We give an operational semantics for a higher-order model language $\lambda C$, and establish desirable properties including progress, type soundness, and termination for a subset with a mild hierarchical constraint on allowable operation types. We give this subset a selection monad denotational semantics, and prove soundness and adequacy results. We also present a Haskell implementation and give a variety of programming examples.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03890v1
Baking for Dafny: A CakeML Backend for Dafny,"Dafny is a verification-aware programming language that allows developers to formally specify their programs and prove them correct. Currently, a Dafny program is compiled in two steps: First, a backend translates the input program to a high-level target language like C# or Rust. Second, the translated program is compiled using the target language's toolchain. Recently, an intermediate representation (IR) has been added to Dafny that serves as input to new backends. At the time of writing, none of these steps are verified, resulting in both the backend and the target language's toolchain being part of Dafny's trusted computing base (TCB). To reduce Dafny's TCB, we started developing a new backend that translates Dafny to CakeML, a verified, bootstrapped subset of Standard ML, in the interactive theorem prover HOL4. We also started to define functional big-step semantics for the Dafny IR to prove correctness of the backend.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05111v1

Relational Programming with Foundation Models,"Foundation models have vast potential to enable diverse AI applications. The powerful yet incomplete nature of these models has spurred a wide range of mechanisms to augment them with capabilities such as in-context learning, information retrieval, and code interpreting. We propose Vieira, a declarative framework that unifies these mechanisms in a general solution for programming with foundation models. Vieira follows a probabilistic relational paradigm and treats foundation models as stateless functions with relational inputs and outputs. It supports neuro-symbolic applications by enabling the seamless combination of such models with logic programs, as well as complex, multi-modal applications by streamlining the composition of diverse sub-models. We implement Vieira by extending the Scallop compiler with a foreign interface that supports foundation models as plugins. We implement plugins for 12 foundation models including GPT, CLIP, and SAM. We evaluate Vieira on 9 challenging tasks that span language, vision, and structured and vector databases. Our evaluation shows that programs in Vieira are concise, can incorporate modern foundation models, and have comparable or better accuracy than competitive baselines.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14515v1
Neural Network Verification is a Programming Language Challenge,"Neural network verification is a new and rapidly developing field of research.

Semantic foundations of equality saturation,"Equality saturation is an emerging technique for program and query optimization developed in the programming language community. It performs term rewriting over an E-graph, a data structure that compactly represents a program space. Despite its popularity, the theory of equality saturation lags behind the practice. In this paper, we define a fixpoint semantics of equality saturation based on tree automata and uncover deep connections between equality saturation and the chase. We characterize the class of chase sequences that correspond to equality saturation. We study the complexities of terminations of equality saturation in three cases: single-instance, all-term-instance, and all-E-graph-instance. Finally, we define a syntactic criterion based on acyclicity that implies equality saturation termination.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02413v1
Iso-Recursive Multiparty Sessions and their Automated Verification --   Technical Report,"Most works on session types take an equi-recursive approach and do not distinguish among a recursive type and its unfolding. This becomes more important in recent type systems which do not require global types, also known as generalised multiparty session types (GMST). In GMST, in order to establish properties as deadlock-freedom, the environments which type processes are assumed to satisfy extensional properties holding in all infinite sequences. This is a problem because: (1) the mechanisation of GMST and equi-recursion in proof assistants is utterly complex and eventually requires co-induction; and (2) the implementation of GMST in type checkers relies on model checkers for environment verification, and thus the program analysis is not self-contained.   In this paper, we overcome these limitations by providing an iso-recursive typing system that computes the behavioural properties of environments. The type system relies on a terminating function named compliance that computes all final redexes of an environment, and determines when these redexes do not contain mismatches or deadlocks: compliant environments cannot go wrong. The function is defined theoretically by introducing the novel notions of deterministic LTS of environments and of environment closure, and can be implemented in mainstream programming languages and compilers. We showcase an implementation in OCaml by using exception handling to tackle the inherent non-determinism of synchronisation of branching and selection types. We assess that the implementation provides the desired properties, namely absence of mismatches and of deadlocks in environments, by resorting to automated deductive verification performed in tools of the OCaml ecosystem relying on Why3.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17778v1
eqsat: An Equality Saturation Dialect for Non-destructive Rewriting,"With recent algorithmic improvements and easy-to-use libraries, equality saturation is being picked up for hardware design, program synthesis, theorem proving, program optimization, and more. Existing work on using equality saturation for program optimization makes use of external equality saturation libraries such as egg, typically generating a single optimized expression. In the context of a compiler, such an approach uses equality saturation to replace a small number of passes. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that represents equality saturation natively in the compiler's intermediate representation, facilitating the application of constructive compiler passes that maintain the e-graph state throughout the compilation flow. We take LLVM's MLIR framework and propose a new MLIR dialect named eqsat that represents e-graphs in MLIR code. This not only provides opportunities to rethink e-matching and extraction techniques by orchestrating existing MLIR passes, such as common subexpression elimination, but also avoids translation overhead between the chosen e-graph library and MLIR. Our eqsat intermediate representation (IR) allows programmers to apply equality saturation on arbitrary domain-specific IRs using the same flow as other compiler transformations in MLIR.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09363v2
Establishing tool support for a concept DSL,"The quality of software products tends to correlate with the quality of the abstractions adopted early in the design process. Acknowledging this tendency has led to the development of various tools and methodologies for modeling systems thoroughly before implementing them. However, creating effective abstract models of domain problems is difficult, especially if the models are also expected to exhibit qualities such as intuitiveness, being seamlessly integrable with other models, or being easily translatable into code.   This thesis describes Conceptual, a DSL for modeling the behavior of software systems using self-contained and highly reusable units of functionally known as concepts. The language's syntax and semantics are formalized based on previous work. Additionally, the thesis proposes a strategy for mapping language constructs from Conceptual into the Alloy modeling language. The suggested strategy is then implemented with a simple compiler, allowing developers to access and utilize Alloy's existing analysis tools for program reasoning.   The utility and expressiveness of Conceptual is demonstrated qualitatively through several practical case studies. Using the implemented compiler, a few erroneous specifications are identified in the literature. Moreover, the thesis establishes preliminary tool support in the Visual Studio Code IDE.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05849v1
Bialgebraic Reasoning on Stateful Languages,"Reasoning about program equivalence in imperative languages is notoriously challenging, as the presence of states (in the form of variable stores) fundamentally increases the observational power of program terms. The key desideratum for any notion of equivalence is compositionality, guaranteeing that subprograms can be safely replaced by equivalent subprograms regardless of the context. To facilitate compositionality proofs and avoid boilerplate work, one would hope to employ the abstract bialgebraic methods provided by Turi and Plotkin's powerful theory of mathematical operational semantics (a.k.a. abstract GSOS) or its recent extension by Goncharov et al. to higher-order languages. However, multiple attempts to apply abstract GSOS to stateful languages have thus failed. We propose a novel approach to the operational semantics of stateful languages based on the formal distinction between readers (terms that expect an initial input store before being executed), and writers (running terms that have already been provided with a store). In contrast to earlier work, this style of semantics is fully compatible with abstract GSOS, and we can thus leverage the existing theory to obtain coinductive reasoning techniques. We demonstrate that our approach generates non-trivial compositionality results for stateful languages with first-order and higher-order store and that it flexibly applies to program equivalences at different levels of granularity, such as trace, cost, and natural equivalence.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10955v1
Effective LLM-Driven Code Generation with Pythoness,"The advent of large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for a new era of programming tools with both significant capabilities and risks, as the generated code lacks guarantees of correctness and reliability. Developers using LLMs currently face the difficult task of optimizing, integrating, and maintaining code generated by AI. We propose an embedded domain-specific language (DSL), Pythoness, to address those challenges. In Pythoness, developers program with LLMs at a higher level of abstraction. Rather than interacting directly with generated code, developers using Pythoness operate at the level of behavioral specifications when writing functions, classes, or an entire program. These specifications can take the form of unit tests and property-based tests, which may be expressed formally or in natural language. Guided by these specifications, Pythoness generates code that both passes the tests and can be continuously checked during execution. We posit that the Pythoness approach lets developers harness the full potential of LLMs for code generation while substantially mitigating their inherent risks. We describe our current prototype implementation of Pythoness and demonstrate that it can successfully leverage a combination of tests and code generation to yield higher quality code than specifications alone.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02138v1
Pattern Matching in AI Compilers and its Formalization (Extended   Version),"PyPM is a Python-based domain specific language (DSL) for building rewrite-based optimization passes on machine learning computation graphs. Users define individual optimizations by writing (a) patterns that match subgraphs of a computation graph and (b) corresponding rules which replace a matched subgraph with an optimized kernel. PyPM is distinguished from the many other DSLs for defining rewriting passes by its complex and novel pattern language which borrows concepts from logic programming. PyPM patterns can be recursive, nondeterminstic, and can require checking domain-specific constraints such as the shapes of tensors. The PyPM implementation is thus similarly complicated, consisting of thousands of lines of C++ code. In this paper, we present our work on building PyPM, as well as formalizing and distilling and this complexity to an understandable mathematical core. We have developed a formal core calculus expressing the main operations of the PyPM pattern language. We define both a declarative semantics - describing which patterns match which terms - and an algorithmic semantics - an idealized version of the PyPM pattern interpreter - and prove their equivalence.

HyperGraphOS: A Modern Meta-Operating System for the Scientific and   Engineering Domains,"This paper presents HyperGraphOS, a significant innovation in the domain of operating systems, specifically designed to address the needs of scientific and engineering domains. This platform aims to combine model-based engineering, graph modeling, data containers, and documents, along with tools for handling computational elements. HyperGraphOS functions as an Operating System offering to users an infinite workspace for creating and managing complex models represented as graphs with customizable semantics. By leveraging a web-based architecture, it requires only a modern web browser for access, allowing organization of knowledge, documents, and content into models represented in a network of workspaces. Elements of the workspace are defined in terms of domain-specific languages (DSLs). These DSLs are pivotal for navigating workspaces, generating code, triggering AI components, and organizing information and processes. The models' dual nature as both visual drawings and data structures allows dynamic modifications and inspections both interactively as well as programaticaly. We evaluated HyperGraphOS's efficiency and applicability across a large set of diverse domains, including the design and development of a virtual Avatar dialog system, a robotic task planner based on large language models (LLMs), a new meta-model for feature-based code development and many others.

Substructural Parametricity,"Ordered, linear, and other substructural type systems allow us to expose deep properties of programs at the syntactic level of types. In this paper, we develop a family of unary logical relations that allow us to prove consequences of parametricity for a range of substructural type systems. A key idea is to parameterize the relation by an algebra, which we exemplify with a monoid and commutative monoid to interpret ordered and linear type systems, respectively. We prove the fundamental theorem of logical relations and apply it to deduce extensional properties of inhabitants of certain types. Examples include demonstrating that the ordered types for list append and reversal are inhabited by exactly one function, as are types of some tree traversals. Similarly, the linear type of the identity function on lists is inhabited only by permutations of the input. Our most advanced example shows that the ordered type of the list fold function is inhabited only by the fold function.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03153v1
The Free Termination Property of Queries Over Time,"Building on prior work on distributed databases and the CALM Theorem, we define and study the question of free termination: in the absence of distributed coordination, what query properties allow nodes in a distributed (database) system to unilaterally terminate execution even though they may receive additional data or messages in the future? This completeness question is complementary to the soundness questions studied in the CALM literature. We also develop a new model based on semiautomata that allows us to bridge from the relational transducer model of the CALM papers to algebraic models that are popular among software engineers (e.g. CRDTs) and of increasing interest to database theory for datalog extensions and incremental view maintenance.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00222v1
Contrasting Deadlock-Free Session Processes (Extended Version),"Deadlock freedom is a crucial property for message-passing programs. Over the years, several different type systems for concurrent processes that ensure deadlock freedom have been proposed; this diversity raises the question of how they compare. We address this question, considering two type systems not covered in prior work: Kokke etal's HCP, a type system based on a linear logic with hypersequents, and Padovani's priority-based type system for asynchronous processes, dubbed P. Their distinctive features make formal comparisons relevant and challenging. Our findings are two-fold: (1) the hypersequent setting does not drastically change the class of deadlock-free processes induced by linear logic, and (2) we relate the classes of deadlock-free processes induced by HCP and P. We prove that our results hold under both synchronous and asynchronous communication. Our results provide new insights into the essential mechanisms involved in statically avoiding deadlocks in concurrency.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15845v2
Super-Linear Speedup by Generalizing Runtime Repeated Recursion   Unfolding in Prolog,"Runtime repeated recursion unfolding was recently introduced as a just-in-time program transformation strategy that can achieve super-linear speedup. So far, the method was restricted to single linear direct recursive rules in the programming language Constraint Handling Rules (CHR). In this companion paper, we generalize the technique to multiple recursion and to multiple recursive rules and provide an implementation of the generalized method in the logic programming language Prolog.   The basic idea of the approach is as follows: When a recursive call is encountered at runtime, the recursive rule is unfolded with itself and this process is repeated with each resulting unfolded rule as long as it is applicable to the current call. In this way, more and more recursive steps are combined into one recursive step. Then an interpreter applies these rules to the call starting from the most unfolded rule. For recursions which have sufficiently simplifyable unfoldings, a super-linear can be achieved, i.e. the time complexity is reduced.   We implement an unfolder, a generalized meta-interpreter and a novel round-robin rule processor for our generalization of runtime repeated recursion unfolding with just ten clauses in Prolog. We illustrate the feasibility of our technique with worst-case time complexity estimates and benchmarks for some basic classical algorithms that achieve a super-linear speedup.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10416v1
Enhanced Data Race Prediction Through Modular Reasoning,"There are two orthogonal methodologies for efficient prediction of data races from concurrent program runs: commutativity and prefix reasoning. There are several instances of each methodology in the literature, with the goal of predicting data races using a streaming algorithm where the required memory does not grow proportional to the length of the observed run, but these instances were mostly created in an ad hoc manner, without much attention to their unifying underlying principles. In this paper, we identify and formalize these principles for each category with the ultimate goal of paving the way for combining them into a new algorithm which shares their efficiency characteristics but offers strictly more prediction power. In particular, we formalize three distinct classes of races predictable using commutativity reasoning, and compare them. We identify three different styles of prefix reasoning, and prove that they predict the same class of races, which provably contains all races predictable by any commutativity reasoning technique.   Our key contribution is combining prefix reasoning and commutativity reasoning in a modular way to introduce a new class of races, granular prefix races, that are predictable in constant-space and linear time, in a streaming fashion. This class of races includes all races predictable using commutativity and prefix reasoning techniques. We present an improved constant-space algorithm for prefix reasoning alone based on the idea of antichains (from language theory). This improved algorithm is the stepping stone that is required to devise an efficient algorithm for prediction of granular prefix races. We present experimental results to demonstrate the expressive power and performance of our new algorithm.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10813v1
Scalable and Accurate Application-Level Crash-Consistency Testing via   Representative Testing,"Crash consistency is essential for applications that must persist data. Crash-consistency testing has been commonly applied to find crash-consistency bugs in applications. The crash-state space grows exponentially as the number of operations in the program increases, necessitating techniques for pruning the search space. However, state-of-the-art crash-state space pruning is far from ideal. Some techniques look for known buggy patterns or bound the exploration for efficiency, but they sacrifice coverage and may miss bugs lodged deep within applications. Other techniques eliminate redundancy in the search space by skipping identical crash states, but they still fail to scale to larger applications.   In this work, we propose representative testing: a new crash-state space reduction strategy that achieves high scalability and high coverage. Our key observation is that the consistency of crash states is often correlated, even if those crash states are not identical. We build Pathfinder, a crash-consistency testing tool that implements an update behaviors-based heuristic to approximate a small set of representative crash states.   We evaluate Pathfinder on POSIX-based and MMIO-based applications, where it finds 18 (7 new) bugs across 8 production-ready systems. Pathfinder scales more effectively to large applications than prior works and finds 4x more bugs in POSIX-based applications and 8x more bugs in MMIO-based applications compared to state-of-the-art systems.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01390v1
RustSFQ: A Domain-Specific Language for SFQ Circuit Design,"Cell-based design of a single-flux-quantum (SFQ) digital circuit requires input-output consistency; every output signal must be consumed only once by the input of the following component, which is a unique constraint, unlike the traditional CMOS digital circuit design. While there are some cell libraries and simulation tools for SFQ circuit development, they do not verify the input-output consistency, and designers have significant responsibilities to ensure it manually. Additionally, designers have to carefully manage net names without unintended duplication and correct connectivity among nets in a netlist for simulations. We propose RustSFQ, a domain-specific language (DSL) embedded in Rust that automatically ensures the input-output consistency in the SFQ circuit by leveraging the ownership system of Rust. Each SFQ circuit element is represented as a function while wires are represented as instances, and the Rust compiler verifies that multiple elements do not share a single wire through the ownership system. Circuit descriptions in the RustSFQ are successfully compiled into low-level netlists for both analog and digital circuit simulations, and the DSL provides higher productivity than the conventional design flow. Using the RustSFQ, we developed an SFQ-based Reed-Solomon encoder with a 4-bit width for the first time as a case study. We confirmed that the circuit operated correctly at 10 GHz through circuit simulations.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11848v1
Flattening subtyping by eta expansion,"To design type systems that use subtyping, we have to make tradeoffs. Deep subtyping is more expressive than shallow subtyping, because deep subtyping compares the entire structure of types. However, shallow subtyping is easier to reason about. By eta-expanding source programs, we can get the effect of deep subtyping with less of its complexity. An early paper on filter models (Barendregt et al. 1983) examined two similar intersection type systems. The first included a subsumption rule that used a rich subtyping relation, including multiple rules for the top type and a distributivity rule. Their second type system dropped the subsumption rule, but added a rule that allowed a term to be eta-expanded before typing it. This rule in their second type system compensated for the lack of subsumption: where their first type system used subtyping to manipulate intersections deep inside types, their second type system used introduction and elimination rules directly on the subterms created by eta-expansion. Viewed as a computation, their proof of completeness for the second (shallow) system performs eta-expansion. Thus, we can regard their proof as inventing the application of eta-expansion to avoid deep subtyping. This paper serves as a tutorial on using eta-expansion to obviate deep subtyping, puts the invention of the technique by Barendregt et al. (1983) into context, gives a complete proof of the relevant lemma, and discusses how the technique can be used in type system design.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19053v1
An Overview of the Decentralized Reconfiguration Language Concerto-D   through its Maude Formalization,"We propose an overview of the decentralized reconfiguration language Concerto-D through its Maude formalization. Concerto-D extends the already published Concerto language. Concerto-D improves on two different parameters compared with related work: the decentralized coordination of numerous local reconfiguration plans which avoid a single point of failure when considering unstable networks such as edge computing, or cyber-physical systems (CPS) for instance; and a mechanized formal semantics of the language with Maude which offers guarantees on the executability of the semantics. Throughout the paper, the Concerto-D language and its semantics are exemplified with a reconfiguration extracted from a real case study on a CPS. We rely on the Maude formal specification language, which is based on rewriting logic, and consequently perfectly suited for describing a concurrent model.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08233v1
COMPASS: A Compiler Framework for Resource-Constrained Crossbar-Array   Based In-Memory Deep Learning Accelerators,"Recently, crossbar array based in-memory accelerators have been gaining interest due to their high throughput and energy efficiency. While software and compiler support for the in-memory accelerators has also been introduced, they are currently limited to the case where all weights are assumed to be on-chip. This limitation becomes apparent with the significantly increasing network sizes compared to the in-memory footprint.   Weight replacement schemes are essential to address this issue. We propose COMPASS, a compiler framework for resource-constrained crossbar-based processing-in-memory (PIM) deep neural network (DNN) accelerators. COMPASS is specially targeted for networks that exceed the capacity of PIM crossbar arrays, necessitating access to external memories. We propose an algorithm to determine the optimal partitioning that divides the layers so that each partition can be accelerated on chip. Our scheme takes into account the data dependence between layers, core utilization, and the number of write instructions to minimize latency, memory accesses, and improve energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that COMPASS can accommodate much more networks using a minimal memory footprint, while improving throughput by 1.78X and providing 1.28X savings in energy-delay product (EDP) over baseline partitioning methods.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06780v1
Validating Quantum State Preparation Programs,"One of the key steps in quantum algorithms is to prepare an initial quantum superposition state with different kinds of features. These so-called state preparation algorithms are essential to the behavior of quantum algorithms, and complicated state preparation algorithms are difficult to develop correctly and effectively. This paper presents Pqasm: a high-assurance framework implemented with the Coq proof assistant, allowing us to certify our Pqasm tool to correctly reflect quantum program behaviors. The key in the framework is to reduce the program correctness assurance of a program containing a quantum superposition state to the program correctness assurance for the program state without superposition. The reduction allows the development of an effective testing framework for testing quantum state preparation algorithm implementations on a classical computer - considered to be a hard problem with no clear solution until this point. We utilize the QuickChick property-based testing framework to test state preparation programs. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach over 5 case studies implemented using Pqasm; such cases are not even simulatable in the current quantum simulators.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05616v2
Two Approaches for Programming Education in the Domain of Graphics: An   Experiment,"Context: Graphics is a popular domain for teaching introductory programming in a motivating way, even in text-based programming languages. Over the last few decades, a large number of libraries using different approaches have been developed for this purpose.   Inquiry: Prior work in introductory programming that uses graphics as input and output has shown positive results in terms of engagement, but research is scarce on whether learners are able to use programming concepts learned through graphics for programming in other domains, transferring what they have learned.   Approach: We conducted a randomized, controlled experiment with 145 students as participants divided into two groups. Both groups programmed using graphics in Python, but used different approaches: one group used a compositional graphics library named PyTamaro; the other used the Turtle graphics library from Python's standard library. Student engagement was assessed with surveys, and programming knowledge with a post-test on general programming concepts and programming tasks in the domain of graphics.   Knowledge: We find few differences between the two groups on the post-test, despite the PyTamaro group having practiced on problems isomorphic to those in the post-test. The participants traced a compositional graphics program more accurately than a 'comparable' turtle graphics program. Both groups report high engagement and perceived learning; both perform well on simple program-writing tasks to create graphics.   Grounding: Our findings are based on a controlled experiment with a count of 145 participants, which exceeds the sample size indicated by power analysis to detect a medium effect size. The complete instrument and teaching materials used in the study are available as appendixes.   Importance: This study adds further evidence that graphics is an engaging domain for introductory programming; moreover, it shows that the compositional graphics approach adopted by PyTamaro yields engagement levels comparable to the venerable turtle approach. Compositional graphics code appears to be easier to trace than turtle graphics code. As for conceptual knowledge, our results indicate that practicing on programming tasks isomorphic to those of the test can still not be enough to achieve better transfer. This challenges programming educators and researchers to investigate further which graphics-based approaches work best and how to facilitate transfer.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20526v1
Functional Meaning for Parallel Streaming,"Nondeterminism introduced by race conditions and message reorderings makes parallel and distributed programming hard. Nevertheless, promising approaches such as LVars and CRDTs address this problem by introducing a partial order structure on shared state that describes how the state evolves over time. Monotone programs that respect the order are deterministic. Datalog-inspired languages incorporate this idea of monotonicity in a first-class way but they are not general-purpose. We would like parallel and distributed languages to be as natural to use as any functional language, without sacrificing expressivity, and with a formal basis of study as appealing as the lambda calculus.   This paper presents $\lambda_\vee$, a core language for deterministic parallelism that embodies the ideas above. In $\lambda_\vee$, values may increase over time according to a streaming order and all computations are monotone with respect to that order. The streaming order coincides with the approximation order found in Scott semantics and so unifies the foundations of functional programming with the foundations of deterministic distributed computation. The resulting lambda calculus has a computationally adequate model rooted in domain theory. It integrates the compositionality and power of abstraction characteristic of functional programming with the declarative nature of Datalog.   This version of the paper includes extended exposition and appendices with proofs.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02975v1
AutoPDL: Automatic Prompt Optimization for LLM Agents,"The performance of large language models (LLMs) depends on how they are prompted, with choices spanning both the high-level prompting pattern (e.g., Zero-Shot, CoT, ReAct, ReWOO) and the specific prompt content (instructions and few-shot demonstrations). Manually tuning this combination is tedious, error-prone, and non-transferable across LLMs or tasks. Therefore, this paper proposes AutoPDL, an automated approach to discover good LLM agent configurations. Our method frames this as a structured AutoML problem over a combinatorial space of agentic and non-agentic prompting patterns and demonstrations, using successive halving to efficiently navigate this space. We introduce a library implementing common prompting patterns using the PDL prompt programming language. AutoPDL solutions are human-readable, editable, and executable PDL programs that use this library. This approach also enables source-to-source optimization, allowing human-in-the-loop refinement and reuse. Evaluations across three tasks and six LLMs (ranging from 8B to 70B parameters) show consistent accuracy gains ($9.5\pm17.5$ percentage points), up to 68.9pp, and reveal that selected prompting strategies vary across models and tasks.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04365v1
GPU Performance Portability needs Autotuning,"As LLMs grow in complexity, achieving state-of-the-art performance requires tight co-design across algorithms, software, and hardware. Today's reliance on a single dominant platform limits portability, creates vendor lock-in, and raises barriers for new AI hardware. In this work, we make the case for combining just-in-time (JIT) compilation with kernel parameter autotuning to enable portable LLM inference with state-of-the-art performance without code changes. Focusing on flash attention -- a widespread performance critical LLM kernel -- we demonstrate that this approach explores up to 15x more kernel parameter configurations, produces significantly more diverse code across multiple dimensions, and even outperforms vendor-optimized implementations by up to 230%, all while reducing kernel code size by 70x and eliminating manual code optimizations. Our results highlight autotuning as a promising path to unlocking model portability across GPU vendors.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03780v2
debug-gym: A Text-Based Environment for Interactive Debugging,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for coding tasks, yet in most scenarios it is assumed that all relevant information can be either accessed in context or matches their training data. We posit that LLMs can benefit from the ability to interactively explore a codebase to gather the information relevant to their task. To achieve this, we present a textual environment, namely debug-gym, for developing LLM-based agents in an interactive coding setting. Our environment is lightweight and provides a preset of useful tools, such as a Python debugger (pdb), designed to facilitate an LLM-based agent's interactive debugging. Beyond coding and debugging tasks, this approach can be generalized to other tasks that would benefit from information-seeking behavior by an LLM agent.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21557v1
Enhancing Large Language Models for Hardware Verification: A Novel   SystemVerilog Assertion Dataset,"Hardware verification is crucial in modern SoC design, consuming around 70% of development time. SystemVerilog assertions ensure correct functionality. However, existing industrial practices rely on manual efforts for assertion generation, which becomes increasingly untenable as hardware systems become complex. Recent research shows that Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate this process. However, proprietary SOTA models like GPT-4o often generate inaccurate assertions and require expensive licenses, while smaller open-source LLMs need fine-tuning to manage HDL code complexities. To address these issues, we introduce **VERT**, an open-source dataset designed to enhance SystemVerilog assertion generation using LLMs. VERT enables researchers in academia and industry to fine-tune open-source models, outperforming larger proprietary ones in both accuracy and efficiency while ensuring data privacy through local fine-tuning and eliminating costly licenses. The dataset is curated by systematically augmenting variables from open-source HDL repositories to generate synthetic code snippets paired with corresponding assertions. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned models like Deepseek Coder 6.7B and Llama 3.1 8B outperform GPT-4o, achieving up to 96.88% improvement over base models and 24.14% over GPT-4o on platforms including OpenTitan, CVA6, OpenPiton and Pulpissimo.

Paradigm-Based Automatic HDL Code Generation Using LLMs,"While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate hardware description language (HDL) code for digital circuits, they still face the hallucination problem, which can result in the generation of incorrect HDL code or misinterpretation of specifications. In this work, we introduce a human-expert-inspired method to mitigate the hallucination of LLMs and enhance their performance in HDL code generation. We begin by constructing specialized paradigm blocks that consist of several steps designed to divide and conquer generation tasks, mirroring the design methodology of human experts. These steps include information extraction, human-like design flows, and the integration of external tools. LLMs are then instructed to classify the type of circuit in order to match it with the appropriate paradigm block and execute the block to generate the HDL codes. Additionally, we propose a two-phase workflow for multi-round generation, aimed at effectively improving the testbench pass rate of the generated HDL codes within a limited number of generation and verification rounds. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the functional correctness of the generated Verilog code",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12702v1
The Formal Semantics and Implementation of a Domain-Specific Language   for Mixed-Initiative Dialogs,"Human-computer dialog plays a prominent role in interactions conducted at kiosks (e.g., withdrawing money from an atm or filling your car with gas), on smartphones (e.g., installing and configuring apps), and on the web (e.g., booking a flight). Some human-computer dialogs involve an exchange of system-initiated and user-initiated actions. These dialogs are called *mixed-initiative dialogs* and sometimes also involve the pursuit of multiple interleaved sub-dialogs, which are woven together in a manner akin to coroutines. However, existing dialog-authoring languages have difficulty expressing these dialogs concisely. In this work, we improve the expressiveness of a dialog-authoring language we call *dialog specification language* (dsl), which is based on the programming concepts of functional application, partial function application, currying, and partial evaluation, by augmenting it with additional abstractions to support concise specification of task-based, mixed-initiative dialogs that resemble concurrently executing coroutines. We also formalize the semantics of dsl -- the process of simplifying and staging such dialogs specified in the language. We demonstrate that dialog specifications are compressed by to a higher degree when written in dsl using the new abstractions. We also operationalize the formal semantics of dsl in a Haskell functional programming implementation. The Haskell implementation of the simplification/staging rules provides a proof of concept that the formal semantics are sufficient to implement a dialog system specified with the language. We evaluate dsl from practical (i.e., case study), conceptual (i.e., comparisons to similar systems such as VoiceXML and State Chart XML), and theoretical perspectives. The practical applicability of the new language abstractions introduced in this work is demonstrated in a case study by using it to model portions of an online food ordering system that can be concurrently staged. Our results indicate that dsl enables concise representation of dialogs composed of multiple concurrent sub-dialogs and improves the compression of dialog expressions reported in prior research. We anticipate that the extension of our language and the formalization of the semantics can facilitate concise specification and smooth implementation of task-based, mixed-initiative, human-computer dialog systems across various domains such as atms and interactive, voice-response systems.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20529v1
Efficient Symbolic Execution of Software under Fault Attacks,"We propose a symbolic method for analyzing the safety of software under fault attacks both accurately and efficiently. Fault attacks leverage physically injected hardware faults to break the safety of a software program. While there are existing methods for analyzing the impact of faults on software, they suffer from inaccurate fault modeling and inefficient analysis algorithms. We propose two new techniques to overcome these problems. First, we propose a fault modeling technique that leverages program transformation to add symbolic variables to the program, to accurately model the fault-induced program behavior. Second, we propose a redundancy pruning technique that leverages the weakest precondition and fault saturation to mitigate path explosion, which is a performance bottleneck of symbolic execution that is exacerbated by the fault-induced program behavior. We have implemented the method and evaluated it on a variety of benchmark programs. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method. Specifically, it not only reveals many previously-missed safety violations but also reduces the running time drastically. Compared to the baseline, our optimized method is 2.0$\times$ faster on average.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15825v1
PRDTs: Composable Knowledge-Based Consensus Protocols with Replicated   Data Types,"Consensus protocols are fundamental in distributed systems as they enable software with strong consistency properties. However, designing optimized protocols for specific use-cases under certain system assumptions is typically a laborious and error-prone process requiring expert knowledge. While most recent optimized protocols are variations of well-known algorithms like Paxos or Raft, they often necessitate complete re-implementations, potentially introducing new bugs and complicating the application of existing verification results. This approach stands in the way of application-specific consistency protocols that can easily be amended or swapped out, depending on the given application and deployment scenario.   We propose Protocol Replicated Data Types (PRDTs), a novel programming model for implementing consensus protocols using replicated data types (RDTs). Inspired by the knowledge-based view of consensus, PRDTs employ RDTs to monotonically accumulate knowledge until agreement is reached. This approach allows for implementations focusing on high-level protocol logic with minimal network environment assumptions. Moreover, by applying existing algebraic composition techniques for RDTs in the PRDT context, we enable composable protocol building-blocks for implementing complex protocols. We present a formal model of our approach, demonstrate its application in PRDT-based implementations of existing protocols, and report empirical evaluation results. Our findings indicate that the PRDT approach offers enhanced flexibility and composability in protocol design, facilitates reasoning about correctness, and does not suffer from inherent performance limitations that would prevent its use in real-world applications.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05173v2
PolyVer: A Compositional Approach for Polyglot System Modeling and   Verification,"Several software systems are polyglot; that is, they comprise programs implemented in a combination of programming languages. Verifiers that directly run on mainstream programming languages are currently customized for single languages. Thus, to verify polyglot systems, one usually translates them into a common verification language or formalism on which the verifier runs. In this paper, we present an alternative approach, PolyVer, which employs abstraction, compositional reasoning, and synthesis to directly perform polyglot verification. PolyVer constructs a formal model of the original polyglot system as a transition system where the update functions associated with transitions are implemented in target languages such as C or Rust. To perform verification, PolyVer then connects a model checker for transition systems with language-specific verifiers (e.g., for C or Rust) using pre/post-condition contracts for the update functions. These contracts are automatically generated by synthesis oracles based on syntax-guided synthesis or large language models (LLMs), and checked by the language-specific verifiers. The contracts form abstractions of the update functions using which the model checker verifies the overall system-level property on the polyglot system model. PolyVer iterates between counterexample-guided abstraction-refinement (CEGAR) and counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) until the property is verified or a true system-level counterexample is found. We demonstrate the utility of PolyVer for verifying programs in the Lingua Franca polyglot language using the UCLID5 model checker connected with the CBMC and Kani verifiers for C and Rust respectively.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03207v2
Quantum Gate Decomposition: A Study of Compilation Time vs. Execution   Time Trade-offs,"Similar to classical programming, high-level quantum programming languages generate code that cannot be executed directly by quantum hardware and must be compiled. However, unlike classical code, quantum programs must be compiled before each execution, making the trade-off between compilation time and execution time particularly significant. In this paper, we address the first step of quantum compilation: multi-qubit gate decomposition. We analyze the trade-offs of state-of-the-art decomposition algorithms by implementing them in the Ket quantum programming platform and collecting numerical performance data. This is the first study to both implement and analyze the current state-of-the-art decomposition methods within a single platform. Based on our findings, we propose two compilation profiles: one optimized for minimizing compilation time and another for minimizing quantum execution time. Our results provide valuable insights for both quantum compiler developers and quantum programmers, helping them make informed decisions about gate decomposition strategies and their impact on overall performance.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20291v1
Pydrofoil: accelerating Sail-based instruction set simulators,"We present Pydrofoil, a multi-stage compiler that generates instruction set simulators (ISSs) from processor instruction set architectures (ISAs) expressed in the high-level, verification-oriented ISA specification language Sail. Pydrofoil shows a > 230x speedup over the C-based ISS generated by Sail on our benchmarks, and is based on the following insights. (i) An ISS is effectively an interpreter loop, and tracing just-in-time (JIT) compilers have proven effective at accelerating those, albeit mostly for dynamically typed languages. (ii) ISS workloads are highly atypical, dominated by intensive bit manipulation operations. Conventional compiler optimisations for general-purpose programming languages have limited impact for speeding up such workloads. We develop suitable domain-specific optimisations. (iii) Neither tracing JIT compilers, nor ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation alone, even with domain-specific optimisations, suffice for the generation of performant ISSs. Pydrofoil therefore implements a hybrid approach, pairing an AOT compiler with a tracing JIT built on the meta-tracing PyPy framework. AOT and JIT use domain-specific optimisations. Our benchmarks demonstrate that combining AOT and JIT compilers provides significantly greater performance gains than using either compiler alone.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04389v1
Coverage Semantics for Dependent Pattern Matching,"Dependent pattern matching is a key feature in dependently typed programming. However, there is a theory-practice disconnect: while many proof assistants implement pattern matching as primitive, theoretical presentations give semantics to pattern matching by elaborating to eliminators. Though theoretically convenient, eliminators can be awkward and verbose, particularly for complex combinations of patterns.   This work aims to bridge the theory-practice gap by presenting a direct categorical semantics for pattern matching, which does not elaborate to eliminators. This is achieved using sheaf theory to describe when sets of arrows (terms) can be amalgamated into a single arrow. We present a language with top-level dependent pattern matching, without specifying which sets of patterns are considered covering for a match. Then, we give a sufficient criterion for which pattern-sets admit a sound model: patterns should be in the canonical coverage for the category of contexts. Finally, we use sheaf-theoretic saturation conditions to devise some allowable sets of patterns. We are able to express and exceed the status quo, giving semantics for datatype constructors, nested patterns, absurd patterns, propositional equality, and dot patterns.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18087v1
Constructive characterisations of the must-preorder for asynchrony,"De Nicola and Hennessy's must-preorder is a contextual refinement which states that a server q refines a server p if all clients satisfied by p are also satisfied by q. Owing to the universal quantification over clients, this definition does not yield a practical proof method for the must-preorder, and alternative characterisations are necessary to reason over it. Finding these characterisations for asynchronous semantics, i.e. where outputs are non-blocking, has thus far proven to be a challenge, usually tackled via ad-hoc definitions. We show that the standard characterisations of the must-preorder carry over as they stand to asynchronous communication, if servers are enhanced to act as forwarders, i.e. they can input any message as long as they store it back into the shared buffer. Our development is constructive, is completely mechanised in Coq, and is independent of any calculus: our results pertain to Selinger output-buffered agents with feedback. This is a class of Labelled Transition Systems that captures programs that communicate via a shared unordered buffer, as in asynchronous CCS or the asynchronous pi-calculus. We show that the standard coinductive characterisation lets us prove in Coq that concrete programs are related by the must-preorder. Finally, our proofs show that Brouwer's bar induction principle is a useful technique to reason on liveness preserving program transformations.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13002v1
Härpfer's Extended Indispensability Algorithm in Z,"Since 1978, Clarence Barlow developed the ``Indispensability Function''. It operates on a metric tree that is bound to the same prime number of branches for all subtrees of each particular level. It assigns to all leaf postions of this tree a numeric value which indicates how important the acoustic presence of an event at this position is for the meter to be recognized as such.   Bernd H\""arpfer extended this concept in 2015 to deal with meters which have arbitrary groupings into two or three at any position of the tree hierarchy. This is called ``Extended Indispensability Algorithm''.   This article gives a specification of the Extended Algorithm in a slightly extended version of the Z specification language, and a possible generalization to arbitrary metric trees.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07966v2
Meta-compilation of Baseline JIT Compilers with Druid,"Virtual Machines (VMs) combine interpreters and just-in-time (JIT) compiled code to achieve good performance. However, implementing different execution engines increases the cost of developing and maintaining such solutions. JIT compilers based on meta-compilation cope with these issues by automatically generating optimizing JIT compilers. This leaves open the question of how meta-compilation applies to baseline JIT compilers, which improve warmup times by trading off optimizations.   In this paper, we present Druid, an ahead-of-time automatic approach to generate baseline JIT compiler frontends from interpreters. Language developers guide meta-compilation by annotating interpreter code and using Druid's intrinsics. Druid targets the meta-compilation to an existing JIT compiler infrastructure to achieve good warm-up performance.   We applied Druid in the context of the Pharo programming language and evaluated it by comparing an autogenerated JIT compiler frontend against the one in production for more than 10 years. Our generated JIT compiler frontend is 2x faster on average than the interpreter and achieves on average 0.7x the performance of the handwritten JIT compiler. Our experiment only required changes in 60 call sites in the interpreter, showing that our solution makes language VMs **easier to maintain and evolve in the long run**.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20543v1

Multiparty Session Types with a Bang!,"Replication is an alternative construct to recursion for describing infinite behaviours in the pi-calculus. In this paper we explore the implications of including type-level replication in Multiparty Session Types (MPST), a behavioural type theory for message-passing programs. We introduce MPST!, a session-typed multiparty process calculus with replication and first-class roles. We show that replication is not an equivalent alternative to recursion in MPST, and that using both replication and recursion in one type system in fact allows us to express both context-free protocols and protocols that support mutual exclusion and races. We demonstrate the expressiveness of MPST! on examples including binary tree serialisation, dining philosophers, and a model of an auction, and explore the implications of replication on the decidability of typechecking.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14702v1
LLMSA: A Compositional Neuro-Symbolic Approach to Compilation-free and   Customizable Static Analysis,"Static analysis is essential for program optimization, bug detection, and debugging, but its reliance on compilation and limited customization hampers practical use. Advances in LLMs enable a new paradigm of compilation-free, customizable analysis via prompting. LLMs excel in interpreting program semantics on small code snippets and allow users to define analysis tasks in natural language with few-shot examples. However, misalignment with program semantics can cause hallucinations, especially in sophisticated semantic analysis upon lengthy code snippets.   We propose LLMSA, a compositional neuro-symbolic approach for compilation-free, customizable static analysis with reduced hallucinations. Specifically, we propose an analysis policy language to support users decomposing an analysis problem into several sub-problems that target simple syntactic or semantic properties upon smaller code snippets. The problem decomposition enables the LLMs to target more manageable semantic-related sub-problems, while the syntactic ones are resolved by parsing-based analysis without hallucinations. An analysis policy is evaluated with lazy, incremental, and parallel prompting, which mitigates the hallucinations and improves the performance. It is shown that LLMSA achieves comparable and even superior performance to existing techniques in various clients. For instance, it attains 66.27% precision and 78.57% recall in taint vulnerability detection, surpassing an industrial approach in F1 score by 0.20.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14399v1

It is designed to create analysable and navigable proof searches that are open to customisation and extensions by users. Zippy is founded on concepts from functional programming theory, particularly zippers, arrows, monads, and lenses. We implemented the framework in Isabelle's metaprogramming language Isabelle/ML.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20413v1
Representation of Molecules via Algebraic Data Types : Advancing Beyond   SMILES & SELFIES,"We introduce a novel molecular representation through Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) - composite data structures formed through the combination of simpler types that obey algebraic laws. By explicitly considering how the datatype of a representation constrains the operations which may be performed, we ensure meaningful inference can be performed over generative models (programs with sample} and score operations). This stands in contrast to string-based representations where string-type operations may only indirectly correspond to chemical and physical molecular properties, and at worst produce nonsensical output. The ADT presented implements the Dietz representation for molecular constitution via multigraphs and bonding systems, and uses atomic coordinate data to represent 3D information and stereochemical features. This creates a general digital molecular representation which surpasses the limitations of the string-based representations and the 2D-graph based models on which they are based. In addition, we present novel support for quantum information through representation of shells, subshells, and orbitals, greatly expanding the representational scope beyond current approaches, for instance in Molecular Orbital theory. The framework's capabilities are demonstrated through key applications: Bayesian probabilistic programming is demonstrated through integration with LazyPPL, a lazy probabilistic programming library; molecules are made instances of a group under rotation, necessary for geometric learning techniques which exploit the invariance of molecular properties under different representations; and the framework's flexibility is demonstrated through an extension to model chemical reactions. After critiquing previous representations, we provide an open-source solution in Haskell - a type-safe, purely functional programming language.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13633v3
Actor Capabilities for Message Ordering (Extended Version),"Actor systems are a flexible model of concurrent and distributed programming, which are efficiently implementable, and avoid many classic concurrency bugs by construction. However actor systems must still deal with the challenge of messages arriving in unexpected orderings.   We describe an approach to restricting the orders in which actors send messages to each other, by equipping actor references -- the handle used to address another actor -- with a protocol restricting which message types can be sent to another actor and in which order using that particular actor reference. This endows the actor references with the properties of static (flow-sensitive) capabilities, which we call actor capabilities.   By sending other actors only restricted actor references, they may control which messages are sent in which orders by other actors. Rules for duplicating (splitting) actor references ensure that these restrictions apply even in the presence of delegation. The capabilities themselves restrict message ordering, which may form the foundation for stronger forms of reasoning. We demonstrate this by layering an effect system over the base type system, where the relationships enforced between the actor capabilities and the effects of an actor's behaviour ensure that an actor's behaviour is always prepared to handle any message that may arrive.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07958v1
LitmusKt: Concurrency Stress Testing for Kotlin,"We present LitmusKt - the first tool for litmus testing concurrent programs in Kotlin. The tool's novelty also lies in the fact that Kotlin is a multiplatform language, i.e., it compiles into multiple platforms, which means that the concurrency has to be tested on several of them. Our tool allows writing litmus tests in a single custom DSL, and these tests are then run in Kotlin/Native and Kotlin/JVM, two main platforms for concurrent programming in Kotlin. Using LitmusKt, we discovered novel bugs in the Kotlin compiler, which we then fixed and they are no longer present. Moreover, LitmusKt was integrated into the CI pipeline for Kotlin. LitmusKt is available on GitHub: https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/litmuskt. The demo is available on YouTube: https://youtu.be/oWCZp_Huwss.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07472v2
Control Flow-Augmented Decompiler based on Large Language Model,"Binary decompilation plays a crucial role in various tasks related to security threat analysis and software engineering, such as binary vulnerability detection and software supply chain analysis. Current prevalent binary decompilation methods primarily rely on large language models (LLMs) and can be broadly classified into two main approaches: prompt-based decompilation and end-toend decompilation. Prompt-based methods typically require significant effort to analyze and summarize the predicted data to extract aspect-specific expert knowledge, which is then fed into a general purpose large language model to address specific decompilation tasks. End-to-end methods, on the other hand, carefully construct training datasets or neural networks to perform post-training on general-purpose large language models, thereby obtaining domain-specific large language models for decompiling the predicted data. However, both existing approaches still face significant challenges, including the absence of rich semantic representations of the input code and the neglect of control flow information, which is crucial for accurate decompilation. Furthermore, most current decompilation techniques are specifically tailored for the x86 architecture, making it difficult to efficiently adapt and generalize them to other bit width or instruction architectures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end decompilation LLM, CFADecLLM, which aims to enhance existing end-to-end decompilation methods. We conduct extensive experiments on the public dataset Humaneval and Exebench across four optimization levels, and results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness and superiority.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07215v1
CRANE: Reasoning with constrained LLM generation,"Code generation, symbolic math reasoning, and other tasks require LLMs to produce outputs that are both syntactically and semantically correct. Constrained LLM generation is a promising direction to enforce adherence to formal grammar, but prior works have empirically observed that strict enforcement of formal constraints often diminishes the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In this work, we first provide a theoretical explanation for why constraining LLM outputs to very restrictive grammars that only allow syntactically valid final answers reduces the reasoning capabilities of the model. Second, we demonstrate that by augmenting the output grammar with carefully designed additional rules, it is always possible to preserve the reasoning capabilities of the LLM while ensuring syntactic and semantic correctness in its outputs. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose a reasoning-augmented constrained decoding algorithm, CRANE, which effectively balances the correctness of constrained generation with the flexibility of unconstrained generation. Experiments on multiple open-source LLMs and benchmarks show that CRANE significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art constrained decoding strategies and standard unconstrained decoding, showing up to 10% points accuracy improvement over baselines on challenging symbolic reasoning benchmarks GSM-symbolic and FOLIO.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09061v3
A Primal-Dual Perspective on Program Verification Algorithms (Extended   Version),"Many algorithms in verification and automated reasoning leverage some form of duality between proofs and refutations or counterexamples. In most cases, duality is only used as an intuition that helps in understanding the algorithms and is not formalized. In other cases, duality is used explicitly, but in a specially tailored way that does not generalize to other problems.   In this paper we propose a unified primal-dual framework for designing verification algorithms that leverage duality. To that end, we generalize the concept of a Lagrangian that is commonly used in linear programming and optimization to capture the domains considered in verification problems, which are usually discrete, e.g., powersets of states, predicates, ranking functions, etc. A Lagrangian then induces a primal problem and a dual problem. We devise an abstract primal-dual procedure that simultaneously searches for a primal solution and a dual solution, where the two searches guide each other. We provide sufficient conditions that ensure that the procedure makes progress under certain monotonicity assumptions on the Lagrangian.   We show that many existing algorithms in program analysis, verification, and automated reasoning can be derived from our algorithmic framework with a suitable choice of Lagrangian. The Lagrangian-based formulation sheds new light on various characteristics of these algorithms, such as the ingredients they use to ensure monotonicity and guarantee progress. We further use our framework to develop a new validity checking algorithm for fixpoint logic over quantified linear arithmetic. Our prototype achieves promising results and in some cases solves instances that are not solved by state-of-the-art techniques.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01512v1
An Incremental Algorithm for Algebraic Program Analysis,"We propose a method for conducting algebraic program analysis (APA) incrementally in response to changes of the program under analysis. APA is a program analysis paradigm that consists of two distinct steps: computing a path expression that succinctly summarizes the set of program paths of interest, and interpreting the path expression using a properly-defined semantic algebra to obtain program properties of interest. In this context, the goal of an incremental algorithm is to reduce the analysis time by leveraging the intermediate results computed before the program changes. We have made two main contributions. First, we propose a data structure for efficiently representing path expression as a tree together with a tree-based interpreting method. Second, we propose techniques for efficiently updating the program properties in response to changes of the path expression. We have implemented our method and evaluated it on thirteen Java applications from the DaCapo benchmark suite. The experimental results show that both our method for incrementally computing path expression and our method for incrementally interpreting path expression are effective in speeding up the analysis. Compared to the baseline APA and two state-of-the-art APA methods, the speedup of our method ranges from 160X to 4761X depending on the types of program analyses performed.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10632v1
Omelets Need Onions: E-graphs Modulo Theories via Bottom-up E-matching,"E-graphs are a data structure for equational reasoning and optimization over ground terms. One of the benefits of e-graph rewriting is that it can declaratively handle useful but difficult to orient identities like associativity and commutativity (AC) in a generic way. However, using these generic mechanisms is more computationally expensive than using bespoke routines on terms containing sets, multi-sets, linear expressions, polynomials, and binders. A natural question arises: How can one combine the generic capabilities of e-graph rewriting with these specialized theories. This paper discusses a pragmatic approach to this e-graphs modulo theories (EMT) question using two key ideas: bottom-up e-matching and semantic e-ids.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14340v1
Skitter: A Distributed Stream Processing Framework with Pluggable   Distribution Strategies,"Context: Distributed Stream Processing Frameworks (DSPFs) are popular tools for expressing real-time Big Data applications that have to handle enormous volumes of data in real time. These frameworks distribute their applications over a cluster in order to scale horizontally along with the amount of incoming data.   Inquiry: Crucial for the performance of such applications is the **distribution strategy** that is used to partition data and computations over the cluster nodes. In some DSPFs, like Apache Spark or Flink, the distribution strategy is hardwired into the framework which can lead to inefficient applications. The other end of the spectrum is offered by Apache Storm, which offers a low-level model wherein programmers can implement their own distribution strategies on a per-application basis to improve efficiency. However, this model conflates distribution and data processing logic, making it difficult to modify either. As a consequence, today's cluster application developers either have to accept the built-in distribution strategies of a high-level framework or accept the complexity of expressing a distribution strategy in Storm's low-level model.   Approach: We propose a novel programming model wherein data processing operations and their distribution strategies are decoupled from one another and where new strategies can be created in a modular fashion.   Knowledge: The introduced language abstractions cleanly separate the data processing and distribution logic of a stream processing application. This enables the expression of stream processing applications in a high-level framework while still retaining the flexibility offered by Storm's low-level model.   Grounding: We implement our programming model as a domain-specific language, called Skitter, and use it to evaluate our approach. Our evaluation shows that Skitter enables the implementation of existing distribution strategies from the state of the art in a modular fashion. Our performance evaluation shows that the strategies implemented in Skitter exhibit the expected performance characteristics and that applications written in Skitter obtain throughput rates in the same order of magnitude as Storm.   Importance: Our work enables developers to select the most performant distribution strategy for each operation in their application, while still retaining the programming model offered by high-level frameworks.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20538v1
Correctness Witnesses with Function Contracts,"Software verification witnesses are a common exchange format for software verification tools. They were developed to provide arguments supporting the verification result, allowing other tools to reproduce the verification results. Correctness witnesses in the current format (version 2.0) allow only for the encoding of loop and location invariants using C expressions. This limits the correctness arguments that verifiers can express in the witness format. One particular limitation is the inability to express function contracts, which consist of a pre-condition and a post-condition for a function. We propose an extension to the existing witness format 2.0 to allow for the specification of function contracts. Our extension includes support for several features inspired by ACSL (\result, \old, \at). This allows for the export of more information from tools and for the exchange of information with tools that require function contracts.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12313v1
Guarding the Privacy of Label-Only Access to Neural Network Classifiers   via iDP Verification,"Neural networks are susceptible to privacy attacks that can extract private information of the training set. To cope, several training algorithms guarantee differential privacy (DP) by adding noise to their computation. However, DP requires to add noise considering every possible training set. This leads to a significant decrease in the network's accuracy. Individual DP (iDP) restricts DP to a given training set. We observe that some inputs deterministically satisfy iDP without any noise. By identifying them, we can provide iDP label-only access to the network with a minor decrease to its accuracy. However, identifying the inputs that satisfy iDP without any noise is highly challenging. Our key idea is to compute the iDP deterministic bound (iDP-DB), which overapproximates the set of inputs that do not satisfy iDP, and add noise only to their predicted labels. To compute the tightest iDP-DB, which enables to guard the label-only access with minimal accuracy decrease, we propose LUCID, which leverages several formal verification techniques. First, it encodes the problem as a mixed-integer linear program, defined over a network and over every network trained identically but without a unique data point. Second, it abstracts a set of networks using a hyper-network. Third, it eliminates the overapproximation error via a novel branch-and-bound technique. Fourth, it bounds the differences of matching neurons in the network and the hyper-network and employs linear relaxation if they are small. We show that LUCID can provide classifiers with a perfect individuals' privacy guarantee (0-iDP) -- which is infeasible for DP training algorithms -- with an accuracy decrease of 1.4%. For more relaxed $\varepsilon$-iDP guarantees, LUCID has an accuracy decrease of 1.2%. In contrast, existing DP training algorithms reduce the accuracy by 12.7%.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16519v2
Data-efficient Performance Modeling via Pre-training,"Performance models are essential for automatic code optimization, enabling compilers to predict the effects of code transformations on performance and guide search for optimal transformations. Building state-of-the-art performance models with deep learning, however, requires vast labeled datasets of random programs -- an expensive and time-consuming process, stretching over months. This paper introduces a self-supervised pre-training scheme with autoencoders to reduce the need for labeled data. By pre-training on a large dataset of random programs, the autoencoder learns representations of code and transformations, which are then used to embed programs for the performance model. Implemented in the Tiramisu autoscheduler, our approach improves model accuracy with less data. For example, to achieve a MAPE of 20.72%, the original model requires 18 million data points, whereas our method achieves a similar MAPE of 22.44% with only 3.6 million data points, reducing data requirements by 5x.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14438v1
Automatic Goal Clone Detection in Rocq,"Proof engineering in Rocq is a labor-intensive process, and as proof developments grow in size, redundancy and maintainability become challenges. One such redundancy is goal cloning, i.e., proving {\alpha}-equivalent goals multiple times, leading to wasted effort and bloated proof scripts. In this paper, we introduce clone-finder, a novel technique for detecting goal clones in Rocq proofs. By leveraging the formal notion of {\alpha}-equivalence for Gallina terms, clone-finder systematically identifies duplicated proof goals across large Rocq codebases. We evaluate clone-finder on 40 real-world Rocq projects from the CoqGym dataset. Our results reveal that each project contains an average of 27.73 instances of goal clone. We observed that the clones can be categorized as either exact goal duplication, generalization, or {\alpha}-equivalent goals with different proofs, each signifying varying levels duplicate effort. Our findings highlight significant untapped potential for proof reuse in Rocq-based formal verification projects, paving the way for future improvements in automated proof engineering.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19129v1
Relaxed exception semantics for Arm-A (extended version),"To manage exceptions, software relies on a key architectural guarantee, precision: that exceptions appear to execute between instructions. However, this definition, dating back over 60 years, fundamentally assumes a sequential programmers model. Modern architectures such as Arm-A with programmer-observable relaxed behaviour make such a naive definition inadequate, and it is unclear exactly what guarantees programmers have on exception entry and exit.   In this paper, we clarify the concepts needed to discuss exceptions in the relaxed-memory setting -- a key aspect of precisely specifying the architectural interface between hardware and software. We explore the basic relaxed behaviour across exception boundaries, and the semantics of external aborts, using Arm-A as a representative modern architecture. We identify an important problem, present yet unexplored for decades: pinning down what it means for exceptions to be precise in a relaxed setting. We describe key phenomena that any definition should account for. We develop an axiomatic model for Arm-A precise exceptions, tooling for axiomatic model execution, and a library of tests. Finally we explore the relaxed semantics of software-generated interrupts, as used in sophisticated programming patterns, and sketch how they too could be modelled.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15140v1

We implement a typed QASM 3.0 parser in TypeScript to enable implementations of verification and validation software, compilers and more.

We highlight advancements in hybrid quantum-classical computing since the Quantum Hoare Logic to this end.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12578v1
An Intermediate Program Representation for Optimizing Stream-Based   Languages,"Stream-based runtime monitors are safety assurance tools that check at runtime whether the system's behavior satisfies a formal specification. Specifications consist of stream equations, which relate input streams, containing sensor readings and other incoming information, to output streams, representing filtered and aggregated data. This paper presents a framework for the stream-based specification language RTLola. We introduce a new intermediate representation for stream-based languages, the StreamIR, which, like the specification language, operates on streams of unbounded length; while the stream equations are replaced by imperative programs. We developed a set of optimizations based on static analysis of the specification and have implemented an interpreter and a compiler for several target languages. In our evaluation, we measure the performance of several real-world case studies. The results show that using the StreamIR framework reduces the runtime significantly compared to the existing StreamIR interpreter. We evaluate the effect of the optimizations and show that significant performance gains are possible beyond the optimizations of the target language's compiler. While our current implementation is limited to RTLola, the StreamIR is designed to accommodate other stream-based languages, enabling their interpretation and compilation into all available target languages.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21458v1
Automated Profile-Guided Replacement of Data Structures to Reduce Memory   Allocation,"Data structures are a cornerstone of most modern programming languages. Whether they are provided via separate libraries, built into the language specification, or as part of the language's standard library -- data structures such as lists, maps, sets, or arrays provide programmers with a large repertoire of tools to deal with data. Moreover, each kind of data structure typically comes with a variety of implementations that focus on scalability, memory efficiency, performance, thread-safety, or similar aspects. Choosing the *right* data structure for a particular use case can be difficult or even impossible if the data structure is part of a framework over which the user has no control. It typically requires in-depth knowledge about the program and, in particular, about the usage of the data structure in question. However, it is usually not feasible for developers to obtain such information about programs in advance. Hence, it makes sense to look for a more automated way for optimizing data structures. We present an approach to automatically replace data structures in Java applications. We use profiling to determine allocation-site-specific metrics about data structures and their usages, and then automatically replace their allocations with customized versions, focusing on memory efficiency. Our approach is integrated into GraalVM Native Image, an Ahead-of-Time compiler for Java applications. By analyzing the generated data structure profiles, we show how standard benchmarks and microservice-based applications use data structures and demonstrate the impact of customized data structures on the memory usage of applications. We conducted an evaluation on standard and microservice-based benchmarks, in which the memory usage was reduced by up to 13.85 % in benchmarks that make heavy use of data structures. While others are only slightly affected, we could still reduce the average memory usage by 1.63 % in standard benchmarks and by 2.94 % in microservice-based benchmarks. We argue that our work demonstrates that choosing appropriate data structures can reduce the memory usage of applications. While acknowledge that our approach does not provide benefits for all kinds of workloads, our work nevertheless shows how automated profiling and replacement can be used to optimize data structures in general. Hence, we argue that our work could pave the way for future optimizations of data structures.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20536v1
Pedagogy of Teaching Pointers in the C Programming Language using Graph   Transformations,"Visual learners think in pictures rather than words and learn best when they utilize representations based on graphs, tables, charts, maps, colors and diagrams. We propose a new pedagogy for teaching pointers in the C programming language using graph transformation systems to visually simulate pointer manipulation. In an Introduction to C course, the topic of pointers is often the most difficult one for students to understand; therefore, we experiment with graph-based representations of dynamic pointer structures to reinforce the learning. Groove, a graph transformation tool, is used to illustrate the behaviour of pointers through modelling and simulation. A study is presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. This paper will also provide a comparison to other teaching methods in this area.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20469v1
Bounded Exhaustive Random Program Generation for Testing Solidity   Compilers and Analyzers,"Random program generators often exhibit opportunism: they generate programs without a specific focus within the vast search space defined by the programming language. This opportunistic behavior hinders the effective generation of programs that trigger bugs in compilers and analyzers, even when such programs closely resemble those generated. To address this limitation, we propose bounded exhaustive random program generation, a novel method that focuses the search space of program generation with the aim of more quickly identifying bug-triggering programs. Our approach comprises two stages: 1) generating random program templates, which are incomplete test programs containing bug-related placeholders, and 2) conducting a bounded exhaustive enumeration of valid values for each placeholder within these templates. To ensure efficiency, we maintain a solvable constraint set during the template generation phase and then methodically explore all possible values of placeholders within these constraints during the exhaustive enumeration phase. We have implemented this approach for Solidity, a popular smart contract language for the Ethereum blockchain, in a tool named Erwin. Based on a recent study of Solidity compiler bugs, the placeholders used by Erwin relate to language features commonly associated with compiler bugs. Erwin has successfully identified 23 previously unknown bugs across two Solidity compilers, solc and solang, and one Solidity static analyzer, slither. Evaluation results demonstrate that Erwin outperforms state-of-the-art Solidity fuzzers in bug detection and complements developer-written test suites by covering 4,582 edges and 14,737 lines of the solc compiler that were missed by solc unit tests.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20332v5
Provenance Guided Rollback Suggestions,"Advances in incremental Datalog evaluation strategies have made Datalog popular among use cases with constantly evolving inputs such as static analysis in continuous integration and deployment pipelines. As a result, new logic programming debugging techniques are needed to support these emerging use cases.   This paper introduces an incremental debugging technique for Datalog, which determines the failing changes for a \emph{rollback} in an incremental setup. Our debugging technique leverages a novel incremental provenance method. We have implemented our technique using an incremental version of the Souffl\'{e} Datalog engine and evaluated its effectiveness on the DaCapo Java program benchmarks analyzed by the Doop static analysis library. Compared to state-of-the-art techniques, we can localize faults and suggest rollbacks with an overall speedup of over 26.9$\times$ while providing higher quality results.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09225v1
Morello: Compiling Fast Neural Networks with Dynamic Programming and   Spatial Compression,"High-throughput neural network inference requires coordinating many optimization decisions, including parallel tiling, microkernel selection, and data layout. The product of these decisions forms a search space of programs which is typically intractably large. Existing approaches (e.g., auto-schedulers) often address this problem by sampling this space heuristically. In contrast, we introduce a dynamic-programming-based approach to explore more of the search space by iteratively decomposing large program specifications into smaller specifications reachable from a set of rewrites, then composing a final program from each rewrite that minimizes an affine cost model. To reduce memory requirements, we employ a novel memoization table representation, which indexes specifications by coordinates in $Z_{\geq 0}$ and compresses identical, adjacent solutions. This approach can visit a much larger set of programs than prior work. To evaluate the approach, we developed Morello, a compiler which lowers specifications roughly equivalent to a few-node XLA computation graph to x86. Notably, we found that an affine cost model is sufficient to surface high-throughput programs. For example, Morello synthesized a collection of matrix multiplication benchmarks targeting a Zen 1 CPU, including a 1x2048x16384, bfloat16-to-float32 vector-matrix multiply, which was integrated into Google's gemma.cpp.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01637v1
Coinductive Proofs for Temporal Hyperliveness,"Temporal logics for hyperproperties have recently emerged as an expressive specification technique for relational properties of reactive systems. While the model checking problem for such logics has been widely studied, there is a scarcity of deductive proof systems for temporal hyperproperties. In particular, hyperproperties with an alternation of universal and existential quantification over system executions are rarely supported. In this paper, we focus on the difficult class of hyperproperties of the form $\forall^*\exists^*\psi$, where $\psi$ is a safety relation. We show that hyperproperties of this class -- which includes many hyperliveness properties of interest -- can always be approximated by coinductive relations. This enables intuitive proofs by coinduction. Based on this observation, we define HyCo (HYperproperties, COinductively), a mechanized framework to reason about temporal hyperproperties within the Coq proof assistant. We detail the construction of HyCo, provide a proof of its soundness, and exemplify its use by applying it to the verification of reactive systems modeled as imperative programs with nondeterminism and I/O.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07920v1
Intrinsic Verification of Parsers and Formal Grammar Theory in Dependent   Lambek Calculus (Extended Version),"We present Dependent Lambek Calculus, a domain-specific dependent type theory for verified parsing and formal grammar theory. In $\textrm{Lambek}^D$, linear types are used as a syntax for formal grammars,and parsers can be written as linear terms. The linear typing restriction provides a form of intrinsic verification that a parser yields only valid parse trees for the input string. We demonstrate the expressivity of this system by showing that the combination of inductive linear types and dependency on non-linear data can be used to encode commonly used grammar formalisms such as regular and context-free grammars as well as traces of various types of automata. Using these encodings, we define parsers for regular expressions using deterministic automata, as well as examples of verified parsers of context-free grammars.   We present a denotational semantics of our type theory that interprets the linear types as functions from strings to sets of abstract parse trees and terms as parse transformers. Based on this denotational semantics, we have made a prototype implementation of $\textrm{Lambek}^D$ using a shallow embedding in the Agda proof assistant. All of our examples parsers have been implemented in this prototype implementation.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03995v3
Dynamic Program Slices Change How Developers Diagnose Gradual Run-Time   Type Errors,"A gradual type system allows developers to declare certain types to be enforced by the compiler (i.e., statically typed), while leaving other types to be enforced via runtime checks (i.e., dynamically typed). When runtime checks fail, debugging gradually typed programs becomes cumbersome, because these failures may arise far from the original point where an inconsistent type assumption is made. To ease this burden on developers, some gradually typed languages produce a blame report for a given type inconsistency. However, these reports are sometimes misleading, because they might point to program points that do not need to be changed to stop the error.   To overcome the limitations of blame reports, we propose using dynamic program slicing as an alternative approach to help programmers debug run-time type errors. We describe a proof-of-concept for TypeSlicer, a tool that would present dynamic program slices to developers when a runtime check fails. We performed a Wizard-of-Oz user study to investigate how developers respond to dynamic program slices through a set of simulated interactions with TypeScript programs. This formative study shows that developers can understand and apply dynamic slice information to provide change recommendations when debugging runtime type errors.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20533v1

Scalable Equivalence Checking and Verification of Shallow Quantum   Circuits,"This paper concerns the problem of checking if two shallow (i.e., constant-depth) quantum circuits perform equivalent computations. Equivalence checking is a fundamental correctness question -- needed, e.g., for ensuring that transformations applied to a quantum circuit do not alter its behavior. For quantum circuits, the problem is challenging because a straightforward representation on a classical computer of each circuit's quantum state can require time and space that are exponential in the number of qubits $n$.   The paper presents decision procedures for two variants of the equivalence-checking problem. Both can be carried out on a classical computer in time and space that, for any fixed depth, is linear in $n$. Our critical insight is that local projections are precise enough to completely characterize the output state of a shallow quantum circuit. Instead of explicitly computing the output state of a circuit, we generate a set of local projections that serve as constraints on the output state. Moreover, the circuit's output state is the unique quantum state that satisfies all the constraints.   Beyond equivalence checking, we show how to use the constraint representation to check a class of assertions, both statically and at run time. Our assertion-checking methods are sound and complete for assertions expressed as conjunctions of local projections.   Our experiments show that on a server equipped with 2 x Intel\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Xeon\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Gold 6338 CPUs (128 threads total) and 1.0~TiB of RAM, running Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS, the constraint representation of a random 100-qubit circuit of depth 6 can be computed in 19.8 seconds. For fixed inputs $\ket{0}^{\otimes 100}$, equivalence checking of {random} 100-qubit circuits of depth 3 takes 4.46 seconds; for arbitrary inputs, it takes no more than 31.96 seconds.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01558v1
"LLMigrate: Transforming ""Lazy"" Large Language Models into Efficient   Source Code Migrators","Rewriting C code in Rust provides stronger memory safety, yet migrating large codebases such as the 32-million-line Linux kernel remains challenging. While rule-based translators (e.g., C2Rust) provide accurate yet largely unsafe Rust programs, recent Large Language Model (LLM) approaches produce more idiomatic, safe Rust programs but frequently exhibit ""laziness"", omitting significant portions of the target code. To address the issue, in this paper, we present LLMigrate, an LLM-based C-to-Rust translation tool that splits modules into discrete functions, translating them individually, and then reintegrating them. LLMigrate uses static analysis to retain necessary context, pairs GPT-4o (a state-of-the-art LLM) with compiler-driven translation and program-repair techniques for complex core functions, and leverages call-graph-guided translation to ensure consistent interfaces.

Assuming power is constant, the general trend is that faster programs consume less energy, thus optimizing a program for speed would also improve its energy efficiency.   We investigate this tendency in a set of C++ and Java solutions mined from Code Submission Evaluation System (CSES), a popular programming competition site, where each solution must give the correct answer under a given time limit. In such context, we can consider that all correct solutions for a problem were written with a speed concern, but not with energy efficiency in mind.   We selected 15 problems from CSES and for each of them we mined at least 30 C++ and Java solutions, evaluating time and energy efficiency of each solution in at least two different machines. In our scenario, where there is a great diversity of programming styles, execution speed, and memory usage, we could confirm the general trend: faster programs consume less energy. Moreover, we were able to use ordinary least squares to fit a linear function, with good precision, that relates energy consumption of a program based on its execution time, as well as to automatically identify programs with abnormal energy consumption. A manual analysis of these programs revealed that often they perform a different amount of allocation and deallocation operations when compared to programs with similar execution times.   We also calculated the energy consumption profile of sets of random C++ solutions for these 15 CSES problems, and we tried to associate each set with its corresponding CSES problem by using the energy consumption profiles previously computed for each one of them. With this approach, we restricted, for each set of random C++ solutions, the classification task to a subset of 7 CSES problems, a reduction of more than 50% in the search space.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14877v1
FLAT: Formal Languages as Types,"Programmers regularly use strings to encode many types of data, such as Unix file paths, URLs, and email addresses, that are conceptually different. However, existing mainstream programming languages use a unified string type to represent them all. As a result, their type systems will keep quiet when a function requiring an email address is instead fed an HTML text, which may cause unexceptional failures or vulnerabilities.   To let the type system distinguish such conceptually different string types, in this paper, we propose to regard \emph{formal languages as types} (FLAT), thereby restricting the set of valid strings by context-free grammars and semantic constraints if needed. To this end, email addresses and HTML text are treated as different types. We realize this idea in Python as a testing framework FLAT-PY. It contains user annotations, all directly attached to the user's code, to (1) define such \emph{language types}, (2) specify pre-/post-conditions serving as \emph{semantic oracles} or contracts for functions, and (3) fuzz functions via random string inputs generated from a \emph{language-based fuzzer}. From these annotations, FLAY-PY \emph{automatically} checks type correctness at runtime via \emph{code instrumentation}, and reports any detected type error as soon as possible, preventing bugs from flowing deeply into other parts of the code. Case studies on real Python code fragments show that FLAT-PY is enable to catch logical bugs from random inputs, requiring a reasonable amount of user annotations.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11501v1
vNV-Heap: An Ownership-Based Virtually Non-Volatile Heap for Embedded   Systems,"The Internet of Batteryless Things might revolutionize our understanding of connected devices by harvesting required operational energy from the environment. These systems come with the system-software challenge that the intermittently powered IoT devices have to checkpoint their state in non-volatile memory to later resume with this state when sufficient energy is available. The scarce energy resources demand that only modified data is persisted before a power failure, which requires precise modification tracking.   We present vNV-Heap, the first ownership-based virtually Non-Volatile Heap for intermittently powered systems with guaranteed power-failure resilience. The heap exploits ownership systems, a zero-cost (i.e., compile-time) abstraction for example implemented by Rust, to track modifications and virtualize object persistence. To achieve power-failure resilience, our heap is designed and implemented to guarantee bounded operations by static program code analysis: For example, the heap allows for determining a worst-case energy consumption for the operation of persisting modified and currently volatile objects. The evaluation of our open-source implementation on an embedded hardware platform (i.e., ESP32-C3) shows that using our heap abstraction is more energy efficient than existing approaches while also providing runtime guarantees by static worst-case bounds.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17707v3
"Compiling C to Safe Rust, Formalized","The popularity of the Rust language continues to explode; yet, many critical codebases remain authored in C, and cannot be realistically rewritten by hand. Automatically translating C to Rust is thus an appealing course of action. Several works have gone down this path, handling an ever-increasing subset of C through a variety of Rust features, such as unsafe. While the prospect of automation is appealing, producing code that relies on unsafe negates the memory safety guarantees offered by Rust, and therefore the main advantages of porting existing codebases to memory-safe languages.   We instead explore a different path, and explore what it would take to translate C to safe Rust; that is, to produce code that is trivially memory safe, because it abides by Rust's type system without caveats. Our work sports several original contributions: a type-directed translation from (a subset of) C to safe Rust; a novel static analysis based on ""split trees"" that allows expressing C's pointer arithmetic using Rust's slices and splitting operations; an analysis that infers exactly which borrows need to be mutable; and a compilation strategy for C's struct types that is compatible with Rust's distinction between non-owned and owned allocations.   We apply our methodology to existing formally verified C codebases: the HACL* cryptographic library, and binary parsers and serializers from EverParse, and show that the subset of C we support is sufficient to translate both applications to safe Rust. Our evaluation shows that for the few places that do violate Rust's aliasing discipline, automated, surgical rewrites suffice; and that the few strategic copies we insert have a negligible performance impact. Of particular note, the application of our approach to HACL* results in a 80,000 line verified cryptographic library, written in pure Rust, that implements all modern algorithms - the first of its kind.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15042v1
Zoozve: A Strip-Mining-Free RISC-V Vector Extension with Arbitrary   Register Grouping Compilation Support (WIP),"Vector processing is crucial for boosting processor performance and efficiency, particularly with data-parallel tasks. The RISC-V ""V"" Vector Extension (RVV) enhances algorithm efficiency by supporting vector registers of dynamic sizes and their grouping. Nevertheless, for very long vectors, the static number of RVV vector registers and its power-of-two grouping can lead to performance restrictions. To counteract this limitation, this work introduces Zoozve, a RISC-V vector instruction extension that eliminates the need for strip-mining. Zoozve allows for flexible vector register length and count configurations to boost data computation parallelism. With a data-adaptive register allocation approach, Zoozve permits any register groupings and accurately aligns vector lengths, cutting down register overhead and alleviating performance declines from strip-mining. Additionally, the paper details Zoozve's compiler and hardware implementations using LLVM and SystemVerilog. Initial results indicate Zoozve yields a minimum 10.10$\times$ reduction in dynamic instruction count for fast Fourier transform (FFT), with a mere 5.2\% increase in overall silicon area.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15678v1
Statistical data analysis for Tourism in Poland in R Programming   Environment,"This study utilises the R programming language for statistical data analysis to understand Tourism dynamics in Poland. It focuses on methods for data visualisation, multivariate statistics, and hypothesis testing. To investigate the expenditure behavior of tourist, spending patterns, correlations, and associations among variables were analysed in the dataset. The results revealed a significant relationship between accommodation type and the purpose of trip, showing that the purpose of a trip impacts the selection of accommodation. A strong correlation was observed between organizer expenditure and private expenditure, indicating that individual spending are more when the spending on organizing the trip are higher. However, no significant difference was observed in total expenditure across different accommodation types and purpose of the trip revealing that travelers tend to spend similar amounts regardless of their reason for travel or choice of accommodation. Although significant relationships were observed among certain variables, ANOVA could not be applied because the dataset was not able to hold on the normality assumption. In future, the dataset can be explored further to find more meaningful insights.

Modular Compilation for Quantum Chiplet Architectures,"As quantum computing technology matures, industry is adopting modular quantum architectures to keep quantum scaling on the projected path and meet performance targets. However, the complexity of chiplet-based quantum devices, coupled with their growing size, presents an imminent scalability challenge for quantum compilation. Contemporary compilation methods are not well-suited to chiplet architectures - in particular, existing qubit allocation methods are often unable to contend with inter-chiplet links, which don't necessarily support a universal basis gate set. Furthermore, existing methods of logical-to-physical qubit placement, swap insertion (routing), unitary synthesis, and/or optimization, are typically not designed for qubit links of significantly varying latency or fidelity. In this work, we propose SEQC, a hierarchical parallelized compilation pipeline optimized for chiplet-based quantum systems, including several novel methods for qubit placement, qubit routing, and circuit optimization. SEQC attains a $9.3\%$ average increase in circuit fidelity (up to $49.99\%$). Additionally, owing to its ability to parallelize compilation, SEQC achieves $3.27\times$ faster compilation on average (up to $6.74\times$) over a chiplet-unaware Qiskit baseline.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08478v3
NPB-Rust: NAS Parallel Benchmarks in Rust,"Parallel programming often requires developers to handle complex computational tasks that can yield many errors in its development cycle. Rust is a performant low-level language that promises memory safety guarantees with its compiler, making it an attractive option for HPC application developers. We identified that the Rust ecosystem could benefit from more comprehensive scientific benchmark suites for standardizing comparisons and research. The NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB) is a standardized suite for evaluating various hardware aspects and is often used to compare different frameworks for parallelism. Therefore, our contributions are a Rust version of NPB, an analysis of the expressiveness and performance of the language features, and parallelization strategies. We compare our implementation with consolidated sequential and parallel versions of NPB. Experimental results show that Rust's sequential version is 1.23\% slower than Fortran and 5.59\% faster than C++, while Rust with Rayon was slower than both Fortran and C++ with OpenMP.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15536v1
Bean: A Language for Backward Error Analysis,"Backward error analysis offers a method for assessing the quality of numerical programs in the presence of floating-point rounding errors. However, techniques from the numerical analysis literature for quantifying backward error require substantial human effort, and there are currently no tools or automated methods for statically deriving sound backward error bounds. To address this gap, we propose Bean, a typed first-order programming language designed to express quantitative bounds on backward error. Bean's type system combines a graded coeffect system with strict linearity to soundly track the flow of backward error through programs. We prove the soundness of our system using a novel categorical semantics, where every Bean program denotes a triple of related transformations that together satisfy a backward error guarantee.   To illustrate Bean's potential as a practical tool for automated backward error analysis, we implement a variety of standard algorithms from numerical linear algebra in Bean, establishing fine-grained backward error bounds via typing in a compositional style. We also develop a prototype implementation of Bean that infers backward error bounds automatically. Our evaluation shows that these inferred bounds match worst-case theoretical relative backward error bounds from the literature, underscoring Bean's utility in validating a key property of numerical programs: numerical stability.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14550v1
Verified Lifting of Deep learning Operators,"Deep learning operators are fundamental components of modern deep learning frameworks. With the growing demand for customized operators, it has become increasingly common for developers to create their own. However, designing and implementing operators is complex and error-prone, due to hardware-specific optimizations and the need for numerical stability. There is a pressing need for tools that can summarize the functionality of both existing and user-defined operators. To address this gap, this work introduces a novel framework for the verified lifting of deep learning operators, which synthesizes high-level mathematical formulas from low-level implementations. Our approach combines symbolic execution, syntax-guided synthesis, and SMT-based verification to produce readable and formally verified mathematical formulas. In synthesis, we employ a combination of top-down and bottom-up strategies to explore the vast search space efficiently; In verification, we design invariant synthesis patterns and leverage SMT solvers to validate the correctness of the derived summaries; In simplification, we use egraph-based techniques with custom rules to restore complex formulas to their natural, intuitive forms. Evaluated on a dataset of deep learning operators implemented in Triton from the real world, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of synthesis and verification compared to existing techniques. This framework bridges the gap between low-level implementations and high-level abstractions, improving understanding and reliability in deep learning operator development.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20992v1
A Formally Verified Robustness Certifier for Neural Networks (Extended   Version),"Neural networks are often susceptible to minor perturbations in input that cause them to misclassify. A recent solution to this problem is the use of globally-robust neural networks, which employ a function to certify that the classification of an input cannot be altered by such a perturbation. Outputs that pass this test are called certified robust. However, to the authors' knowledge, these certification functions have not yet been verified at the implementation level. We demonstrate how previous unverified implementations are exploitably unsound in certain circumstances. Moreover, they often rely on approximation-based algorithms, such as power iteration, that (perhaps surprisingly) do not guarantee soundness. To provide assurance that a given output is robust, we implemented and formally verified a certification function for globally-robust neural networks in Dafny. We describe the program, its specifications, and the important design decisions taken for its implementation and verification, as well as our experience applying it in practice.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06958v1
AWDIT: An Optimal Weak Database Isolation Tester,"In order to achieve low latency, high throughput, and partition tolerance, modern databases forgo strong transaction isolation for weak isolation guarantees. However, several production databases have been found to suffer from isolation bugs, breaking their data-consistency contract. Black-box testing is a prominent technique for detecting isolation bugs, by checking whether histories of database transactions adhere to a prescribed isolation level.   Testing databases on realistic workloads of large size requires isolation testers to be as efficient as possible, a requirement that has initiated a study of the complexity of isolation testing. Although testing strong isolation has been known to be NP-complete, weak isolation levels were recently shown to be testable in polynomial time, which has propelled the scalability of testing tools. However, existing testers have a large polynomial complexity, restricting testing to workloads of only moderate size, which is not typical of large-scale databases.   In this work, we develop AWDIT, a highly-efficient and provably optimal tester for weak database isolation. Given a history $H$ of size $n$ and $k$ sessions, AWDIT tests whether H satisfies the most common weak isolation levels of Read Committed (RC), Read Atomic (RA), and Causal Consistency (CC) in time $O(n^{3/2})$, $O(n^{3/2})$, and $O(n \cdot k)$, respectively, improving significantly over the state of the art. Moreover, we prove that AWDIT is essentially optimal, in the sense that there is a conditional lower bound of $n^{3/2}$ for any weak isolation level between RC and CC. Our experiments show that AWDIT is significantly faster than existing, highly optimized testers; e.g., for the $\sim$20% largest histories, AWDIT obtains an average speedup of $245\times$, $193\times$, and $62\times$ for RC, RA, and CC, respectively, over the best baseline.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06975v1
Lobster: A GPU-Accelerated Framework for Neurosymbolic Programming,"Neurosymbolic programs combine deep learning with symbolic reasoning to achieve better data efficiency, interpretability, and generalizability compared to standalone deep learning approaches. However, existing neurosymbolic learning frameworks implement an uneasy marriage between a highly scalable, GPU-accelerated neural component with a slower symbolic component that runs on CPUs. We propose Lobster, a unified framework for harnessing GPUs in an end-to-end manner for neurosymbolic learning. Lobster maps a general neurosymbolic language based on Datalog to the GPU programming paradigm. This mapping is implemented via compilation to a new intermediate language called APM. The extra abstraction provided by APM allows Lobster to be both flexible, supporting discrete, probabilistic, and differentiable modes of reasoning on GPU hardware with a library of provenance semirings, and performant, implementing new optimization passes. We demonstrate that Lobster programs can solve interesting problems spanning the domains of natural language processing, image processing, program reasoning, bioinformatics, and planning. On a suite of 8 applications, Lobster achieves an average speedup of 5.3x over Scallop, a state-of-the-art neurosymbolic framework, and enables scaling of neurosymbolic solutions to previously infeasible tasks.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21937v1
Universal Algebra and Effectful Computation,"Abstract clones serve as an algebraic presentation of the syntax of a simple type theory. From the perspective of universal algebra, they define algebraic theories like those of groups, monoids and rings. This link allows one to study the language of simple type theory from the viewpoint of universal algebra.   Programming languages, however, are much more complicated than simple type theory. Many useful features like reading, writing, and exception handling involve interacting with the environment; these are called side-effects. Algebraic presentations for languages with the appropriate syntax for handling effects are given by premulticategories and effectful multicategories. We study these structures with the aim of defining a suitable notion of an algebra.   To achieve this goal, we proceed in two steps. First, we define a tensor on $[\to,\category{Set}]$, and show that this tensor along with the cartesian product gives the category a duoidal structure. Secondly, we introduce the novel notion of a multicategory enriched in a duoidal category which generalize the traditional notion of a multicategory. Further, we prove that an effectful multicategory is the same as a multicategory enriched in the duoidal category $[\to,\category{Set}]$. This result places multicategories and effectful multicategories on a similar footing, and provides a mechanism for transporting concepts from the theory of multicategories (which model pure computation) to the theory of effectful multicategories (which model effectful computation). As an example of this, we generalize the definition of a 2-morphism for multicategories to the duoidally enriched case. Our equivalence result then gives a natural definition of a 2-morphism for effectful multicategories, which we then use to define the notion of an algebra.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10314v1
DR.FIX: Automatically Fixing Data Races at Industry Scale,"Data races are a prevalent class of concurrency bugs in shared-memory parallel programs, posing significant challenges to software reliability and reproducibility. While there is an extensive body of research on detecting data races and a wealth of practical detection tools across various programming languages, considerably less effort has been directed toward automatically fixing data races at an industrial scale. In large codebases, data races are continuously introduced and exhibit myriad patterns, making automated fixing particularly challenging.   In this paper, we tackle the problem of automatically fixing data races at an industrial scale. We present Dr.Fix, a tool that combines large language models (LLMs) with program analysis to generate fixes for data races in real-world settings, effectively addressing a broad spectrum of racy patterns in complex code contexts. Implemented for Go--the programming language widely used in modern microservice architectures where concurrency is pervasive and data races are common--Dr.Fix seamlessly integrates into existing development workflows. We detail the design of Dr.Fix and examine how individual design choices influence the quality of the fixes produced. Over the past 18 months, Dr.Fix has been integrated into developer workflows at Uber demonstrating its practical utility. During this period, Dr.Fix produced patches for 224 (55%) from a corpus of 404 data races spanning various categories; 193 of these patches (86%) were accepted by more than a hundred developers via code reviews and integrated into the codebase.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15637v1
Encode the $\forall\exists$ Relational Hoare Logic into Standard Hoare   Logic,"Verifying a real-world program's functional correctness can be decomposed into (1) a refinement proof showing that the program implements a more abstract high-level program and (2) an algorithm correctness proof at the high level. Relational Hoare logic serves as a powerful tool to establish refinement but often necessitates formalization beyond standard Hoare logic. Particularly in the nondeterministic setting, the $\forall\exists$ relational Hoare logic is required. Existing approaches encode this logic into a Hoare logic with ghost states and invariants, yet these extensions significantly increase formalization complexity and soundness proof overhead. This paper proposes a generic encoding theory that reduces the $\forall\exists$ relational Hoare logic to standard (unary) Hoare logic. Precisely, we propose to redefine the validity of relational Hoare triples while reserving the original proof rules and then encapsulate the $\forall\exists$ pattern within assertions. We have proved that the validity of encoded standard Hoare triples is equivalent to the validity of the desired relational Hoare triples. Moreover, the encoding theory demonstrates how common relational Hoare logic proof rules are indeed special cases of standard Hoare logic proof rules, and relational proof steps correspond to standard proof steps. Our theory enables standard Hoare logic to prove $\forall\exists$ relational properties by defining a predicate Exec, without requiring modifications to the logic framework or re-verification of soundness.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17444v1
Modular Reasoning about Error Bounds for Concurrent Probabilistic   Programs,"We present Coneris, the first higher-order concurrent separation logic for reasoning about error probability bounds of higher-order concurrent probabilistic programs with higher-order state. To support modular reasoning about concurrent (non-probabilistic) program modules, state-of-the-art program logics internalize the classic notion of linearizability within the logic through the concept of logical atomicity.   Coneris extends this idea to probabilistic concurrent program modules. Thus Coneris supports modular reasoning about probabilistic concurrent modules by capturing a novel notion of randomized logical atomicity within the logic. To do so, Coneris utilizes presampling tapes and a novel probabilistic update modality to describe how state is changed probabilistically at linearization points. We demonstrate this approach by means of smaller synthetic examples and larger case studies.   All of the presented results, including the meta-theory, have been mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant and the Iris separation logic framework",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04512v1
Two-sorted algebraic decompositions of Brookes's shared-state   denotational semantics,"We use a two sorted equational theory of algebraic effects to model concurrent shared state with preemptive interleaving, recovering Brookes's seminal 1996 trace-based model precisely. The decomposition allows us to analyse Brookes's model algebraically in terms of separate but interacting components. The multiple sorts partition terms into layers. We use two sorts: a ""hold"" sort for layers that disallow interleaving of environment memory accesses, analogous to holding a global lock on the memory; and a ""cede"" sort for the opposite. The algebraic signature comprises of independent interlocking components: two new operators that switch between these sorts, delimiting the atomic layers, thought of as acquiring and releasing the global lock; non-deterministic choice; and state-accessing operators. The axioms similarly divide cleanly: the delimiters behave as a closure pair; all operators are strict, and distribute over non-empty non-deterministic choice; and non-deterministic global state obeys Plotkin and Power's presentation of global state. Our representation theorem expresses the free algebras over a two-sorted family of variables as sets of traces with suitable closure conditions. When the held sort has no variables, we recover Brookes's trace semantics.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15104v2
The nature of loops in programming,"In program semantics and verification, reasoning about loops is complicated by the need to produce two separate mathematical arguments: an invariant, for functional properties (ignoring termination); and a variant, for termination (ignoring functional properties). A single and simple definition is possible, removing this split. A loop is just the limit (a variant of the reflexive transitive closure) of a Noetherian (well-founded) relation. To prove the loop correct there is no need to devise an invariant and a variant; it suffices to identify the relation, yielding both partial correctness and termination. The present note develops the (small) theory and applies it to standard loop examples and proofs of their correctness.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08126v1
"JustAct+: Justified and Accountable Actions in Policy-Regulated,   Multi-Domain Data Processing","Inter-organisational data exchange is regulated by norms originating from sources ranging from (inter)national laws, to processing agreements, and individual consent. Verifying norm compliance is complex because laws (e.g., GDPR) distribute responsibility and require accountability. Moreover, in some application domains (e.g., healthcare), privacy requirements extend the norms (e.g., patient consent). In contrast, existing solutions such as smart contracts, access- and usage-control assume policies to be public, or otherwise, statically partition policy information at the cost of accountability and flexibility. Instead, our framework prescribes how decentralised agents justify their actions with policy fragments that the agents autonomously create, gossip, and assemble. Crucially, the permission of actions is always reproducible by any observer, even with a partial view of all the dynamic policies. Actors can be sure that future auditors will confirm their permissions. Systems centralise control by (re)configuring externally synchronised agreements, the bases of all justifications. As a result, control is centralised only to the extent desired by the agents.   In this paper, we define the JustAct framework, detail its implementation in a particular data-processing system, and design a suitable policy language based on logic programming. A case study reproduces Brane - an existing policy-regulated, inter-domain, medical data processing system - and serves to demonstrate and assess the qualities of the framework.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00138v1
Graphiti: Bridging Graph and Relational Database Queries,"This paper presents an automated reasoning technique for checking equivalence between graph database queries written in Cypher and relational queries in SQL. To formalize a suitable notion of equivalence in this setting, we introduce the concept of database transformers, which transform database instances between graph and relational models. We then propose a novel verification methodology that checks equivalence modulo a given transformer by reducing the original problem to verifying equivalence between a pair of SQL queries. This reduction is achieved by embedding a subset of Cypher into SQL through syntax-directed translation, allowing us to leverage existing research on automated reasoning for SQL while obviating the need for reasoning simultaneously over two different data models. We have implemented our approach in a tool called Graphiti and used it to check equivalence between graph and relational queries. Our experiments demonstrate that Graphiti is useful both for verification and refutation and that it can uncover subtle bugs, including those found in Cypher tutorials and academic papers.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03182v1
"A Practical Quantum Hoare Logic with Classical Variables, I","In this paper, we present a Hoare-style logic for reasoning about quantum programs with classical variables. Our approach offers several improvements over previous work:   (1) Enhanced expressivity of the programming language: Our logic applies to quantum programs with classical variables that incorporate quantum arrays and parameterised quantum gates, which have not been addressed in previous research on quantum Hoare logic, either with or without classical variables.   (2) Intuitive correctness specifications: In our logic, preconditions and postconditions for quantum programs with classical variables are specified as a pair consisting of a classical first-order logical formula and a quantum predicate formula (possibly parameterised by classical variables). These specifications offer greater clarity and align more closely with the programmer's intuitive understanding of quantum and classical interactions.   (3) Simplified proof system: By introducing a novel idea in formulating a proof rule for reasoning about quantum measurements, along with (2), we develop a proof system for quantum programs that requires only minimal modifications to classical Hoare logic. Furthermore, this proof system can be effectively and conveniently combined with classical first-order logic to verify quantum programs with classical variables.   As a result, the learning curve for quantum program verification techniques is significantly reduced for those already familiar with classical program verification techniques, and existing tools for verifying classical programs can be more easily adapted for quantum program verification.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09869v1
Complete the Cycle: Reachability Types with Expressive Cyclic References,"Reachability Types (RT) are a qualified type system for tracking aliasing and separation in functional and higher-order programming. By formalizing resource reachability with a sound static type system, RT enable higher-order programming patterns with runtime safety and non-interference guarantees. However, previous RT systems have been based on calculi that restrict cyclic dependencies and are shown to be terminating in the absence of built-in recursive constructs. While termination is sometimes a desirable property, simplifying reasoning and ensuring predictable behavior, it implies an inability to encode expressive programs involving non-termination and advanced recursive patterns, such as mutual recursion and various fixed-point combinators.   In this paper, we address this limitation by extending RT with an expressive cyclic reference type that permits the formation of cyclic dependencies through the store, thereby allowing the system to encode recursive programming patterns without relying on extra built-in constructs. In addition, we redesign qualifier typing in the reference introduction rule, allowing separate references to point to a shared and tracked referent. We formalize the system as the $\lambda^{\circ}_{<:}$-calculus, with a mechanized soundness proof via the standard progress and preservation lemmas. As a demonstration, we implement a well-typed fixpoint operator, proving that recursive patterns can be encoded using the novel cyclic reference type.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07328v1
VEL: A Formally Verified Reasoner for OWL2 EL Profile,"Over the past two decades, the Web Ontology Language (OWL) has been instrumental in advancing the development of ontologies and knowledge graphs, providing a structured framework that enhances the semantic integration of data. However, the reliability of deductive reasoning within these systems remains challenging, as evidenced by inconsistencies among popular reasoners in recent competitions. This evidence underscores the limitations of current testing-based methodologies, particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we have developed VEL, a formally verified EL++ reasoner equipped with machine-checkable correctness proofs that ensure the validity of outputs across all possible inputs. This formalization, based on the algorithm of Baader et al., has been transformed into executable OCaml code using the Coq proof assistant's extraction capabilities. Our formalization revealed several errors in the original completeness proofs, which led to changes to the algorithm to ensure its completeness. Our work demonstrates the necessity of mechanization of reasoning algorithms to ensure their correctness at theoretical and implementation levels.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08739v1
Finding Missed Code Size Optimizations in Compilers using LLMs,"Compilers are complex, and significant effort has been expended on testing them. Techniques such as random program generation and differential testing have proved highly effective and have uncovered thousands of bugs in production compilers. The majority of effort has been expended on validating that a compiler produces correct code for a given input, while less attention has been paid to ensuring that the compiler produces performant code.   In this work we adapt differential testing to the task of identifying missed optimization opportunities in compilers. We develop a novel testing approach which combines large language models (LLMs) with a series of differential testing strategies and use them to find missing code size optimizations in C / C++ compilers.   The advantage of our approach is its simplicity. We offload the complex task of generating random code to an off-the-shelf LLM, and use heuristics and analyses to identify anomalous compiler behavior. Our approach requires fewer than 150 lines of code to implement. This simplicity makes it extensible. By simply changing the target compiler and initial LLM prompt we port the approach from C / C++ to Rust and Swift, finding bugs in both. To date we have reported 24 confirmed bugs in production compilers, and conclude that LLM-assisted testing is a promising avenue for detecting optimization bugs in real world compilers.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00655v1
Shedding Light in Task Decomposition in Program Synthesis: The Driving   Force of the Synthesizer Model,"Task decomposition is a fundamental mechanism in program synthesis, enabling complex problems to be broken down into manageable subtasks. ExeDec, a state-of-the-art program synthesis framework, employs this approach by combining a Subgoal Model for decomposition and a Synthesizer Model for program generation to facilitate compositional generalization. In this work, we develop REGISM, an adaptation of ExeDec that removes decomposition guidance and relies solely on iterative execution-driven synthesis. By comparing these two exemplary approaches-ExeDec, which leverages task decomposition, and REGISM, which does not-we investigate the interplay between task decomposition and program generation. Our findings indicate that ExeDec exhibits significant advantages in length generalization and concept composition tasks, likely due to its explicit decomposition strategies. At the same time, REGISM frequently matches or surpasses ExeDec's performance across various scenarios, with its solutions often aligning more closely with ground truth decompositions. These observations highlight the importance of repeated execution-guided synthesis in driving task-solving performance, even within frameworks that incorporate explicit decomposition strategies. Our analysis suggests that task decomposition approaches like ExeDec hold significant potential for advancing program synthesis, though further work is needed to clarify when and why these strategies are most effective.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08738v3

To tame the search space blowup, previous works introduced probabilistic and neural approaches to guide this combinatorial search by inducing heuristic cost functions. Best-first search algorithms ensure to search in the exact order induced by the cost function, significantly reducing the portion of the program space to be explored. We present a new best-first search algorithm called EcoSearch, which is the first constant-delay algorithm for pre-generation cost function: the amount of compute required between outputting two programs is constant, and in particular does not increase over time. This key property yields important speedups: we observe that EcoSearch outperforms its predecessors on two classic domains.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17330v1
Comparing Parallel Functional Array Languages: Programming and   Performance,"Parallel functional array languages are an emerging class of programming languages that promise to combine low-effort parallel programming with good performance and performance portability. We systematically compare the designs and implementations of five different functional array languages: Accelerate, APL, DaCe, Futhark, and SaC. We demonstrate the expressiveness of functional array programming by means of four challenging benchmarks, namely N-body simulation, MultiGrid, Quickhull, and Flash Attention. These benchmarks represent a range of application domains and parallel computational models. We argue that the functional array code is much shorter and more comprehensible than the hand-optimized baseline implementations because it omits architecture-specific aspects. Instead, the language implementations generate both multicore and GPU executables from a single source code base. Hence, we further argue that functional array code could more easily be ported to, and optimized for, new parallel architectures than conventional implementations of numerical kernels. We demonstrate this potential by reporting the performance of the five parallel functional array languages on a total of 39 instances of the four benchmarks on both a 32-core AMD EPYC 7313 multicore system and on an NVIDIA A30 GPU. We explore in-depth why each language performs well or not so well on each benchmark and architecture. We argue that the results demonstrate that mature functional array languages have the potential to deliver performance competitive with the best available conventional techniques.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08906v1
CodeARC: Benchmarking Reasoning Capabilities of LLM Agents for Inductive   Program Synthesis,"Inductive program synthesis, or programming by example, requires synthesizing functions from input-output examples that generalize to unseen inputs. While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain. CodeARC provides a more realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating LLM-based program synthesis and inductive reasoning.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23145v1
BaxBench: Can LLMs Generate Correct and Secure Backends?,"The automatic generation of programs has long been a fundamental challenge in computer science. Recent benchmarks have shown that large language models (LLMs) can effectively generate code at the function level, make code edits, and solve algorithmic coding tasks. However, to achieve full automation, LLMs should be able to generate production-quality, self-contained application modules. To evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in solving this challenge, we introduce BaxBench, a novel evaluation benchmark consisting of 392 tasks for the generation of backend applications. We focus on backends for three critical reasons: (i) they are practically relevant, building the core components of most modern web and cloud software, (ii) they are difficult to get right, requiring multiple functions and files to achieve the desired functionality, and (iii) they are security-critical, as they are exposed to untrusted third-parties, making secure solutions that prevent deployment-time attacks an imperative. BaxBench validates the functionality of the generated applications with comprehensive test cases, and assesses their security exposure by executing end-to-end exploits. Our experiments reveal key limitations of current LLMs in both functionality and security: (i) even the best model, OpenAI o1, achieves a mere 60% on code correctness; (ii) on average, we could successfully execute security exploits on more than half of the correct programs generated by each LLM; and (iii) in less popular backend frameworks, models further struggle to generate correct and secure applications. Progress on BaxBench signifies important steps towards autonomous and secure software development with LLMs.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11844v2
Modular probabilistic programming with algebraic effects (MSc Thesis   2019),"Probabilistic programming languages, which exist in abundance, are languages that allow users to calculate probability distributions defined by probabilistic programs, by using inference algorithms. However, the underlying inference algorithms are not implemented in a modular fashion, though, the algorithms are presented as a composition of other inference components. This discordance between the theory and the practice of Bayesian machine learning, means that reasoning about the correctness of probabilistic programs is more difficult, and composing inference algorithms together in code may not necessarily produce correct compound inference algorithms. In this dissertation, I create a modular probabilistic programming library, already a nice property as its not a standalone language, called Koka Bayes, that is based off of both the modular design of Monad Bayes -- a probabilistic programming library developed in Haskell -- and its semantic validation. The library is embedded in a recently created programming language, Koka, that supports algebraic effect handlers and expressive effect types -- novel programming abstractions that support modular programming. Effects are generalizations of computational side-effects, and it turns out that fundamental operations in probabilistic programming such as probabilistic choice and conditioning are instances of effects.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19826v1
Gray-Box Fuzzing in Local Space,"We consider gray-box fuzzing of a program instrumented such that information about evaluation of program expressions converting values of numerical types to Boolean, like x <= y, is recorded during each program's execution. Given that information for an executed program path, we formally define the problem for finding input such that program's execution with that input evaluates all those expressions in the same order and with the same Boolean values as in the original execution path, except for the last one, which is evaluated to the opposite value. Then we also provide an algorithm searching for a solution of the problem effectively. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated empirically via its evaluation on the TestComp 2024 benchmark suite.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18046v1
Picachv: Formally Verified Data Use Policy Enforcement for Secure Data   Analytics,"Ensuring the proper use of sensitive data in analytics under complex privacy policies is an increasingly critical challenge. Many existing approaches lack portability, verifiability, and scalability across diverse data processing frameworks. We introduce Picachv, a novel security monitor that automatically enforces data use policies. It works on relational algebra as an abstraction for program semantics, enabling policy enforcement on query plans generated by programs during execution. This approach simplifies analysis across diverse analytical operations and supports various front-end query languages. By formalizing both data use policies and relational algebra semantics in Coq, we prove that Picachv correctly enforces policies. Picachv also leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to enhance trust in runtime, providing provable policy compliance to stakeholders that the analytical tasks comply with their data use policies. We integrated Picachv into Polars, a state-of-the-art data analytics framework, and evaluate its performance using the TPC-H benchmark. We also apply our approach to real-world use cases. Our work demonstrates the practical application of formal methods in securing data analytics, addressing key challenges.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10560v1
From Code Generation to Software Testing: AI Copilot with Context-Based   RAG,"The rapid pace of large-scale software development places increasing demands on traditional testing methodologies, often leading to bottlenecks in efficiency, accuracy, and coverage. We propose a novel perspective on software testing by positing bug detection and coding with fewer bugs as two interconnected problems that share a common goal, which is reducing bugs with limited resources. We extend our previous work on AI-assisted programming, which supports code auto-completion and chatbot-powered Q&A, to the realm of software testing. We introduce Copilot for Testing, an automated testing system that synchronizes bug detection with codebase updates, leveraging context-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Our evaluation demonstrates a 31.2% improvement in bug detection accuracy, a 12.6% increase in critical test coverage, and a 10.5% higher user acceptance rate, highlighting the transformative potential of AI-driven technologies in modern software development practices.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01866v2
Classical notions of computation and the Hasegawa-Thielecke theorem,"In the spirit of the Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and programs, we define and study a syntax and semantics for classical logic equipped with a computationally involutive negation, using a polarised effect calculus. A main challenge in designing a denotational semantics is to accommodate both call-by-value and call-by-name evaluation strategies, which leads to a failure of associativity of composition. Building on the work of the third author, we devise the notion of dialogue duploid, which provides a non-associative and effectful counterpart to the notion of dialogue category introduced by the second author in his 2-categorical account, based on adjunctions, of logical polarities and continuations. We show that the syntax of the polarised calculus can be interpreted in any dialogue duploid, and that it defines in fact a syntactic dialogue duploid. As an application, we establish, by semantic as well as syntactic means, the Hasegawa-Thielecke theorem, which states that the notions of central map and of thunkable map coincide in any dialogue duploid (in particular, for any double negation monad on a symmetric monoidal category).",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13033v1
Incremental Bidirectional Typing via Order Maintenance,"Live programming environments provide various semantic services, including type checking and evaluation, continuously as the user is editing the program. The live paradigm promises to improve the developer experience, but liveness is an implementation challenge particularly when working with large programs. This paper specifies and efficiently implements a system the is able to incrementally update type information for a live program in response to fine-grained program edits. This information includes type error marks and information about the expected and actual type on every expression. The system is specified type-theoretically as a small-step dynamics that propagates updates through the marked and annotated program. Most updates flow according to a base bidirectional type system. Additional pointers are maintained to connect bound variables to their binding locations, with edits traversing these pointers directly. Order maintenance data structures are employed to efficiently maintain these pointers and to prioritize the order of update propagation. We prove this system is equivalent to naive re-analysis in the Agda theorem prover, along with other important metatheoretic properties. We then implement it efficiently in OCaml, detailing a number of impactful optimizations. We evaluate this implementation's performance with a large stress-test and find that it is able to achieve dramatic speed-ups of 275.96$\times$ compared to from-scratch reanalysis.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08946v1

It provides a structured benchmark for evaluating specification inference tools and testing theaccuracy of generated specifications. Researchers and developers can use this dataset to benchmark specification inference tools,fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated specification generation, and analyze the role of formal specifications in improving program verification and automated testing. By making this dataset publicly available, we aim to advance research in program verification, specification inference, and AI-assisted software development.

Can LLMs Enable Verification in Mainstream Programming?,"Although formal methods are capable of producing reliable software, they have seen minimal adoption in everyday programming. Automatic code generation using large language models is becoming increasingly widespread, but it rarely considers producing strong correctness guarantees. In this study, we explore the ability of LLMs to produce verified code in three verification languages (Dafny, Nagini, and Verus). To do so, we use manually curated datasets derived from the state-ofthe-art Python benchmark, HumanEval. We also assess what types of information are sufficient to achieve good-quality results.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14183v1

This new paradigm introduces new challenges in compilation, namely synthesizing circuits from basis translations and automatically specializing adjoint or predicated forms of functions. This paper presents ASDF, an open-source compiler for Qwerty that answers these challenges in compiling basis-oriented languages. Enabled with a novel high-level quantum IR implemented in the MLIR framework, our compiler produces OpenQASM 3 or QIR for either simulation or execution on hardware. Our compiler is evaluated by comparing the fault-tolerant resource requirements of generated circuits with other compilers, finding that ASDF produces circuits with comparable cost to prior circuit-oriented compilers.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13262v1
Program Semantic Inequivalence Game with Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve strong performance on everyday coding tasks, but they can fail on complex tasks that require non-trivial reasoning about program semantics. Finding training examples to teach LLMs to solve these tasks can be challenging.   In this work, we explore a method to synthetically generate code reasoning training data based on a semantic inequivalence game SInQ: a generator agent creates program variants that are semantically distinct, derived from a dataset of real-world programming tasks, while an evaluator agent has to identify input examples that cause the original programs and the generated variants to diverge in their behaviour, with the agents training each other semi-adversarially. We prove that this setup enables theoretically unlimited improvement through self-play in the limit of infinite computational resources.   We evaluated our approach on multiple code generation and understanding benchmarks, including cross-language vulnerability detection (Lu et al., 2021), where our method improves vulnerability detection in C/C++ code despite being trained exclusively on Python code, and the challenging Python builtin identifier swap benchmark (Miceli-Barone et al., 2023), showing that whereas modern LLMs still struggle with this benchmark, our approach yields substantial improvements.   We release the code needed to replicate the experiments, as well as the generated synthetic data, which can be used to fine-tune LLMs.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03818v1
Hercules: A Compiler for Productive Programming of Heterogeneous Systems,"Modern computing systems increasingly rely on composing heterogeneous devices to improve performance and efficiency. Programming these systems is often unproductive: algorithm implementations must be coupled to system-specific logic, including device-specific optimizations, partitioning, and inter-device communication and synchronization, which requires developing different programs for different system configurations. We propose the Juno language, which represents general purpose applications in an imperative form that can be transformed into parallel, optimized, system-specific code using an expressive and granular imperative scheduling language. We also introduce the Hercules compiler, which uses a novel intermediate representation to represent general and device-specific parallel code in a manner that is easy to analyze and manipulate using schedules. Our system achieves competitive performance with hand-optimized device-specific code (geomean speedups of $1.25\times$ and $1.48\times$ on the CPU and GPU) and significantly outperforms a prior general purpose heterogeneous programming system (geomean speedups of $9.31\times$ and $16.18\times$ on the CPU and GPU).",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10855v1
Precise Static Identification of Ethereum Storage Variables,"Smart contracts are small programs that run autonomously on the blockchain, using it as their persistent memory. The predominant platform for smart contracts is the Ethereum VM (EVM). In EVM smart contracts, a problem with significant applications is to identify data structures (in blockchain state, a.k.a. ""storage""), given only the deployed smart contract code. The problem has been highly challenging and has often been considered nearly impossible to address satisfactorily. (For reference, the latest state-of-the-art research tool fails to recover nearly all complex data structures and scales to under 50% of contracts.) Much of the complication is that the main on-chain data structures (mappings and arrays) have their locations derived dynamically through code execution.   We propose sophisticated static analysis techniques to solve the identification of on-chain data structures with extremely high fidelity and completeness. Our analysis scales nearly universally and recovers deep data structures. Our techniques are able to identify the exact types of data structures with 98.6% precision and at least 92.6% recall, compared to a state-of-the-art tool managing 80.8% and 68.2% respectively. Strikingly, the analysis is often more complete than the storage description that the compiler itself produces, with full access to the source code.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20690v1
SynQ: An Embedded DSL for Synchronous System Design with Quantitative   Types,"System design automation aims to manage the design of embedded systems with ever-increasing complexity. To the success of system design automation, there is still a lack of systematic and formal design process because an entire design process, from a system's specification to its implementation, has to deal with inherent concerns about the systems' different aspects and, consequently, inherent semantic gaps. These gaps make it hard for a design process to be traceable or transparent. Particularly, guaranteeing the correctness of produced implementations becomes the main challenge for a system design process.   SynQ (Synchronous system design with Quantitative types) is an embedded domain specification language (EDSL) targeting the design of systems obeying the perfect synchrony hypothesis. SynQ is based on a component-based design framework and, by design, facilitates semantic coherency by leveraging the quantitative type theory (QTT) and language embedding. SynQ enables a semantically coherent design process, including formal specification and verification, modelling, simulation and code generation. This paper presents SynQ and its underlying formalism and demonstrates its features and potential for semantically coherent system design through a case study.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02883v1
Hexcute: A Tile-based Programming Language with Automatic Layout and   Task-Mapping Synthesis,"Deep learning (DL) workloads mainly run on accelerators like GPUs. Recent DL quantization techniques demand a new matrix multiplication operator with mixed input data types, further complicating GPU optimization. Prior high-level compilers like Triton lack the expressiveness to implement key optimizations like fine-grained data pipelines and hardware-friendly memory layouts for these operators, while low-level programming models, such as Hidet, Graphene, and CUTLASS, require significant programming efforts. To balance expressiveness with engineering effort, we propose Hexcute, a tile-based programming language that exposes shared memory and register abstractions to enable fine-grained optimization for these operators. Additionally, Hexcute leverages task mapping to schedule the GPU program, and to reduce programming efforts, it automates layout and task mapping synthesis with a novel type-inference-based algorithm. Our evaluation shows that Hexcute generalizes to a wide range of DL operators, achieves 1.7-11.28$\times$ speedup over existing DL compilers for mixed-type operators, and brings up to 2.91$\times$ speedup in the end-to-end evaluation.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16214v2
Program Synthesis From Partial Traces,"We present the first technique to synthesize programs that compose side-effecting functions, pure functions, and control flow, from partial traces containing records of only the side-effecting functions. This technique can be applied to synthesize API composing scripts from logs of calls made to those APIs, or a script from traces of system calls made by a workload, for example. All of the provided traces are positive examples, meaning that they describe desired behavior. Our approach does not require negative examples. Instead, it generalizes over the examples and uses cost metrics to prevent over-generalization. Because the problem is too complex for traditional monolithic program synthesis techniques, we propose a new combination of optimizing rewrites and syntax-guided program synthesis. The resulting program is correct by construction, so its output will always be able to reproduce the input traces. We evaluate the quality of the programs synthesized when considering various optimization metrics and the synthesizer's efficiency on real-world benchmarks. The results show that our approach can generate useful real-world programs.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14480v2
Text2Model: Generating dynamic chemical reactor models using large   language models (LLMs),"As large language models have shown remarkable capabilities in conversing via natural language, the question arises as to how LLMs could potentially assist chemical engineers in research and industry with domain-specific tasks. We generate dynamic chemical reactor models in Modelica code format from textual descriptions as user input. We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B Instruct on synthetically generated Modelica code for different reactor scenarios. We compare the performance of our fine-tuned model to the baseline Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model and GPT4o. We manually assess the models' predictions regarding the syntactic and semantic accuracy of the generated dynamic models. We find that considerable improvements are achieved by the fine-tuned model with respect to both the semantic and the syntactic accuracy of the Modelica models. However, the fine-tuned model lacks a satisfactory ability to generalize to unseen scenarios compared to GPT4o.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17004v1
Testing Message-Passing Concurrency,"A key computational question underpinning the automated testing and verification of concurrent programs is the \emph{consistency question} -- \emph{given a partial execution history, can it be completed in a consistent manner?} Due to its importance, consistency testing has been studied extensively for memory models, as well as for database isolation levels. A common theme in all these settings is the use of shared-memory as the primal mode of interthread communication. On the other hand, modern programming languages, such as Go, Rust and Kotlin, advocate a paradigm shift towards channel-based (i.e., message-passing) communication. However, the consistency question for channel-based concurrency is currently poorly understood.   In this paper we lift the study of fundamental consistency problems to channels, taking into account various input parameters, such as the number of threads executing, the number of channels, and the channel capacities. We draw a rich complexity landscape, including upper bounds that become polynomial when certain input parameters are fixed, as well as hardness lower bounds. Our upper bounds are based on novel algorithms that can drive the verification of channel consistency in automated verification tools. Our lower bounds characterize minimal input parameters that are sufficient for hardness to arise, and thus shed light on the intricacies of testing channel-based concurrency. In combination, our upper and lower bounds characterize the boundary of \emph{tractability/intractability} of verifying channel consistency, and imply that our algorithms are often (nearly) optimal.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05162v1
Scaling Inter-procedural Dataflow Analysis on the Cloud,"Apart from forming the backbone of compiler optimization, static dataflow analysis has been widely applied in a vast variety of applications, such as bug detection, privacy analysis, program comprehension, etc. Despite its importance, performing interprocedural dataflow analysis on large-scale programs is well known to be challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed analysis framework supporting the general interprocedural dataflow analysis. Inspired by large-scale graph processing, we devise dedicated distributed worklist algorithms for both whole-program analysis and incremental analysis. We implement these algorithms and develop a distributed framework called BigDataflow running on a large-scale cluster. The experimental results validate the promising performance of BigDataflow -- BigDataflow can finish analyzing the program of millions lines of code in minutes. Compared with the state-of-the-art, BigDataflow achieves much more analysis efficiency.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12579v1
Developing a Modular Compiler for a Subset of a C-like Language,"The paper introduces the development of a modular compiler for a subset of a C-like language, which addresses the challenges in constructing a compiler for high-level languages. This modular approach will allow developers to modify a language by adding or removing subsets as required, resulting in a minimal and memory-efficient compiler. The development process is divided into small, incremental steps, where each step yields a fully functioning compiler for an expanding subset of the language. The paper outlines the iterative developmental phase of the compiler, emphasizing progressive enhancements in capabilities and functionality. Adherence to industry best practices of modular design, code reusability, and documentation has enabled the resulting compiler's functional efficiency, maintainability, and extensibility. The compiler proved to be effective not only in managing the language structure but also in developing optimized code, which demonstrates its practical usability. This was also further assessed using the compiler on a tiny memory-deficient single-board computer, again showing the compiler's efficiency and suitability for resource-constrained devices.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04503v1
Verifying Graph Algorithms in Separation Logic: A Case for an Algebraic   Approach (Extended Version),"Specifying and verifying graph-manipulating programs is a well-known and persistent challenge in separation logic. We show that the obstacles in dealing with graphs are removed if one represents graphs as partial commutative monoids, and admits applying over them structure-preserving functions (i.e., morphisms), including higher-order ones (i.e., combinators).   By distributing over the monoid operations, morphisms work in tandem with framing to propagate the low-level pointer manipulation to the more abstract level of mathematical graphs, and to reduce the reasoning about the whole graph to reasoning about sub-components. We illustrate the approach with a novel and concise proof of a well-known graph benchmark, the Schorr-Waite graph marking algorithm.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13603v1
Conversation Routines: A Prompt Engineering Framework for Task-Oriented   Dialog Systems,"This study introduces Conversation Routines (CR), a structured prompt engineering framework for developing task-oriented dialog systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable natural language understanding capabilities, engineering them to reliably execute complex business workflows remains challenging. The proposed CR framework enables the development of Conversation Agentic Systems (CAS) through natural language specifications, embedding task-oriented logic within LLM prompts. This approach provides a systematic methodology for designing and implementing complex conversational workflows while maintaining behavioral consistency. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through two proof-of-concept implementations: a Train Ticket Booking System and an Interactive Troubleshooting Copilot. These case studies validate CR's capability to encode sophisticated behavioral patterns and decision logic while preserving natural conversational flexibility. Results show that CR enables domain experts to design conversational workflows in natural language while leveraging custom functions (tools) developed by software engineers, creating an efficient division of responsibilities where developers focus on core API implementation and domain experts handle conversation design. While the framework shows promise in accessibility and adaptability, we identify key challenges including computational overhead, non-deterministic behavior, and domain-specific logic optimization. Future research directions include CR evaluation methods based on prompt engineering frameworks driven by goal-oriented grading criteria, improving scalability for complex multi-agent interactions, and enhancing system robustness to address the identified limitations across diverse business applications.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11613v7
Productive Quantum Programming Needs Better Abstract Machines,"An effective, accessible abstraction hierarchy has made using and programming computers possible for people across all disciplines. Establishing such a hierarchy for quantum programming is an outstanding challenge, especially due to a proliferation of different conventions and the rapid pace of innovation. One critical portion of the hierarchy is the abstract machine, the layer that separates a programmer's mental model of the hardware from its physical realization. Drawing on historical parallels in classical computing, we explain why having the ""right"" quantum abstract machine (QAM) is essential for making progress in the field and propose a novel framework for evaluating QAMs based on a set of desirable criteria. These criteria capture aspects of a QAM such as universality, compactness, expressiveness, and composability, which aid in the representation of quantum programs. By defining this framework we take steps toward defining an optimal QAM. We further apply our framework to survey the landscape of existing proposals, draw comparisons, and assess them based on our criteria. While these proposals share many common strengths, we find that each falls short of our ideal. Our framework and our findings set a direction for subsequent efforts to define a future QAM that is both straightforward to map to a variety of quantum computers, and provides a stable abstraction for quantum software development.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00718v1
Taking out the Toxic Trash: Recovering Precision in Mixed Flow-Sensitive   Static Analyses,"Static analysis of real-world programs combines flow- and context-sensitive analyses of local program states with computation of flow- and context-insensitive invariants at globals, that, e.g., abstract data shared by multiple threads. The values of locals and globals may mutually depend on each other, with the analysis of local program states both making contributions to globals and querying their values. Usually, all contributions to globals are accumulated during fixpoint iteration, with widening applied to enforce termination. Such flow-insensitive information often becomes unnecessarily imprecise and can include superfluous contributions -- trash -- which, in turn, may be toxic to the precision of the overall analysis. To recover precision of globals, we propose techniques complementing each other: Narrowing on globals differentiates contributions by origin; reluctant widening limits the amount of widening applied at globals; and finally, abstract garbage collection undoes contributions to globals and propagates their withdrawal. The experimental evaluation shows that these techniques increase the precision of mixed flow-sensitive analyses at a reasonable cost.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06026v1
System $F^ω$ with Coherent Implicit Resolution,"We propose a calculus for modeling implicit programming that supports first-class, overlapping, locally scoped, and higher-order instances with higher-kinded types.

Equality Saturation for Optimizing High-Level Julia IR,"Compilers are indispensable for transforming code written in high-level languages into performant machine code, but their general-purpose optimizations sometimes fall short. Domain experts might be aware of certain optimizations that the compiler is unable to apply or that are only valid in a particular domain. We have developed a system that allows domain experts to express rewrite rules to optimize code in the Julia programming language. Our system builds on e-graphs and equality saturation. It can apply optimizations in the presence of control flow and side effects. As Julia uses multiple dispatch, we allow users to constrain rewrite rules by argument types, and propagate type information through the e-graph representation. We propose an ILP formulation for optimal e-graph extraction taking into account dominance properties for code reuse and introduce \emph{CFG skeleton relaxation} to rewrite calls to pure functions as well as those with side effects. Use cases demonstrate that our system can perform rewrites on high-level, domain-specific code, as well as on lower-level code such as Julia's broadcasting mechanism. Finally, we analyze the required compilation time.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17075v1
A Compiler for Operations on Relations with Bag Semantics,"We describe an abstract loop-based intermediate representation that can express fused implementations of relational algebra expressions on sets and bags (multisets). The loops are abstracted away from physical data structures thus making it easier to generate, reason about, and perform optimization like fusion on. The IR supports the natural relational algebra as well as complex operators that are used in production database systems, including outer joins, non-equi joins, and differences. We then show how to compile this IR to efficient C++ code that co-iterates over the physical data structures present in the relational algebra expression. Our approach lets us express fusion across disparate operators, leading to a 3.87x speedup (0.77--12.23x) on selected LSQB benchmarks and worst-case optimal triangle queries. We also demonstrate that our compiler generates code of high quality: it has similar sequential performance to Hyper on TPC-H with a 1.00x speedup (0.38--4.34x) and competitive parallel performance with a 0.61x speedup (0.23--1.80x). Finally, our approach is portable across data structures.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06988v1
MCTS-SQL: An Effective Framework for Text-to-SQL with Monte Carlo Tree   Search,"Text-to-SQL is a fundamental and longstanding problem in the NLP area, aiming at converting natural language queries into SQL, enabling non-expert users to operate databases. Recent advances in LLM have greatly improved text-to-SQL performance. However, challenges persist, especially when dealing with complex user queries. Current approaches (e.g., COT prompting and multi-agent frameworks) rely on the ability of models to plan and generate SQL autonomously, but controlling performance remains difficult. In addition, LLMs are still prone to hallucinations. To alleviate these challenges, we designed a novel MCTS-SQL to guide SQL generation iteratively. The approach generates SQL queries through Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a heuristic self-refinement mechanism are used to enhance accuracy and reliability. Key components include a schema selector for extracting relevant information and an MCTS-based generator for iterative query refinement. Experimental results from the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks show that MCTS-SQL achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, on the BIRD development dataset, MCTS-SQL achieves an Execution (EX) accuracy of 69.40% using GPT-4o as the base model and a significant improvement when dealing with challenging tasks, with an EX of 51.48%, which is 3.41% higher than the existing method.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16607v1
Checkification: A Practical Approach for Testing Static Analysis Truths,"Static analysis is an essential component of many modern software development tools. Unfortunately, the ever-increasing complexity of static analyzers makes their coding error-prone. Even analysis tools based on rigorous mathematical techniques, such as abstract interpretation, are not immune to bugs. Ensuring the correctness and reliability of software analyzers is critical if they are to be inserted in production compilers and development environments. While compiler validation has seen notable success, formal validation of static analysis tools remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose a method for testing abstract interpretation-based static analyzers. Broadly, it consists in checking, over a suite of benchmarks, that the properties inferred statically are satisfied dynamically. The main advantage of our approach lies in its simplicity, which stems directly from framing it within the Ciao assertion-based validation framework, and its blended static/dynamic assertion checking approach. We demonstrate that in this setting, the analysis can be tested with little effort by combining the following components already present in the framework: 1) the static analyzer, which outputs its results as the original program source with assertions interspersed; 2) the assertion run-time checking mechanism, which instruments a program to ensure that no assertion is violated at run time; 3) the random test case generator, which generates random test cases satisfying the properties present in assertion preconditions; and 4) the unit-test framework, which executes those test cases. We have applied our approach to the CiaoPP static analyzer, resulting in the identification of many bugs with reasonable overhead. Most of these bugs have been either fixed or confirmed, helping us detect a range of errors not only related to analysis soundness but also within other aspects of the framework.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12093v3
Unleashing Optimizations in Dynamic Circuits through Branch Expansion,"Dynamic quantum circuits enable adaptive operations through intermediate measurements and classical feedback. Current transpilation toolchains, such as Qiskit and T$\ket{\text{ket}}$, however, fail to fully exploit branch-specific simplifications. In this work, we propose recursive branch expansion as a novel technique which systematically expands and refines conditional branches. Our method complements existing transpilers by creating additional opportunities for branch-specific simplifications without altering the overall circuit functionality. Using randomly generated circuits with varying patterns and scales, we demonstrate that our method consistently reduces the depth and gate count of execution paths of dynamic circuits. We also showcase the potential of our method to enable optimizations on error-corrected circuits.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09234v1
Optimization Framework for Reducing Mid-circuit Measurements and Resets,"The paper addresses the optimization of dynamic circuits in quantum computing, with a focus on reducing the cost of mid-circuit measurements and resets. We extend the probabilistic circuit model (PCM) and implement an optimization framework that targets both mid-circuit measurements and resets. To overcome the limitation of the prior PCM-based pass, where optimizations are only possible on pure single-qubit states, we incorporate circuit synthesis to enable optimizations on multi-qubit states. With a parameter $n_{pcm}$, our framework balances optimization level against resource usage.We evaluate our framework using a large dataset of randomly generated dynamic circuits. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is highly effective in reducing mid-circuit measurements and resets. In our demonstrative example, when applying our optimization framework to the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm after employing qubit reuse, we significantly reduce its runtime overhead by removing all of the resets.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16579v1
Iterating Pointers: Enabling Static Analysis for Loop-based Pointers,"Pointers are an integral part of C and other programming languages. They enable substantial flexibility from the programmer's standpoint, allowing the user fine, unmediated control over data access patterns. However, accesses done through pointers are often hard to track, and challenging to understand for optimizers, compilers, and sometimes, even for the developers themselves because of the direct memory access they provide. We alleviate this problem by exposing additional information to analyzers and compilers. By separating the concept of a pointer into a data container and an offset, we can optimize C programs beyond what other state-of-the-art approaches are capable of, in some cases even enabling auto-parallelization. Using this process, we are able to successfully analyze and optimize code from OpenSSL, the Mantevo benchmark suite, and the Lempel-Ziv-Oberhumer compression algorithm. We provide the only automatic approach able to find all parallelization opportunities in the HPCCG benchmark from the Mantevo suite the developers identified and even outperform the reference implementation by up to 18%, as well as speed up the PBKDF2 algorithm implementation from OpenSSL by up to 11x.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03359v1
RepoAudit: An Autonomous LLM-Agent for Repository-Level Code Auditing,"Code auditing is a code review process with the goal of finding bugs. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial potential in this task, offering the ability to analyze programs without compilation and enabling customized bug detection following specified prompts. However, applying LLMs to repository-level code auditing presents notable challenges. The inherent context limits and hallucinations of LLMs can lead to the low quality of bug reports. Meanwhile, the large size of software repositories introduces substantial time and token costs, hindering efficiency and scalability in real-world scenarios. This work introduces an autonomous LLM-agent, RepoAudit, designed to enable precise and efficient repository-level code auditing. Equipped with the agent memory, RepoAudit explores the code repository on demand, analyzing data-flow facts along different feasible program paths in individual functions. It also introduces the validator to check the data-flow facts for hallucination mitigation and examine the satisfiability of path conditions of potential buggy paths, which enables RepoAudit to discard false positives in the code auditing. Our experiment shows that RepoAudit powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet successfully finds 38 true bugs in 15 real-world systems, consuming 0.44 hours and $2.54 per project on average.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18160v2
PromptV: Leveraging LLM-powered Multi-Agent Prompting for High-quality   Verilog Generation,"Recent advances in agentic LLMs have demonstrated remarkable automated Verilog code generation capabilities. However, existing approaches either demand substantial computational resources or rely on LLM-assisted single-agent prompt learning techniques, which we observe for the first time has a degeneration issue - characterized by deteriorating generative performance and diminished error detection and correction capabilities. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent prompt learning framework to address these limitations and enhance code generation quality. We show for the first time that multi-agent architectures can effectively mitigate the degeneration risk while improving code error correction capabilities, resulting in higher-quality Verilog code generation. Experimental results show that the proposed method could achieve 96.4% and 96.5% pass@10 scores on VerilogEval Machine and Human benchmarks, respectively while attaining 100% Syntax and 99.9% Functionality pass@5 metrics on the RTLLM benchmark.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11014v1
Place Capability Graphs: A General-Purpose Model of Rust's Ownership and   Borrowing Guarantees,"Rust's novel type system has proved an attractive target for verification and program analysis tools, due to the rich guarantees it provides for controlling aliasing and mutability. However, fully understanding, extracting and exploiting these guarantees is subtle and challenging: existing models for Rust's type checking either support a smaller idealised language disconnected from real-world Rust code, or come with severe limitations in terms of precise modelling of Rust borrows, composite types storing them, function signatures and loops.   In this paper, we present a novel model of Rust's type-checking called Place Capability Graphs, which lifts these limitations, and which can be directly calculated from the Rust compiler's own programmatic representations and analyses. We demonstrate that our model supports over 98% of Rust functions in the most popular public crates, and show its suitability as a general-purpose basis for verification and program analysis tools by developing promising new prototype versions of the existing Flowistry and Prusti tools.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21691v2
"What I cannot execute, I do not understand: Training and Evaluating LLMs   on Program Execution Traces","Code generation and understanding are critical capabilities for large language models (LLMs). Thus, most LLMs are pretrained and fine-tuned on code data. However, these datasets typically treat code as static strings and rarely exploit the dynamic information about their execution. Building upon previous work on trace modeling, we study Execution Tuning (E.T.), a training procedure in which we explicitly model real-world program execution traces without requiring manual test annotations. We train and evaluate models on different execution trace granularities (line and instruction-level) and strategies on the task of output prediction, obtaining around 80% accuracy on CruxEval and MBPP, and showing the advantages of dynamic scratchpads (i.e., self-contained intermediate computations updated by the model rather than accumulated as a history of past computations) on long executions (up to 14k steps). Finally, we discuss E.T.'s practical applications.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05703v1
PHOENIX: Pauli-Based High-Level Optimization Engine for Instruction   Execution on NISQ Devices,"Variational quantum algorithms (VQA) based on Hamiltonian simulation represent a specialized class of quantum programs well-suited for near-term quantum computing applications due to its modest resource requirements in terms of qubits and circuit depth. Unlike the conventional single-qubit (1Q) and two-qubit (2Q) gate sequence representation, Hamiltonian simulation programs are essentially composed of disciplined subroutines known as Pauli exponentiations (Pauli strings with coefficients) that are variably arranged. To capitalize on these distinct program features, this study introduces PHOENIX, a highly effective compilation framework that primarily operates at the high-level Pauli-based intermediate representation (IR) for generic Hamiltonian simulation programs. PHOENIX exploits global program optimization opportunities to the greatest extent, compared to existing SOTA methods despite some of them also utilizing similar IRs. PHOENIX employs the binary symplectic form (BSF) to formally describe Pauli strings and reformulates IR synthesis as reducing the column weights of BSF by appropriate Clifford transformations. It comes with a heuristic BSF simplification algorithm that searches for the most appropriate 2Q Clifford operators in sequence to maximally simplify the BSF at each step, until the BSF can be directly synthesized by basic 1Q and 2Q gates. PHOENIX further performs a global ordering strategy in a Tetris-like fashion for these simplified IR groups, carefully balancing optimization opportunities for gate cancellation, minimizing circuit depth, and managing qubit routing overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that PHOENIX outperforms SOTA VQA compilers across diverse program categories, backend ISAs, and hardware topologies.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03529v3
"DeepCircuitX: A Comprehensive Repository-Level Dataset for RTL Code   Understanding, Generation, and PPA Analysis","This paper introduces DeepCircuitX, a comprehensive repository-level dataset designed to advance RTL (Register Transfer Level) code understanding, generation, and power-performance-area (PPA) analysis. Unlike existing datasets that are limited to either file-level RTL code or physical layout data, DeepCircuitX provides a holistic, multilevel resource that spans repository, file, module, and block-level RTL code. This structure enables more nuanced training and evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for RTL-specific tasks. DeepCircuitX is enriched with Chain of Thought (CoT) annotations, offering detailed descriptions of functionality and structure at multiple levels. These annotations enhance its utility for a wide range of tasks, including RTL code understanding, generation, and completion. Additionally, the dataset includes synthesized netlists and PPA metrics, facilitating early-stage design exploration and enabling accurate PPA prediction directly from RTL code. We demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness on various LLMs finetuned with our dataset and confirm the quality with human evaluations. Our results highlight DeepCircuitX as a critical resource for advancing RTL-focused machine learning applications in hardware design automation.Our data is available at https://zeju.gitbook.io/lcm-team.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18297v1
"CRDT Emulation, Simulation, and Representation Independence","Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) are distributed data structures designed for fault tolerance and high availability. CRDTs can be taxonomized into state-based CRDTs, in which replicas apply updates locally and periodically broadcast their local state to other replicas, and operation-based (op-based) CRDTs, in which every state-updating operation is individually broadcast and applied at each replica. In the literature, state-based and op-based CRDTs are considered equivalent due to the existence of algorithms that transform one kind of CRDT into the other. In particular, verification techniques and results for one kind of CRDT are often said to be applicable to the other kind, thanks to this equivalence. However, what it means for state-based and op-based CRDTs to emulate each other has never been made fully precise. In particular, emulation is nontrivial since state-based and op-based CRDTs place different requirements on the behavior of the underlying network with regard to both the causal ordering of message delivery, and the granularity of the messages themselves.   In this paper, we specify and formalize CRDT emulation in terms of simulation by modeling CRDTs and their interactions with the network as formal transition systems. We show that emulation can be understood as weak simulations between the transition systems of the original and emulating CRDT systems, thus closing a gap in the CRDT literature. We precisely characterize which properties of CRDT systems are preserved by our weak simulations, and therefore which properties can be said to be applicable to state-based CRDTs as long as they are applicable to op-based CRDTs and vice versa. Finally, we leverage our emulation results to obtain a general representation independence result for CRDTs: intuitively, clients of a CRDT cannot tell whether they are interacting with a state-based or op-based CRDT in particular.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05398v1
An Empirical Study on the Performance and Energy Usage of Compiled   Python Code,"Python is a popular programming language known for its ease of learning and extensive libraries. However, concerns about performance and energy consumption have led to the development of compilers to enhance Python code efficiency. Despite the proven benefits of existing compilers on the efficiency of Python code, there is limited analysis comparing their performance and energy efficiency, particularly considering code characteristics and factors like CPU frequency and core count. Our study investigates how compilation impacts the performance and energy consumption of Python code, using seven benchmarks compiled with eight different tools: PyPy, Numba, Nuitka, Mypyc, Codon, Cython, Pyston-lite, and the experimental Python 3.13 version, compared to CPython. The benchmarks are single-threaded and executed on an NUC and a server, measuring energy usage, execution time, memory usage, and Last-Level Cache (LLC) miss rates at a fixed frequency and on a single core. The results show that compilation can significantly enhance execution time, energy and memory usage, with Codon, PyPy, and Numba achieving over 90\% speed and energy improvements. Nuitka optimizes memory usage consistently on both testbeds. The impact of compilation on LLC miss rate is not clear since it varies considerably across benchmarks for each compiler. Our study is important for researchers and practitioners focused on improving Python code performance and energy efficiency. We outline future research directions, such as exploring caching effects on energy usage. Our findings help practitioners choose the best compiler based on their efficiency benefits and accessibility.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02346v1
Efficient Timestamping for Sampling-based Race Detection,"Dynamic race detection based on the happens before (HB) partial order has now become the de facto approach to quickly identify data races in multi-threaded software. Most practical implementations for detecting these races use timestamps to infer causality between events and detect races based on these timestamps. Such an algorithm updates timestamps (stored in vector clocks) at every event in the execution, and is known to induce excessive overhead. Random sampling has emerged as a promising algorithmic paradigm to offset this overhead. It offers the promise of making sound race detection scalable. In this work we consider the task of designing an efficient sampling based race detector with low overhead for timestamping when the number of sampled events is much smaller than the total events in an execution. To solve this problem, we propose (1) a new notion of freshness timestamp, (2) a new data structure to store timestamps, and (3) an algorithm that uses a combination of them to reduce the cost of timestamping in sampling based race detection. Further, we prove that our algorithm is close to optimal -- the number of vector clock traversals is bounded by the number of sampled events and number of threads, and further, on any given dynamic execution, the cost of timestamping due to our algorithm is close to the amount of work any timestamping-based algorithm must perform on that execution, that is it is instance optimal. Our evaluation on real world benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm over prior timestamping algorithms that are agnostic to sampling.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06688v1
Quantifier Elimination and Craig Interpolation: The Quantitative Way   (Technical Report),"Quantifier elimination (QE) and Craig interpolation (CI) are central to various state-of-the-art automated approaches to hardware- and software verification. They are rooted in the Boolean setting and are successful for, e.g., first-order theories such as linear rational arithmetic. What about their applicability in the quantitative setting where formulae evaluate to numbers and quantitative supremum/infimum quantifiers are the natural pendant to traditional Boolean quantifiers? Applications include establishing quantitative properties of programs such as bounds on expected outcomes of probabilistic programs featuring unbounded non-determinism and analyzing the flow of information through programs.   In this paper, we present the - to the best of our knowledge - first QE algorithm for possibly unbounded, $\infty$- or $(-\infty)$-valued, or discontinuous piecewise linear quantities. They are the quantitative counterpart to linear rational arithmetic, and are a popular quantitative assertion language for probabilistic program verification. We provide rigorous soundness proofs as well as upper space complexity bounds. Moreover, our algorithm yields a quantitative CI theorem: Given arbitrary piecewise linear quantities $f,g$ with $f \models g$, both the strongest and the weakest Craig interpolant of $f$ and $g$ are quantifier-free and effectively constructible.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15156v1
IsaBIL: A Framework for Verifying (In)correctness of Binaries in   Isabelle/HOL (Extended Version),"This paper presents IsaBIL, a binary analysis framework in Isabelle/HOL that is based on the widely used Binary Analysis Platform (BAP). Specifically, in IsaBIL, we formalise BAP's intermediate language, called BIL and integrate it with Hoare logic (to enable proofs of correctness) as well as incorrectness logic (to enable proofs of incorrectness). IsaBIL inherits the full flexibility of BAP, allowing us to verify binaries for a wide range of languages (C, C++, Rust), toolchains (LLVM, Ghidra) and target architectures (x86, RISC-V), and can also be used when the source code for a binary is unavailable.   To make verification tractable, we develop a number of big-step rules that combine BIL's existing small-step rules at different levels of abstraction to support reuse. We develop high-level reasoning rules for RISC-V instructions (our main target architecture) to further optimise verification. Additionally, we develop Isabelle proof tactics that exploit common patterns in C binaries for RISC-V to discharge large numbers of proof goals (often in the 100s) automatically. IsaBIL includes an Isabelle/ML based parser for BIL programs, allowing one to automatically generate the associated Isabelle/HOL program locale from a BAP output. Taken together, IsaBIL provides a highly flexible proof environment for program binaries. As examples, we prove correctness of key examples from the Joint Strike Fighter coding standards and the MITRE database.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16775v1
An Empirical Study of Rust-Specific Bugs in the rustc Compiler,"Rust is gaining popularity for its well-known memory safety guarantees and high performance, distinguishing it from C/C++ and JVM-based languages. Its compiler, rustc, enforces these guarantees through specialized mechanisms such as trait solving, borrow checking, and specific optimizations. However, Rust's unique language mechanisms introduce complexity to its compiler, leading to Rust-specific compiler bugs that are less common in traditional compilers. With Rust's increasing adoption in safety-critical domains, understanding these language mechanisms and their impact on compiler bugs is essential for improving the reliability of both rustc and Rust programs. Yet, we still lack a large-scale, detailed, and in-depth study of Rust-specific bugs in rustc.   To bridge this gap, this work conducts a comprehensive and systematic study of Rust-specific bugs in rustc, with a particular focus on the components that support its unique language features. Our analysis examines issues and fixes reported between 2022 and 2024, with a manual review of 301 valid issues. We categorize these bugs based on their causes, symptoms, affected compilation stages, and test case characteristics. Additionally, we evaluate existing rustc testing tools to assess their effectiveness and limitations. Our key findings include: (1) rustc bugs primarily arise from Rust's type system and lifetime model, with frequent errors in the High-Level Intermediate Representation (HIR) and Mid-Level Intermediate Representation (MIR) modules due to complex checkers and optimizations; (2) bug-revealing test cases often involve unstable features, advanced trait usages, lifetime annotations, standard APIs, and specific optimization levels; (3) while both valid and invalid programs can trigger bugs, existing testing tools struggle to detect non-crash errors, underscoring the need for further advancements in rustc testing.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23985v1

"Functional Reactive Programming with Effects, A More Permissive Approach","We introduce a functional reactive programming language that extends WORMHOLES, an enhancement of YAMPA with support for effects. Our proposal relaxes the constraint in WORMHOLES that restricts all resources to single-use. Resources are categorized into two kinds: input/output resources and internal resources. Input/output resources model interactions with the environment and follow constraints similar to those in WORMHOLES. Internal resources, on the other hand, enable communication between program components and can be used multiple times. We demonstrate that programs written in our language can be translated into equivalent effect-free YAMPA programs, ensuring that our approach remains compatible with existing functional reactive paradigms.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06162v1
Understanding and Detecting Compatibility Issues in Android Auto Apps,"Mobile platforms now power not only smartphones but also in-vehicle systems like Android Auto and CarPlay. Despite an ecosystem of over 3.5 million Android apps and more than 200 million Android Auto-compatible vehicles, only a few hundred apps have been adapted for automotive use. To better understand this gap, we studied 147 reported issues related to Android Auto and identified their root causes. We found that more than 70% of issues result from UI incompatibilities, 24% from media playback errors, and around 5% from failures in voice command handling, showing a lack of effective tools for developers. We introduce CarCompat, a static analysis framework that detects compatibility problems in Android Auto apps. CarCompat constructs a Car-Control Flow Graph (CCFG) to capture interactions among app components, lifecycle methods, and platform-specific callbacks. It applies specialized checkers to detect UI violations, media playback errors, and issues with voice command handling. We evaluated CarCompat on a dataset of 54 Android Auto apps and detected 25 new issues, 4 of which were confirmed by developers, and 2 developers have already released their fixes. The results show that CarCompat helps developers identify and fix compatibility issues, improving the in-vehicle experience.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04003v1
Fail Faster: Staging and Fast Randomness for High-Performance PBT,"Property-based testing (PBT) relies on generators for random test cases, often constructed using embedded domain specific languages, which provide expressive combinators for building and composing generators. The effectiveness of PBT depends critically on the speed of these generators. However, careful measurements show that the generator performance of widely used PBT libraries falls well short of what is possible, due principally to (1) the abstraction overhead of their combinator-heavy style and (2) suboptimal sources of randomness. We characterize, quantify, and address these bottlenecks.   To eliminate abstraction overheads, we propose a technique based on multi-stage programming, dubbed Allegro. We apply this technique to leading generator libraries in OCaml and Scala 3, significantly improving performance. To quantify the performance impact of the randomness source, we carry out a controlled experiment, replacing the randomness in the OCaml PBT library with an optimized version. Both interventions exactly preserve the semantics of generators, enabling precise, pointwise comparisons. Together, these improvements find bugs up to $13\times$ faster.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19797v1
ProofWala: Multilingual Proof Data Synthesis and Theorem-Proving,"Neural networks have shown substantial promise at automatic theorem-proving in interactive proof assistants (ITPs) like Lean and Coq. However, most neural theorem-proving models are restricted to specific ITPs, leaving out opportunities for cross-lingual $\textit{transfer}$ between ITPs. We address this weakness with a multilingual proof framework, ${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$, that allows a standardized form of interaction between neural theorem-provers and two established ITPs (Coq and Lean). It enables the collection of multilingual proof step data -- data recording the result of proof actions on ITP states -- for training neural provers. ${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$ allows the systematic evaluation of a model's performance across different ITPs and problem domains via efficient parallel proof search algorithms. We show that multilingual training enabled by ${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$ can lead to successful transfer across ITPs. Specifically, a model trained on a mix of ${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$-generated Coq and Lean data outperforms Lean-only and Coq-only models on the standard prove-at-$k$ metric. We open source all code including code for the ${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$ Framework (https://github.com/trishullab/proof-wala), and the Multilingual ITP interaction framework (https://github.com/trishullab/itp-interface).",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04671v2
Evolution Language Framework for Persistent Objects,"Context: Multi-schema-version data management (MSVDM) is the database technology that simultaneously supports multiple schema versions of one database. With the technology, multiple versions of one software system can co-exist and exchange data even when the system's data structure evolves along with versions.   Inquiry: While there have been developed MSVDM theories and implementations for relational databases, they are not directly applicable to persistent objects. Since persistent objects are commonly implemented by means of object-relational mapping (OR-mapping), we need a right level of abstraction in order to describe evolution of data structures and translate data accesses in between different versions.   Approach: We propose a new evolution language consisting of a set of evolution operations, each denoting a modification of the source code and implicitly defining the corresponding modification to the database schema. Given the existence of multiple mapping mechanisms from persistent objects to databases, we designed the evolution language at two levels. At the abstract level, it handles scenarios such as refactoring and adding classes and fields. At the concrete level, we provide definitions for different mapping mechanisms separately, leveraging the existing database evolution language that supports MSVDM.   Knowledge: Our evolution language is designed to support existing evolution operations proposed in prior work. Additionally, it introduces support for operations related to class hierarchy changes, which are not covered by previous approaches. Using our proposal, two concrete mapping mechanisms, namely, a JPA-like mapping and signal classes, can be provided separately. Furthermore, our evolution language preserves program behavior and covers common evolution operations in practice.   Grounding: This work is supported by the formal definition of both the target abstract core language and the proposed evolution language, the formulation of several theorems demonstrating the soundness of our proposals, and the proofs of these theorems. Additionally, an empirical study was conducted to investigate the evolution histories of three open-source projects.   Importance: To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first evolution language for persistent objects that supports MSVDM. Moreover, it is the first evolution language defined at an abstract level. By defining mappings separately, we can apply it to a wide range of persistent object mechanisms built on top of SQL.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20530v1

DeCon: Detecting Incorrect Assertions via Postconditions Generated by a   Large Language Model,"Recently, given the docstring for the target problem and the target function signature, large language models (LLMs) have been used not only to generate source code, but also to generate test cases, consisting of test inputs and assertions (e.g., in the form of checking an actual output against the expected output). However, as shown by our empirical study on assertions generated by four LLMs for the HumanEval benchmark, over 62% of the generated assertions are incorrect (i.e., failed on the ground-truth problem solution). To detect incorrect assertions (given the docstring and the target function signature along with a sample of example inputs and outputs), in this paper, we propose a new approach named DeCon to effectively detect incorrect assertions via LLM-generated postconditions for the target problem (a postcondition is a predicate that must always be true just after the execution of the ground-truth problem solution). Our approach requires a small set of I/O examples (i.e., a sample of example inputs and outputs) for the target problem (e.g., the I/O examples included in the docstring for a target problem in HumanEval). We use the given I/O examples to filter out those LLM-generated postconditions that are violated by at least one given I/O example. We then use the remaining postconditions to detect incorrect assertions as those assertions that violate at least one remaining postcondition. Experimental results show that DeCon can detect averagely more than 64% (63% and 65.5% detected by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, respectively) incorrect assertions generated by four state-of-the-art LLMs, and DeCon can also improve the effectiveness of these LLMs in code generation by 4% in terms of Pass@1. In addition, although DeCon might filter out correct assertions, the fault-finding ability of the remaining correct assertions decreases only slightly.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02901v1
Certus: A domain specific language for confidence assessment in   assurance cases,"Assurance cases (ACs) are prepared to argue that a system has satisfied critical quality attributes. Many methods exist to assess confidence in ACs, including quantitative methods that represent confidence numerically. While quantitative methods are attractive in principle, existing methods suffer from issues related to interpretation, subjectivity, scalability, dialectic reasoning, and trustworthiness, which have limited their adoption. This paper introduces Certus, a domain specific language for quantitative confidence assessment. In Certus, users describe their confidence with fuzzy sets, which allow them to represent their judgment using vague, but linguistically meaningful terminology. Certus includes syntax to specify confidence propagation using expressions that can be easily inspected by users.

Pearce's Characterisation in an Epistemic Domain,"Answer-set programming (ASP) is a successful problem-solving approach in logic-based AI. In ASP, problems are represented as declarative logic programs, and solutions are identified through their answer sets. Equilibrium logic (EL) is a general-purpose nonmonotonic reasoning formalism, based on a monotonic logic called here-and-there logic. EL was basically proposed by Pearce as a foundational framework of ASP. Epistemic specifications (ES) are extensions of ASP-programs with subjective literals. These new modal constructs in the ASP-language make it possible to check whether a regular literal of ASP is true in every (or some) answer-set of a program. ES-programs are interpreted by world-views, which are essentially collections of answer-sets. (Reflexive) autoepistemic logic is a nonmonotonic formalism, modeling self-belief (knowledge) of ideally rational agents. A relatively new semantics for ES is based on a combination of EL and (reflexive) autoepistemic logic. In this paper, we first propose an overarching framework in the epistemic ASP domain. We then establish a correspondence between existing (reflexive) (auto)epistemic equilibrium logics and our easily-adaptable comprehensive framework, building on Pearce's characterisation of answer-sets as equilibrium models. We achieve this by extending Ferraris' work on answer sets for propositional theories to the epistemic case and reveal the relationship between some ES-semantic proposals.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09221v1
Language-Parametric Reference Synthesis (Extended),"Modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) offer automated refactorings to aid programmers in developing and maintaining software. However, implementing sound automated refactorings is challenging, as refactorings may inadvertently introduce name-binding errors or cause references to resolve to incorrect declarations. To address these issues, previous work by Sch\""afer et al. proposed replacing concrete references with locked references to separate binding preservation from transformation. Locked references vacuously resolve to a specific declaration, and after transformation must be replaced with concrete references that also resolve to that declaration. Synthesizing these references requires a faithful inverse of the name lookup functions of the underlying language.   Manually implementing such inverse lookup functions is challenging due to the complex name-binding features in modern programming languages. Instead, we propose to automatically derive this function from type system specifications written in the Statix meta-DSL. To guide the synthesis of qualified references we use scope graphs, which represent the binding structure of a program, to infer their names and discover their syntactic structure.   We evaluate our approach by synthesizing concrete references for locked references in 2528 Java, 196 ChocoPy, and 49 Featherweight Generic Java test programs. Our approach yields a principled language-parametric method for synthesizing references.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19143v1
Learning Randomized Reductions and Program Properties,"The correctness of computations remains a significant challenge in computer science, with traditional approaches relying on automated testing or formal verification. Self-testing/correcting programs introduce an alternative paradigm, allowing a program to verify and correct its own outputs via randomized reductions, a concept that previously required manual derivation. In this paper, we present Bitween, a method and tool for automated learning of randomized (self)-reductions and program properties in numerical programs. Bitween combines symbolic analysis and machine learning, with a surprising finding: polynomial-time linear regression, a basic optimization method, is not only sufficient but also highly effective for deriving complex randomized self-reductions and program invariants, often outperforming sophisticated mixed-integer linear programming solvers. We establish a theoretical framework for learning these reductions and introduce RSR-Bench, a benchmark suite for evaluating Bitween's capabilities on scientific and machine learning functions. Our empirical results show that Bitween surpasses state-of-the-art tools in scalability, stability, and sample efficiency when evaluated on nonlinear invariant benchmarks like NLA-DigBench. Bitween is open-source as a Python package and accessible via a web interface that supports C language programs.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18134v1
Building Bridges: Julia as an MLIR Frontend,"Driven by increasing compute requirements for deep learning models, compiler developers have been looking for ways to target specialised hardware and heterogeneous systems more efficiently. The MLIR project has the goal to offer infrastructure that can be used to develop new compilers and represent code at different levels of abstractions. While MLIR excels at offering developers a way to write new IR and transformations, there is no easy way for end users to generate code in these IR. In this work, we explore using the Julia programming language as a high-level input language for generating MLIR code. Most importantly, we focus on extensibility, allowing package developers to implement bindings to MLIR dialects in an intuitive and easy-to-use manner. By building on the Julia programming language, and its expressive features such as multiple dispatch and its extensible compiler, we design and implement a framework to generate MLIR code. Additionally, we evaluate this framework in three case studies. Ranging from developing a small DSL for einsum expressions, to specifying transformations on MLIR code and programming kernels to be run on GPU.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04771v1
Green AI: Which Programming Language Consumes the Most?,"AI is demanding an evergrowing portion of environmental resources. Despite their potential impact on AI environmental sustainability, the role that programming languages play in AI (in)efficiency is to date still unknown. With this study, we aim to understand the impact that programming languages can have on AI environmental sustainability. To achieve our goal, we conduct a controlled empirical experiment by considering five programming languages (C++, Java, Python, MATLAB, and R), seven AI algorithms (KNN, SVC, AdaBoost, decision tree, logistic regression, naive bayses, and random forest), three popular datasets, and the training and inference phases. The collected results show that programming languages have a considerable impact on AI environmental sustainability. Compiled and semi-compiled languages (C++, Java) consistently consume less than interpreted languages (Python, MATLAB, R), which require up to 54x more energy. Some languages are cumulatively more efficient in training, while others in inference. Which programming language consumes the most highly depends on the algorithm considered. Ultimately, algorithm implementation might be the most determining factor in Green AI, regardless of the language used. As conclusion, while making AI more environmentally sustainable is paramount, a trade-off between energy efficiency and implementation ease should always be considered. Green AI can be achieved without the need of completely disrupting the development practices and technologies currently in place.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14776v1
"Multiparty Session Typing, Embedded (Technical Report)","Multiparty session typing (MPST) is a method to make concurrent programming simpler. The idea is to use type checking to automatically detect safety and liveness violations of implementations relative to specifications. In practice, the premier approach to combine MPST with mainstream languages -- in the absence of native support -- is based on external DSLs and associated tooling.   In contrast, we study the question of how to support MPST by using internal DSLs. Answering this question positively, this paper presents the mpst.embedded library: it leverages Scala's lightweight form of dependent typing, called match types, to embed MPST directly into Scala. Our internal-DSL-based approach avoids programming friction and leaky abstractions of the external-DSL-based approach for MPST.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17741v1
Data Spatial Programming,"We introduce a novel programming model, Data Spatial Programming, which extends the semantics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by introducing new class-like constructs called archetypes. These archetypes encapsulate the topological relationships between data entities and the execution flow in a structured manner, enabling more expressive and semantically rich computations over interconnected data structures or finite states. By formalizing the relationships between data elements in this topological space, our approach allows for more intuitive modeling of complex systems where a topology of connections is formed for the underlying computational model. This paradigm addresses limitations in traditional OOP when representing a wide range of problems in computer science such as agent-based systems, social networks, processing on relational data, neural networks, distributed systems, finite state machines, and other spatially-oriented computational problems.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15812v5
Mimosa: A Language for Asynchronous Implementation of Embedded Systems   Software,"This paper introduces the Mimosa language, a programming language for the design and implementation of asynchronous reactive systems, describing them as a collection of time-triggered processes which communicate through FIFO buffers. Syntactically, Mimosa builds upon the Lustre data-flow language, augmenting it with a new semantics to allow for the expression of side-effectful computations, and extending it with an asynchronous coordination layer which orchestrates the communication between processes. A formal semantics is given to both the process and coordination layer through a textual and graphical rewriting calculus, respectively, and a prototype interpreter for simulation is provided.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02557v1
LLM-Guided Compositional Program Synthesis,"Program synthesis from input-output examples, also called programming by example (PBE), has had tremendous impact on automating end-user tasks. Large language models (LLMs) have the ability to solve PBE tasks by generating code in different target languages, but they can fail unpredictably. To recover for failure, most approaches, such as self-reflection, use the LLM to solve the same task, but with a richer context. We introduce a novel technique that recovers from failure by constructing simpler subtasks for the LLM to solve. Our approach performs compositional program synthesis using LLMs, where LLM not only guides the decomposition of the PBE task into subtasks, but also solves the subtasks. We present different strategies for decomposing the original task. We experimentally show that our approach can solve challenging task instances that are not solved by self-reflection alone.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15540v1
Towards Provable Security in Industrial Control Systems Via Dynamic   Protocol Attestation,"Industrial control systems (ICSs) increasingly rely on digital technologies vulnerable to cyber attacks. Cyber attackers can infiltrate ICSs and execute malicious actions. Individually, each action seems innocuous. But taken together, they cause the system to enter an unsafe state. These attacks have resulted in dramatic consequences such as physical damage, economic loss, and environmental catastrophes. This paper introduces a methodology that restricts actions using protocols. These protocols only allow safe actions to execute. Protocols are written in a domain specific language we have embedded in an interactive theorem prover (ITP). The ITP enables formal, machine-checked proofs to ensure protocols maintain safety properties. We use dynamic attestation to ensure ICSs conform to their protocol even if an adversary compromises a component. Since protocol conformance prevents unsafe actions, the previously mentioned cyber attacks become impossible. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology using an example from the Fischertechnik Industry 4.0 platform. We measure dynamic attestation's impact on latency and throughput. Our approach is a starting point for studying how to combine formal methods and protocol design to thwart attacks intended to cripple ICSs.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14467v1
Linearization via Rewriting (Long Version),"We introduce the structural resource lambda-calculus, a new formalism in which strongly normalizing terms of the lambda-calculus can naturally be represented, and at the same time any type derivation can be internally rewritten to its linearization. The calculus is shown to be normalizing and confluent. Noticeably, every strongly normalizable lambda-term can be represented by a type derivation. This is the first example of a system where the linearization process takes place internally, while remaining purely finitary and rewrite-based.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04408v2
Refuting Equivalence in Probabilistic Programs with Conditioning,"We consider the problem of refuting equivalence of probabilistic programs, i.e., the problem of proving that two probabilistic programs induce different output distributions. We study this problem in the context of programs with conditioning (i.e., with observe and score statements), where the output distribution is conditioned by the event that all the observe statements along a run evaluate to true, and where the probability densities of different runs may be updated via the score statements. Building on a recent work on programs without conditioning, we present a new equivalence refutation method for programs with conditioning. Our method is based on weighted restarting, a novel transformation of probabilistic programs with conditioning to the output equivalent probabilistic programs without conditioning that we introduce in this work. Our method is the first to be both a) fully automated, and b) providing provably correct answers. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on a set of programs from the probabilistic inference literature.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06579v1
Fully Automated Generation of Combinatorial Optimisation Systems Using   Large Language Models,"Over the last few decades, researchers have made considerable efforts to make decision support more accessible for small and medium enterprises by reducing the cost of designing, developing and maintaining automated decision support systems. However, due to the diversity of the underlying combinatorial optimisation problems, reusability of such systems has been limited; in most cases, expensive expertise has been required to implement bespoke software components.   We explore the feasibility of fully automated generation of combinatorial optimisation systems using large language models (LLMs). An LLM will be responsible for interpreting the user-provided problem description in natural language and designing and implementing problem-specific software components. We discuss the principles of fully automated LLM-based optimisation system generation, and evaluate several proof-of-concept generators, comparing their performance on four optimisation problems.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15556v2
Adaptive Shielding via Parametric Safety Proofs,"A major challenge to deploying cyber-physical systems with learning-enabled controllers is to ensure their safety, especially in the face of changing environments that necessitate runtime knowledge acquisition. Model-checking and automated reasoning have been successfully used for shielding, i.e., to monitor untrusted controllers and override potentially unsafe decisions, but only at the cost of hard tradeoffs in terms of expressivity, safety, adaptivity, precision and runtime efficiency. We propose a programming-language framework that allows experts to statically specify adaptive shields for learning-enabled agents, which enforce a safe control envelope that gets more permissive as knowledge is gathered at runtime. A shield specification provides a safety model that is parametric in the current agent's knowledge. In addition, a nondeterministic inference strategy can be specified using a dedicated domain-specific language, enforcing that such knowledge parameters are inferred at runtime in a statistically-sound way. By leveraging language design and theorem proving, our proposed framework empowers experts to design adaptive shields with an unprecedented level of modeling flexibility, while providing rigorous, end-to-end probabilistic safety guarantees.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18879v1
Automated Verification of Soundness of DNN Certifiers,"The uninterpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) hinders their use in safety-critical applications. Abstract Interpretation-based DNN certifiers provide promising avenues for building trust in DNNs. Unsoundness in the mathematical logic of these certifiers can lead to incorrect results. However, current approaches to ensure their soundness rely on manual, expert-driven proofs that are tedious to develop, limiting the speed of developing new certifiers. Automating the verification process is challenging due to the complexity of verifying certifiers for arbitrary DNN architectures and handling diverse abstract analyses.   We introduce ProveSound, a novel verification procedure that automates the soundness verification of DNN certifiers for arbitrary DNN architectures. Our core contribution is the novel concept of a symbolic DNN, using which, ProveSound reduces the soundness property, a universal quantification over arbitrary DNNs, to a tractable symbolic representation, enabling verification with standard SMT solvers. By formalizing the syntax and operational semantics of ConstraintFlow, a DSL for specifying certifiers, ProveSound efficiently verifies both existing and new certifiers, handling arbitrary DNN architectures.

FSLH: Flexible Mechanized Speculative Load Hardening,"The Spectre speculative side-channel attacks pose formidable threats for security. Research has shown that code following the cryptographic constant-time discipline can be efficiently protected against Spectre v1 using a selective variant of Speculative Load Hardening (SLH). SLH was, however, not strong enough for protecting non-cryptographic code, leading to the introduction of Ultimate SLH, which provides protection for arbitrary programs, but has too large overhead for general use, since it conservatively assumes that all data is secret. In this paper we introduce a flexible SLH notion that achieves the best of both worlds by generalizing both Selective and Ultimate SLH. We give a suitable security definition for such transformations protecting arbitrary programs: any transformed program running with speculation should not leak more than what the source program leaks sequentially. We formally prove using the Rocq prover that two flexible SLH variants enforce this relative security guarantee. As easy corollaries we also obtain that, in our setting, Ultimate SLH enforces our relative security notion, and two selective SLH variants enforce speculative constant-time security.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03203v5
A Lightweight Method for Generating Multi-Tier JIT Compilation Virtual   Machine in a Meta-Tracing Compiler Framework,"Meta-compiler frameworks, such as RPython and Graal/Truffle, generate high-performance virtual machines (VMs) from interpreter definitions. Although they generate VMs with high-quality just-in-time (JIT) compilers, they still lack an important feature that dedicated VMs (i.e., VMs that are developed for specific languages) have, namely \emph{multi-tier compilation}. Multi-tier compilation uses light-weight compilers at early stages and highly-optimizing compilers at later stages in order to balance between compilation overheads and code quality.   We propose a novel approach to enabling multi-tier compilation in the VMs generated by a meta-compiler framework. Instead of extending the JIT compiler backend of the framework, our approach drives an existing (heavyweight) compiler backend in the framework to quickly generate unoptimized native code by merely embedding directives and compile-time operations into interpreter definitions.   As a validation of the approach, we developed 2SOM, a Simple Object Machine with a two-tier JIT compiler based on RPython. 2SOM first applies the tier-1 threaded code generator that is generated by our proposed technique, then, to the loops that exceed a threshold, applies the tier-2 tracing JIT compiler that is generated by the original RPython framework. Our performance evaluation that runs a program with a realistic workload showed that 2SOM improved, when compared against an RPython-based VM, warm-up performance by 15\%, with merely a 5\% reduction in peak performance.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17460v2
Quantifying the Importance of Data Alignment in Downstream Model   Performance,"Contrary to the conventional emphasis on dataset size, we explore the role of data alignment -- an often overlooked aspect of data quality -- in training capable Large Language Models (LLMs). To do so, we use the Task2Vec-based alignment coefficient, a quantitative measure of the similarity between two datasets, to quantify the impact of alignment between training data and evaluation data on downstream performance. In particular, we conduct controlled \textit{interventional} experiments for two settings: 1. the impact of increased alignment coefficients between various pre-training (pt) against evaluation datasets, and 2. the impact of increased alignment coefficients between domain specific fine-tuning (ft) against domain specific evaluation. The domain specific task we explore is Autoformalization -- the machine translation task between natural language and code for formal verification. In both settings, we find a strong, predictable negative correlation between the alignment coefficient of a model's training and evaluation data and the model's loss/perplexity on the respective downstream task. These findings suggest a re-evaluation of LLM training approaches, demonstrating the relevance of data alignment compared to data quantity, especially in specialized downstream tasks such as Autoformalization.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08496v2
Practical Type-Based Taint Checking and Inference (Extended Version),"Many important security properties can be formulated in terms of flows of tainted data, and improved taint analysis tools to prevent such flows are of critical need. Most existing taint analyses use whole-program static analysis, leading to scalability challenges. Type-based checking is a promising alternative, as it enables modular and incremental checking for fast performance. However, type-based approaches have not been widely adopted in practice, due to challenges with false positives and annotating existing codebases. In this paper, we present a new approach to type-based checking of taint properties that addresses these challenges, based on two key techniques. First, we present a new type-based tainting checker with significantly reduced false positives, via more practical handling of third-party libraries and other language constructs. Second, we present a novel technique to automatically infer tainting type qualifiers for existing code. Our technique supports inference of generic type argument annotations, crucial for tainting properties. We implemented our techniques in a tool TaintTyper and evaluated it on real-world benchmarks. TaintTyper exceeds the recall of a state-of-the-art whole-program taint analyzer, with comparable precision, and 2.93X-22.9X faster checking time. Further, TaintTyper infers annotations comparable to those written by hand, suitable for insertion into source code. TaintTyper is a promising new approach to efficient and practical taint checking.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18529v2
Conversational Concurrency with Dataspaces and Facets,"Context: Developers have come to appreciate the simplicity of message-passing actors for concurrent programming tasks. The actor model of computation is easy to grasp; it is just a conversation among actors with a common goal. Importantly, it eliminates some basic pitfalls of the dominant shared-memory model, most critically data races.   Inquiry: A close look at real-world conversations suggests, however, that they are not mere exchanges of messages. Participants must keep in mind conversational context, and participants joining late can and often must acquire some of this context. In addition, some settings call for engaging in several conversations in parallel; in others, participants conduct temporarily limited sub-conversations to clarify a point. Existing actor code exhibits complex design patterns that get around the underlying limitations of the pure message-passing model.   Approach: These patterns suggest a number of elements involved in programming conversational computations. Translated into terms of language design, they call for two kinds of facilities: (1) one for sharing conversational context and (2) another one for organizing individual actors around on-going conversations and their contexts.   Knowledge: This paper presents Syndicate, a language designed to directly support the programming of conversing actors. Beyond message passing, it supplies (1) a dataspace, which allows actors to make public assertions, to withdraw them, and to query what other actors have asserted; and (2) the facet notation, which enables programmers to express individual actors as a reflection of the on-going conversations.   Grounding: A worked example introduces these concepts and illustrates conversational programming in Syndicate. A comparison with other research and industrial concurrent languages demonstrates the unique support Syndicate provides.   Importance: Syndicate advances concurrent actor programming with enhancements that address some observed limitations of the underlying model. While message-passing simplifies concurrent programming, it falls short in handling the complexities of actual computational conversations. By introducing a dataspace actor for sharing conversational context and the facet notation for organizing actors around ongoing conversations, Syndicate enables developers to naturally express and manage the nuanced interactions often required in concurrent systems. These innovations reduce the need for complex design patterns and provide unique support for building robust, context-aware concurrent applications.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20542v1
DeepLL: Considering Linear Logic for the Analysis of Deep Learning   Experiments,"Deep Learning experiments have critical requirements regarding the careful handling of their datasets as well as the efficient and correct usage of APIs that interact with hardware accelerators. On the one hand, software mistakes during data handling can contaminate experiments and lead to incorrect results. On the other hand, poorly coded APIs that interact with the hardware can lead to sub-optimal usage and untrustworthy conclusions. In this work we investigate the use of Linear Logic for the analysis of Deep Learning experiments. We show that primitives and operators of Linear Logic can be used to express: (i) an abstract representation of the control flow of an experiment, (ii) a set of available experimental resources, such as API calls to the underlying data-structures and hardware as well as (iii) reasoning rules about the correct consumption of resources during experiments. Our proposed model is not only lightweight but also easy to comprehend having both a symbolic and a visual component. Finally, its artifacts are themselves proofs in Linear Logic that can be readily verified by off-the-shelf reasoners.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00169v1
Linear-Time Graph Programs without Preconditions,"We report on a recent breakthrough in rule-based graph programming, which allows us to reach the time complexity of imperative linear-time algorithms. In general, achieving the complexity of graph algorithms in conventional languages using graph transformation rules is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be executed in linear time using the graph programming language GP 2. However, for non-destructive algorithms that retain the structure of input graphs, achieving linear runtime required input graphs to be connected and of bounded node degree. In this paper, we overcome these preconditions by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies, a cycle detection program, a program for numbering the connected components of a graph, and a breadth-first search program. Each of these programs runs in linear time on both connected and disconnected input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. We give empirical evidence for the linear time complexity by using timings for various classes of input graphs.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20465v1
Rulebook: bringing co-routines to reinforcement learning environments,"Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, due to their reliance on external systems to learn from, require digital environments (e.g., simulators) with very simple interfaces, which in turn constrain significantly the implementation of such environments. In particular, these environments are implemented either as separate processes or as state machines, leading to synchronization and communication overheads in the first case, and to unstructured programming in the second.   We propose a new domain-specific, co-routine-based, compiled language, called Rulebook, designed to automatically generate the state machine required to interact with machine learning (ML) algorithms and similar applications, with no performance overhead. Rulebook allows users to express programs without needing to be aware of the specific interface required by the ML components. By decoupling the execution model of the program from the syntactical encoding of the program, and thus without the need for manual state management, Rulebook allows to create larger and more sophisticated environments at a lower development cost.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19625v1
Lean-ing on Quality: How High-Quality Data Beats Diverse Multilingual   Data in AutoFormalization,"Autoformalization, the process of transforming informal mathematical language into formal specifications and proofs remains a difficult task for state-of-the-art (large) language models. Existing works point to competing explanations for the performance gap. To this end, we introduce a novel methodology that leverages back-translation with hand-curated prompts to enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models, particularly addressing the challenge posed by the scarcity of labeled data. Specifically, we evaluate three primary variations of this strategy: (1) on-the-fly (online) backtranslation, (2) distilled (offline) backtranslation with few-shot amplification, and (3) line-by-line proof analysis integrated with proof state information. Each variant is designed to optimize data quality over quantity, focusing on the high fidelity of generated proofs rather than sheer data scale. Our findings provide evidence that employing our proposed approaches to generate synthetic data, which prioritizes quality over volume, improves the Autoformalization performance of LLMs as measured by standard benchmarks such as ProofNet. Crucially, our approach outperforms pretrained models using a minimal number of tokens. We also show, through strategic prompting and backtranslation, that our approaches surpass the performance of fine-tuning with extensive multilingual datasets such as MMA on ProofNet with only 1/150th of the tokens. Taken together, our methods show a promising new approach to significantly reduce the resources required to formalize proofs, thereby accelerating AI for math.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15795v1
Building A Proof-Oriented Programmer That Is 64% Better Than GPT-4o   Under Data Scarcity,"Existing LMs struggle with proof-oriented programming due to data scarcity, which manifest in two key ways: (1) a lack of sufficient corpora for proof-oriented programming languages such as F*, and (2) the absence of large-scale, project-level proof-oriented implementations that can teach the model the intricate reasoning process when performing proof-oriented programming. We present the first on synthetic data augmentation for project level proof oriented programming for both generation and repair. Our method addresses data scarcity by synthesizing basic proof-oriented programming problems for proficiency in that language; incorporating diverse coding data for reasoning capability elicitation and creating new proofs and repair data within existing repositories. This approach enables language models to both synthesize and repair proofs for function- and repository-level code. We show that our fine-tuned 14B parameter model, PoPilot, can exceed the performance of the models that outperforms GPT-4o in project-level proof-oriented programming by 64% relative margin, and can improve GPT-4o's performance by 54% by repairing its outputs over GPT-4o's self-repair.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11901v2
Comparing semantic frameworks for dependently-sorted algebraic theories,"Algebraic theories with dependency between sorts form the structural core of Martin-L\""of type theory and similar systems. Their denotational semantics are typically studied using categorical techniques; many different categorical structures have been introduced to model them (contextual categories, categories with families, display map categories, etc.) Comparisons of these models are scattered throughout the literature, and a detailed, big-picture analysis of their relationships has been lacking.   We aim to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the relationships between as many such models as possible. Specifically, we take *comprehension categories* as a unifying language and show how almost all established notions of model embed as sub-2-categories (usually full) of the 2-category of comprehension categories.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19946v1
CodeIF-Bench: Evaluating Instruction-Following Capabilities of Large   Language Models in Interactive Code Generation,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in code generation tasks and have become indispensable programming assistants for developers. However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily assess the functional correctness of code generated by LLMs in single-turn interactions, offering limited insight into their capabilities to generate code that strictly follows users' instructions, especially in multi-turn interaction scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in interactive code generation. Specifically, CodeIF-Bench incorporates nine types of verifiable instructions aligned with the real-world software development requirements, which can be independently and objectively validated through specified test cases, facilitating the evaluation of instruction-following capability in multi-turn interactions. We evaluate nine prominent LLMs using CodeIF-Bench, and the experimental results reveal a significant disparity between their basic programming capability and instruction-following capability, particularly as task complexity, context length, and the number of dialogue rounds increase.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22688v2
A Proof-Producing Compiler for Blockchain Applications,"CairoZero is a programming language for running decentralized applications (dApps) at scale.

We demonstrate the success of our approach by verifying primitives for computation with the secp256k1 and secp256r1 curves over a large finite field as well as the validation of cryptographic signatures using the former. We also verify a mechanism for simulating a read-write dictionary data structure in a read-only setting.

Syzygy: Dual Code-Test C to (safe) Rust Translation using LLMs and   Dynamic Analysis,"Despite extensive usage in high-performance, low-level systems programming applications, C is susceptible to vulnerabilities due to manual memory management and unsafe pointer operations. Rust, a modern systems programming language, offers a compelling alternative. Its unique ownership model and type system ensure memory safety without sacrificing performance.   In this paper, we present Syzygy, an automated approach to translate C to safe Rust. Our technique uses a synergistic combination of LLM-driven code and test translation guided by dynamic-analysis-generated execution information. This paired translation runs incrementally in a loop over the program in dependency order of the code elements while maintaining per-step correctness. Our approach exposes novel insights on combining the strengths of LLMs and dynamic analysis in the context of scaling and combining code generation with testing. We apply our approach to successfully translate Zopfli, a high-performance compression library with ~3000 lines of code and 98 functions. We validate the translation by testing equivalence with the source C program on a set of inputs. To our knowledge, this is the largest automated and test-validated C to safe Rust code translation achieved so far.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14234v2
Safe Automated Refactoring for Efficient Migration of Imperative Deep   Learning Programs to Graph Execution,"Efficiency is essential to support responsiveness w.r.t. ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the ""best of both worlds,"" using them effectively requires subtle considerations to make code amenable to safe, accurate, and efficient graph execution. We present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in specifying whether their otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL code could be reliably and efficiently executed as graphs while preserving semantics. The approach, based on a novel imperative tensor analysis, automatically determines when it is safe and potentially advantageous to migrate imperative DL code to graph execution. The approach is implemented as a PyDev Eclipse IDE plug-in that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and evaluated on 19 Python projects consisting of 132.05 KLOC. We found that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v1
Corecursive Coding of High Computational Derivatives and Power Series,"We discuss the functional lazy techniques in generation and handling of arbitrarily long sequences of derivatives of numerical expressions in one ``variable''; the domain to which the paper belongs is usually nicknamed ``Automatic differentiation''. Two models thereof are considered, the chains of ``pure'' derivatives, and the infinite power series, similar, but algorithmically a bit different. We deal with their arithmetic/algebra, and with more convoluted procedures, such as composition and reversion. Some more specific applications of these structures are also presented.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13194v1
SecRef*: Securely Sharing Mutable References Between Verified and   Unverified Code in F*,"We introduce SecRef*, a secure compilation framework protecting stateful programs verified in F* against linked unverified code, with which the program dynamically shares ML-style mutable references. To ease program verification in this setting, we propose a way of tracking which references are shareable with the unverified code, and which ones are not shareable and whose contents are thus guaranteed to be unchanged after calling into unverified code. This universal property of non-shareable references is exposed in the interface on which the verified program can rely when calling into unverified code. The remaining refinement types and pre- and post-conditions that the verified code expects from the unverified code are converted into dynamic checks about the shared references by using higher-order contracts. We prove formally in F* that this strategy ensures sound and secure interoperability with unverified code. Since SecRef* is built on top of the Monotonic State effect of F*, these proofs rely on the first monadic representation for this effect, which is a contribution of our work that can be of independent interest. Finally, we use SecRef* to build a simple cooperative multi-threading scheduler that is verified and that securely interacts with unverified threads.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00404v1
Local Optimization of Quantum Circuits (Extended Version),"Recent advances in quantum architectures and computing have motivated the development of new optimizing compilers for quantum programs or circuits. Even though steady progress has been made, existing quantum optimization techniques remain asymptotically and practically inefficient and are unable to offer guarantees on the quality of the optimization. Because many global quantum circuit optimization problems belong to the complexity class QMA (the quantum analog of NP), it is not clear whether quality and efficiency guarantees can both be achieved.   In this paper, we present optimization techniques for quantum programs that can offer both efficiency and quality guarantees. Rather than requiring global optimality, our approach relies on a form of local optimality that requires each and every segment of the circuit to be optimal. We show that the local optimality notion can be attained by a cut-and-meld circuit optimization algorithm. The idea behind the algorithm is to cut a circuit into subcircuits, optimize each subcircuit independently by using a specified ""oracle"" optimizer, and meld the subcircuits by optimizing across the cuts lazily as needed. We specify the algorithm and prove that it ensures local optimality. To prove efficiency, we show that, under some assumptions, the main optimization phase of the algorithm requires a linear number of calls to the oracle optimizer. We implement and evaluate the local-optimality approach to circuit optimization and compare with the state-of-the-art optimizers. The empirical results show that our cut-and-meld algorithm can outperform existing optimizers significantly, by more than an order of magnitude on average, while also slightly improving optimization quality. These results show that local optimality can be a relatively strong optimization criterion and can be attained efficiently.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19526v1
Can LLMs Formally Reason as Abstract Interpreters for Program Analysis?,"LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code generation and comprehension, but their potential in being able to perform program analysis in a formal, automatic manner remains under-explored. To that end, we systematically investigate whether LLMs can reason about programs using a program analysis framework called abstract interpretation. We prompt LLMs to follow two different strategies, denoted as Compositional and Fixed Point Equation, to formally reason in the style of abstract interpretation, which has never been done before to the best of our knowledge. We validate our approach using state-of-the-art LLMs on 22 challenging benchmark programs from the Software Verification Competition (SV-COMP) 2019 dataset, widely used in program analysis. Our results show that our strategies are able to elicit abstract interpretation-based reasoning in the tested models, but LLMs are susceptible to logical errors, especially while interpreting complex program structures, as well as general hallucinations. This highlights key areas for improvement in the formal reasoning capabilities of LLMs.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12686v1
Fair Termination of Asynchronous Binary Sessions,"We study a theory of asynchronous session types ensuring that well-typed processes terminate under a suitable fairness assumption. Fair termination entails starvation freedom and orphan message freedom namely that all messages, including those that are produced early taking advantage of asynchrony, are eventually consumed. The theory is based on a novel fair asynchronous subtyping relation for session types that is coarser than the existing ones. The type system is also the first of its kind that is firmly rooted in linear logic: fair asynchronous subtyping is incorporated as a natural generalization of the cut and axiom rules of linear logic and asynchronous communication is modeled through a suitable set of commuting conversions and of deep cut reductions in linear logic proofs.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07273v2
Active Learning of Symbolic NetKAT Automata,"NetKAT is a domain-specific programming language and logic that has been successfully used to specify and verify the behavior of packet-switched networks. This paper develops techniques for automatically learning NetKAT models of unknown networks using active learning. Prior work has explored active learning for a wide range of automata (e.g., deterministic, register, B\""uchi, timed etc.) and also developed applications, such as validating implementations of network protocols. We present algorithms for learning different types of NetKAT automata, including symbolic automata proposed in recent work. We prove the soundness of these algorithms, build a prototype implementation, and evaluate it on a standard benchmark. Our results highlight the applicability of symbolic NetKAT learning for realistic network configurations and topologies.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13794v1
Qutes: A High-Level Quantum Programming Language for Simplified Quantum   Computing,"Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations far beyond the capabilities of classical systems, particularly in fields such as cryptography and optimization. However, current quantum programming languages often require low-level implementation, posing significant barriers for many developers due to their steep learning curve and limited abstraction. In response, we introduce \textbf{Qutes}, a high-level quantum programming language designed to simplify quantum algorithm development while maintaining the flexibility required for advanced applications. By abstracting complex quantum operations and allowing intuitive expressions through high-level constructs, Qutes enables users to write efficient quantum programs without extensive knowledge of quantum mechanics or circuit design. Built upon Qiskit, Qutes translates its syntax directly into executable quantum code, facilitating seamless integration with quantum hardware. This paper provides an overview of the language's architecture, core functionalities, and its ability to unify classical and quantum operations within a single framework. Additionally, we demonstrate Qutes' application in key quantum algorithms, showcasing its potential to make quantum programming more accessible and practical for a wider range of developers and researchers.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13084v1
"CoreDPPL: Towards a Sound Composition of Differentiation, ODE Solving,   and Probabilistic Programming","In recent years, there has been extensive research on how to extend general-purpose programming language semantics with domain-specific modeling constructs. Two areas of particular interest are (i) universal probabilistic programming where Bayesian probabilistic models are encoded as programs, and (ii) differentiable programming where differentiation operators are first class or differential equations are part of the language semantics. These kinds of languages and their language constructs are usually studied separately or composed in restrictive ways. In this paper, we study and formalize the combination of probabilistic programming constructs, first-class differentiation, and ordinary differential equations in a higher-order setting. We propose formal semantics for a core of such differentiable probabilistic programming language (DPPL), where the type system tracks random computations and rejects unsafe compositions during type checking. The semantics and its type system are formalized, mechanized, and proven sound in Agda with respect to abstract language constructs.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13970v1
Open-Source AI-Powered Optimization in Scalene: Advancing Python   Performance Profiling with DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA 3.2,"Python's flexibility and ease of use come at the cost of performance inefficiencies, requiring developers to rely on profilers to optimize execution. SCALENE, a high-performance CPU, GPU, and memory profiler, provides fine-grained insights into Python applications while running significantly faster than traditional profilers. Originally, SCALENE integrated OpenAI's API to generate AI-powered optimization suggestions, but its reliance on a proprietary API limited accessibility. This study explores the feasibility of using opensource large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1 and Llama 3.2, to generate optimization recommendations within SCALENE. Our evaluation reveals that DeepSeek-R1 provides effective code optimizations comparable to proprietary models. We integrate DeepSeek-R1 into SCALENE to automatically analyze performance bottlenecks and suggest improvements, enhancing SCALENE's utility while maintaining its open-source nature. This study demonstrates that open-source LLMs can be viable alternatives for AI-driven code optimization, paving the way for more accessible and cost-effective performance analysis tools.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10299v1
HpC: A Calculus for Hybrid and Mobile Systems -- Full Version,"Networked cybernetic and physical systems of the Internet of Things (IoT) immerse civilian and industrial infrastructures into an interconnected and dynamic web of hybrid and mobile devices. The key feature of such systems is the hybrid and tight coupling of mobile and pervasive discrete communications in a continuously evolving environment (discrete computations with predominant continuous dynamics). In the aim of ensuring the correctness and reliability of such heterogeneous infrastructures, we introduce the hybrid {\pi}-calculus (HpC), to formally capture both mobility, pervasiveness and hybridisation in infrastructures where the network topology and its communicating entities evolve continuously in the physical world. The {\pi}-calculus proposed by Robin Milner et al. is a process calculus that can model mobile communications and computations in a very elegant manner. The HpC we propose is a conservative extension of the classical {\pi}-calculus, i.e., the extension is ``minimal'', and yet describes mobility, time and physics of systems, while allowing to lift all theoretical results (e.g. bisimulation) to the context of that extension. We showcase the HpC by considering a realistic handover protocol among mobile devices.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09430v1
Scalable Memory Recycling for Large Quantum Programs,"As quantum computing technology advances, the complexity of quantum algorithms increases, necessitating a shift from low-level circuit descriptions to high-level programming paradigms. This paper addresses the challenges of developing a compilation algorithm that optimizes memory management and scales well for bigger, more complex circuits. Our approach models the high-level quantum code as a control flow graph and presents a workflow that searches for a topological sort that maximizes opportunities for qubit reuse. Various heuristics for qubit reuse strategies handle the trade-off between circuit width and depth. We also explore scalability issues in large circuits, suggesting methods to mitigate compilation bottlenecks. By analyzing the structure of the circuit, we are able to identify sub-problems that can be solved separately, without a significant effect on circuit quality, while reducing runtime significantly. This method lays the groundwork for future advancements in quantum programming and compiler optimization by incorporating scalability into quantum memory management.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00822v1
L0-Reasoning Bench: Evaluating Procedural Correctness in Language Models   via Simple Program Execution,"Complex reasoning tasks often rely on the ability to consistently and accurately apply simple rules across incremental steps, a foundational capability which we term ""level-0"" reasoning. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce L0-Bench, a language model benchmark for testing procedural correctness -- the ability to generate correct reasoning processes, complementing existing benchmarks that primarily focus on outcome correctness. Given synthetic Python functions with simple operations, L0-Bench grades models on their ability to generate step-by-step, error-free execution traces. The synthetic nature of L0-Bench enables systematic and scalable generation of test programs along various axes (e.g., number of trace steps). We evaluate a diverse array of recent closed-source and open-weight models on a baseline test set. All models exhibit degradation as the number of target trace steps increases, while larger models and reasoning-enhanced models better maintain correctness over multiple steps. Additionally, we use L0-Bench to explore test-time scaling along three dimensions: input context length, number of solutions for majority voting, and inference steps. Our results suggest substantial room to improve ""level-0"" reasoning and potential directions to build more reliable reasoning systems.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22832v2
Towards LLM-based optimization compilers. Can LLMs learn how to apply a   single peephole optimization? Reasoning is all LLMs need!,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in various language processing tasks, and recent studies have explored their application in compiler optimizations. However, all these studies focus on the conventional open-source LLMs, such as Llama2, which lack enhanced reasoning mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the errors produced by the fine-tuned 7B-parameter Llama2 model as it attempts to learn and apply a simple peephole optimization for the AArch64 assembly code. We provide an analysis of the errors produced by the LLM and compare it with state-of-the-art OpenAI models which implement advanced reasoning logic, including GPT-4o and GPT-o1 (preview). We demonstrate that OpenAI GPT-o1, despite not being fine-tuned, outperforms the fine-tuned Llama2 and GPT-4o. Our findings indicate that this advantage is largely due to the chain-of-thought reasoning implemented in GPT-o1. We hope our work will inspire further research on using LLMs with enhanced reasoning mechanisms and chain-of-thought for code generation and optimization.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12163v1
Finding $\forall\exists$ Hyperbugs using Symbolic Execution,"Many important hyperproperties, such as refinement and generalized non-interference, fall into the class of $\forall\exists$ hyperproperties and require, for each execution trace of a system, the existence of another trace relating to the first one in a certain way. The alternation of quantifiers renders $\forall\exists$ hyperproperties extremely difficult to verify, or even just to test. Indeed, contrary to trace properties, where it suffices to find a single counterexample trace, refuting a $\forall\exists$ hyperproperty requires not only to find a trace, but also a proof that no second trace satisfies the specified relation with the first trace. As a consequence, automated testing of $\forall\exists$ hyperproperties falls out of the scope of existing automated testing tools. In this paper, we present a fully automated approach to detect violations of $\forall\exists$ hyperproperties in software systems. Our approach extends bug-finding techniques based on symbolic execution with support for trace quantification. We provide a prototype implementation of our approach, and demonstrate its effectiveness on a set of challenging examples.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07918v1
Imperative vs. Declarative Programming Paradigms for Open-Universe Scene   Generation,"Synthesizing 3D scenes from open-vocabulary text descriptions is a challenging, important, and recently-popular application. One of its critical subproblems is layout generation: given a set of objects, lay them out to produce a scene matching the input description. Nearly all recent work adopts a declarative paradigm for this problem: using LLM to generate specification of constraints between objects, then solving those constraints to produce the final layout. In contrast, we explore an alternative imperative paradigm, in which an LLM iteratively places objects, with each object's position and orientation computed as a function of previously-placed objects. The imperative approach allows for a simpler scene specification language while also handling a wider variety and larger complexity of scenes. We further improve the robustness of our imperative scheme by developing an error correction mechanism that iteratively improves the scene's validity while staying as close as possible the original layout generated by the LLM. In forced-choice perceptual studies, participants preferred layouts generated by our imperative approach 82% and 94% of the time, respectively, when compared against two declarative layout generation methods. We also present a simple, automated evaluation metric for 3D scene layout generation that aligns well with human preferences.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05482v1
Destination Calculus: A Linear λ-Calculus for Purely Functional   Memory Writes,"Destination passing -- aka. out parameters -- is taking a parameter to fill rather than returning a result from a function. Due to its apparently imperative nature, destination passing has struggled to find its way to pure functional programming. In this paper, we present a pure functional calculus with destinations at its core. Our calculus subsumes all the similar systems, and can be used to reason about their correctness or extension. In addition, our calculus can express programs that were previously not known to be expressible in a pure language. This is guaranteed by a modal type system where modes are used to manage both linearity and scopes. Type safety of our core calculus was proved formally with the Coq proof assistant.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07489v1
JustinANN: Realistic Test Generation for Java Programs Driven by   Annotations,"Automated test case generation is important. However, the automatically generated test input does not always make sense, and the automated assertion is difficult to validate against the program under test. In this paper, we propose JustinANN, a flexible and scalable tool to generate test cases for Java programs, providing realistic test inputs and assertions. We have observed that, in practice, Java programs contain a large number of annotations from programs, which can be considered as part of the user specification. We design a systematic annotation set with 7 kinds of annotations and 4 combination rules based on them to modify complex Java objects. Annotations that modify the fields or return variables of methods can be used to generate assertions that represent the true intent of the program, and the ones that modify the input parameters can be used to generate test inputs that match the real business requirement. We have conducted experiments to evaluate the approach on open source Java programs. The results show that the annotations and their combinations designed in this paper are compatible with existing annotations; our approach is easier to generate test data in, on and outside the boundaries of the requirement domain; and it also helps to find program defects.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05715v1
Products of Recursive Programs for Hypersafety Verification,"We study the problem of automated hypersafety verification of infinite-state recursive programs. We propose an infinite class of product programs, specifically designed with recursion in mind, that reduce the hypersafety verification of a recursive program to standard safety verification. For this, we combine insights from language theory and concurrency theory to propose an algorithmic solution for constructing an infinite class of recursive product programs. One key insight is that, using the simple theory of visibly pushdown languages, one can maintain the recursive structure of syntactic program alignments which is vital to constructing a new product program that can be viewed as a classic recursive program -- that is, one that can be executed on a single stack. Another key insight is that techniques from concurrency theory can be generalized to help define product programs based on the view that the parallel composition of individual recursive programs includes all possible alignments from which a sound set of alignments that faithfully preserve the satisfaction of the hypersafety property can be selected. On the practical side, we formulate a family of parametric canonical product constructions that are intuitive to programmers and can be used as building blocks to specify recursive product programs for the purpose of relational and hypersafety verification, with the idea that the right product program can be verified automatically using existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques through an implementation and highly promising experimental results.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10800v1
Safe and usable kernel extensions with Rex,"Safe kernel extensions have gained significant traction, evolving from simple packet filters to large, complex programs that customize storage, networking, and scheduling. Existing kernel extension mechanisms like eBPF rely on in-kernel verifiers to ensure safety of kernel extensions by static verification using symbolic execution. We identify significant usability issues -- safe extensions being rejected by the verifier -- due to the language-verifier gap, a mismatch between developers' expectation of program safety provided by a contract with the programming language, and the verifier's expectation.   We present Rex, a new kernel extension framework that closes the language-verifier gap and improves the usability of kernel extensions in terms of programming experience and maintainability. Rex builds upon language-based safety to provide safety properties desired by kernel extensions, along with a lightweight extralingual runtime for properties that are unsuitable for static analysis, including safe exception handling, stack safety, and termination. With Rex, kernel extensions are written in safe Rust and interact with the kernel via a safe interface provided by Rex's kernel crate. No separate static verification is needed. Rex addresses usability issues of eBPF kernel extensions without compromising performance.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18832v2
An Attempt to Catch Up with JIT Compilers: The False Lead of Optimizing   Inline Caches,"Context: Just-in-Time (JIT) compilers are able to specialize the code they generate according to a continuous profiling of the running programs. This gives them an advantage when compared to Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilers that must choose the code to generate once for all.   Inquiry: Is it possible to improve the performance of AoT compilers by adding Dynamic Binary Modification (DBM) to the executions?   Approach: We added to the Hopc AoT JavaScript compiler a new optimization based on DBM to the inline cache (IC), a classical optimization dynamic languages use to implement object property accesses efficiently.   Knowledge: Reducing the number of memory accesses as the new optimization does, does not shorten execution times on contemporary architectures.   Grounding: The DBM optimization we have implemented is fully operational on x86_64 architectures. We have conducted several experiments to evaluate its impact on performance and to study the reasons of the lack of acceleration.   Importance: The (negative) result we present in this paper sheds new light on the best strategy to be used to implement dynamic languages. It tells that the old days were removing instructions or removing memory reads always yielded to speed up is over. Nowadays, implementing sophisticated compiler optimizations is only worth the effort if the processor is not able by itself to accelerate the code. This result applies to AoT compilers as well as JIT compilers.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20547v1
DiagrammaticLearning: A Graphical Language for Compositional Training   Regimes,"Motivated by deep learning regimes with multiple interacting yet distinct model components, we introduce learning diagrams, graphical depictions of training setups that capture parameterized learning as data rather than code. A learning diagram compiles to a unique loss function on which component models are trained. The result of training on this loss is a collection of models whose predictions ``agree"" with one another. We show that a number of popular learning setups such as few-shot multi-task learning, knowledge distillation, and multi-modal learning can be depicted as learning diagrams. We further implement learning diagrams in a library that allows users to build diagrams of PyTorch and Flux.jl models. By implementing some classic machine learning use cases, we demonstrate how learning diagrams allow practitioners to build complicated models as compositions of smaller components, identify relationships between workflows, and manipulate models during or after training. Leveraging a category theoretic framework, we introduce a rigorous semantics for learning diagrams that puts such operations on a firm mathematical foundation.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01515v1
Satire: Computing Rigorous Bounds for Floating-Point Rounding Error in   Mixed-Precision Loop-Free Programs,"Techniques that rigorously bound the overall rounding error exhibited by a numerical program are of significant interest for communities developing numerical software. However, there are few available tools today that can be used to rigorously bound errors in programs that employ conditional statements (a basic need) as well as mixed-precision arithmetic (a direction of significant future interest) employing global optimization in error analysis. In this paper, we present a new tool that fills this void while also employing an abstraction-guided optimization approach to allow designers to trade error-bound tightness for gains in analysis time -- useful when searching for design alternatives. We first present the basic rigorous analysis framework of Satire and then show how to extend it to incorporate abstractions, conditionals, and mixed-precision arithmetic. We begin by describing Satire's design and its performance on a collection of benchmark examples. We then describe these aspects of Satire: (1) how the error-bound and tool execution time vary with the abstraction level; (2) the additional machinery to handle conditional expression branches, including defining the concepts of instability jumps and instability window widths and measuring these quantities; and (3) how the error changes when a mix of precision values are used. To showcase how \satire can add value during design, we start with a Conjugate Gradient solver and demonstrate how its step size and search direction are affected by different precision settings. Satire is freely available for evaluation, and can be used during the design of numerical routines to effect design tradeoffs guided by rigorous empirical error guarantees.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05924v1
What does it take to certify conversion?,"We report on a detailed exploration of the properties of conversion (definitional equality) in dependent type theory, with the goal of certifying decision procedures for it. While in that context the property of normalisation has attracted the most light, we instead emphasize the importance of injectivity properties, showing that they alone are both crucial and sufficient to certify most desirable properties of conversion checkers.   We also explore the certification of a fully untyped conversion checker, with respect to a typed specification, and show that the story is mostly unchanged, although the exact injectivity properties needed are subtly different.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15500v1
A Type Theory for Comprehension Categories with Applications to   Subtyping,"In this paper we develop a type theory that we show is an internal language for comprehension categories. This type theory is closely related to Martin-L\""of type theory (MLTT). Indeed, semantics of MLTT are often given in comprehension categories, albeit usually only in discrete or full ones. As we explain, requiring a comprehension category to be full or discrete can be understood as removing one `dimension' of morphisms. Thus, in our syntax, we recover this extra dimension. We show that this extra dimension can be used to encode subtyping in a natural way. Important instances of non-full comprehension categories include ones used for constructive or univalent intensional models of MLTT and directed type theory, and so our syntax is a more faithful internal language for these than is MLTT.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10868v1
Flowco: Rethinking Data Analysis in the Age of LLMs,"Conducting data analysis typically involves authoring code to transform, visualize, analyze, and interpret data. Large language models (LLMs) are now capable of generating such code for simple, routine analyses. LLMs promise to democratize data science by enabling those with limited programming expertise to conduct data analyses, including in scientific research, business, and policymaking. However, analysts in many real-world settings must often exercise fine-grained control over specific analysis steps, verify intermediate results explicitly, and iteratively refine their analytical approaches. Such tasks present barriers to building robust and reproducible analyses using LLMs alone or even in conjunction with existing authoring tools (e.g., computational notebooks). This paper introduces Flowco, a new mixed-initiative system to address these challenges. Flowco leverages a visual dataflow programming model and integrates LLMs into every phase of the authoring process. A user study suggests that Flowco supports analysts, particularly those with less programming experience, in quickly authoring, debugging, and refining data analyses.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14038v1
Garbage Collection for Rust: The Finalizer Frontier,"Rust is a non-Garbage Collected (GCed) language, but the lack of GC makes expressing data-structures that require shared ownership awkward, inefficient, or both. In this paper we explore a new design for, and implementation of, GC in Rust, called Alloy. Unlike previous approaches to GC in Rust, Alloy maps existing Rust destructors to finalizers: this makes GC in Rust natural to use but introduces surprising soundness, performance, and ergonomic problems. Alloy provides solutions for each of these problems.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01841v2
A refined operational semantics for FreeCHR,"Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is a rule-based programming language that which is typically embedded into a general-purpose language with a plethora of implementations. However, the existing implementations often re-invent the way to embed CHR, which impedes maintenance and weakens assertions of correctness. To formalize and thereby unify the embedding of CHR into arbitrary host languages, we recently introduced the framework FreeCHR and proved it to be a valid representation of classical CHR. Until now, this framework only includes a translation of the very abstract operational semantics of CHR which, due to its abstract nature, introduces several practical issues. In this paper we present a definition of the refined operational semantics for FreeCHR and prove it to be both, a valid concretization of the very abstract semantics of FreeCHR, and an equivalent representation of the refined semantics of CHR. This will establish implementations of FreeCHR as equivalent in behavior and expressiveness to existing implementations of CHR.

Dead Gate Elimination,"Hybrid quantum algorithms combine the strengths of quantum and classical computing. Many quantum algorithms, such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), leverage this synergy. However, quantum circuits are executed in full, even when only subsets of measurement outcomes contribute to subsequent classical computations. In this manuscript, we propose a novel circuit optimization technique that identifies and removes dead gates. We prove that the removal of dead gates has no influence on the probability distribution of the measurement outcomes that contribute to the subsequent calculation result. We implemented and evaluated our optimization on a VQE instance, a quantum phase estimation (QPE) instance, and hybrid programs embedded with random circuits of varying circuit width, confirming its capability to remove a non-trivial number of dead gates in real-world algorithms. The effect of our optimization scales up as more measurement outcomes are identified as non-contributory, resulting in a proportionally greater reduction of dead gates.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12729v2
Rel: A Programming Language for Relational Data,"From the moment of their inception, languages for relational data have been described as sublanguages embedded in a host programming language. Rel is a new relational language whose key design goal is to go beyond this paradigm with features that allow for programming in the large, making it possible to fully describe end to end application semantics. With the new approach we can model the semantics of entire enterprise applications relationally, which helps significantly reduce architecture complexity and avoid the well-known impedance mismatch problem. This paradigm shift is enabled by 50 years of database research, making it possible to revisit the sublanguage/host language paradigm, starting from the fundamental principles. We present the main features of Rel: those that give it the power to express traditional query language operations and those that are designed to grow the language and allow programming in the large.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10323v2
Pathological Cases for a Class of Reachability-Based Garbage Collectors,"Although existing garbage collectors (GCs) perform extremely well on typical programs, there still exist pathological programs for which modern GCs significantly degrade performance. This observation begs the question: might there exist a 'holy grail' GC algorithm, as yet undiscovered, guaranteeing both constant-length pause times and that memory is collected promptly upon becoming unreachable? For decades, researchers have understood that such a GC is not always possible, i.e., some pathological behavior is unavoidable when the program can make heap cycles and operates near the memory limit, regardless of the GC algorithm used. However, this understanding has until now been only informal, lacking a rigorous formal proof.   This paper complements that informal understanding with a rigorous proof, showing with mathematical certainty that every GC that can implement a realistic mutator-observer interface has some pathological program that forces it to either introduce a long GC pause into program execution or reject an allocation even though there is available space. Hence, language designers must either accept these pathological scenarios and design heuristic approaches that minimize their impact (e.g., generational collection), or restrict programs and environments to a strict subset of the behaviors allowed by our mutator-observer-style interface (e.g., by enforcing a type system that disallows cycles or overprovisioning memory).",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11654v1
An Encoding of Interaction Nets in OCaml,"Interaction nets constitute a visual programming language grounded in graph transformation.

To achieve this objective, we encode not only the interaction net primitives, but also Lafont's original type system.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20463v1
Relating Answer Set Programming and Many-sorted Logics for Formal   Verification,"Answer Set Programming (ASP) is an important logic programming paradigm within the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. As a concise, human-readable, declarative language, ASP is an excellent tool for developing trustworthy (especially, artificially intelligent) software systems. However, formally verifying ASP programs offers some unique challenges, such as   1. a lack of modularity (the meanings of rules are difficult to define in isolation from the enclosing program),   2. the ground-and-solve semantics (the meanings of rules are dependent on the input data with which the program is grounded), and   3. limitations of existing tools.   My research agenda has been focused on addressing these three issues with the intention of making ASP verification an accessible, routine task that is regularly performed alongside program development. In this vein, I have investigated alternative semantics for ASP based on translations into the logic of here-and-there and many-sorted first-order logic. These semantics promote a modular understanding of logic programs, bypass grounding, and enable us to use automated theorem provers to automatically verify properties of programs.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09230v1
From Informal to Formal -- Incorporating and Evaluating LLMs on Natural   Language Requirements to Verifiable Formal Proofs,"The research in AI-based formal mathematical reasoning has shown an unstoppable growth trend. These studies have excelled in mathematical competitions like IMO and have made significant progress. This paper focuses on formal verification, an immediate application scenario of formal reasoning, and breaks it down into sub-tasks. We constructed 18k high-quality instruction-response pairs across five formal specification languages (Coq, Lean4, Dafny, ACSL, and TLA+) by distilling gpt-4o and evaluated against ten open-sourced LLMs, including recent popular DeepSeek-R1. We also fine-tuned several 7~8B small models to achieve comparable performance with Deepseek-R1-671B. Interestingly, we observed that fine-tuning with formal data also enhances mathematics, reasoning, and coding capabilities. Fine-tuned models are released at https: //huggingface.co/fm-universe.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16207v3
"Smooth, Integrated Proofs of Cryptographic Constant Time for   Nondeterministic Programs and Compilers","Formal verification of software and compilers has been used to rule out large classes of security-critical issues, but risk of unintentional information leakage has received much less consideration. It is a key requirement for formal specifications to leave some details of a system's behavior unspecified so that future implementation changes can be accommodated, and yet it is nonetheless expected that these choices would not be made based on confidential information the system handles. This paper formalizes that notion using omnisemantics and plain single-copy assertions, giving for the first time a specification of what it means for a nondeterministic program to be constant-time or more generally to avoid leaking (a part of) its inputs. We use this theory to prove data-leak-free execution of core cryptographic routines compiled from Bedrock2 C to RISC-V machine code, showing that the smooth specification and proof experience omnisemantics provides for nondeterminism extends to constant-time properties in the same setting. We also study variants of the key program-compiler contract, highlighting pitfalls of tempting simplifications and subtle consequences of how inputs to nondeterministic choices are constrained. Our results are backed by modular program-logic and compiler-correctness theorems, and they integrate into a neat end-to-end theorem in the Coq proof assistant.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15550v1

Annotating and Auditing the Safety Properties of Unsafe Rust,"Unsafe code is a critical topic in ensuring the security of system software development in Rust. It is the sole source of potential undefined behaviors, assuming the compiler is sound. To avoid the misuse of unsafe code, Rust developers should provide clear safety property annotations for unsafe APIs. However, there is limited official guidance and few best practices for annotating unsafe code. Even the current best practices for safety property annotations in the Rust standard library are ad hoc and informal. In this paper, we design a domain-specific language to describe the safety properties of unsafe APIs, which may serve as a precursor for automated verification in the future. Furthermore, to ensure that the caller of an unsafe API properly delegates the safety property required by the callee, we propose a novel unsafety propagation graph to model the usage and propagation of unsafe code. Based on this graph, we further introduce a method to partition the graph into smaller graphs, such that each graph serves as a self-contained audit unit for examining the soundness of unsafe code encapsulation and safety property annotation. We applied our approach to the Rust standard library, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method is both practical and effective. Additionally, we have fixed safety property description issues in 23 APIs.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21312v1
A Formal Framework for Naturally Specifying and Verifying Sequential   Algorithms,"Current approaches for formal verification of algorithms face important limitations. For specification, they cannot express algorithms naturally and concisely, especially for algorithms with states and flexible control flow. For verification, formal proof based on Hoare logic cannot reflect the logical structure of natural proof. To address these challenges, we introduce a formal framework for naturally specifying and verifying sequential algorithms in Coq. We use the state relation monad to integrate Coq's expressive type system with the flexible control flow of imperative languages. It supports nondeterministic operations and customizable program states, enabling specifying algorithms at an appropriate level of abstraction. For verification, we build a Hoare logic for the monad and propose a novel two-stage proof approach that separates natural logical reasoning from mechanical composition. It reflects the logical structure of natural proof, enhancing modularity and readability. We evaluate the framework by formalizing the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm and verifying the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19852v2
Fray: An Efficient General-Purpose Concurrency Testing Platform for the   JVM,"Concurrency bugs are hard to discover and reproduce. Prior work has developed sophisticated algorithms to search for concurrency bugs, such as partial order sampling (POS); however, fundamental limitations with existing platforms for concurrency control hinder effective testing of real-world software. We observe that the design space for concurrency control on managed code involves complex trade-offs between expressibility, applicability, and maintainability on the one hand, and bug-finding efficiency on the other hand.   This paper presents Fray, a platform for performing push-button concurrency testing of data-race-free JVM programs. The key insight behind Fray is that effective controlled concurrency testing requires orchestrating thread interleavings without replacing existing concurrency primitives, while encoding their semantics for faithfully expressing the set of all possible program behaviors. Fray incorporates a novel concurrency control mechanism called shadow locking, designed to make controlled concurrency testing practical and efficient for JVM programs. In an empirical evaluation on 53 benchmark programs with known bugs (SCTBench and JaConTeBe), Fray with random search finds 70% more bugs than JPF and 77% more bugs than RR's chaos mode. We also demonstrate Fray's push-button applicability on 2,655 tests from Apache Kafka, Lucene, and Google Guava. In these mature projects, Fray successfully discovered 18 real-world concurrency bugs that can cause 363 tests to fail reproducibly.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12618v1
Using Read Promotion and Mixed Isolation Levels for Performant Yet   Serializable Execution of Transaction Programs,"We propose a theory that can determine the lowest isolation level that can be allocated to each transaction program in an application in a mixed-isolation-level setting, to guarantee that all executions will be serializable and thus preserve all integrity constraints, even those that are not explicitly declared. This extends prior work applied to completely known transactions, to deal with the realistic situation where transactions are generated by running programs with parameters that are not known in advance. Using our theory, we propose an optimization method that allows for high throughput while ensuring that all executions are serializable. Our method is based on searching for application code modifications that are semantics-preserving while improving the isolation level allocation. We illustrate our approach to the SmallBank benchmark.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18377v2
Denotational Semantics for Probabilistic and Concurrent Programs,"We develop a denotational model for programs that have standard programming constructs such as conditionals and while-loops, as well as probabilistic and concurrent commands. Whereas semantic models for languages with either concurrency or randomization are well studied, their combination is limited to languages with bounded loops. Our work is the first to consider both randomization and concurrency for a language with unbounded looping constructs. The interaction between Boolean tests (arising from the control flow structures), probabilistic actions, and concurrent execution creates challenges in generalizing previous work on pomsets and convex languages, prominent models for those effects, individually. To illustrate the generality of our model, we show that it recovers a typical powerdomain semantics for concurrency, as well as the convex powerset semantics for probabilistic nondeterminism.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02768v1
Weighted GKAT: Completeness and Complexity,"We propose Weighted Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (wGKAT), an uninterpreted weighted programming language equipped with branching, conditionals, and loops.

We also provide a polynomial time decision procedure for bisimulation equivalence.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20385v1
Reasoning-SQL: Reinforcement Learning with SQL Tailored Partial Rewards   for Reasoning-Enhanced Text-to-SQL,"Text-to-SQL is a challenging task involving multiple reasoning-intensive subtasks, including natural language understanding, database schema comprehension, and precise SQL query formulation. Existing approaches often rely on handcrafted reasoning paths with inductive biases that can limit their overall effectiveness. Motivated by the recent success of reasoning-enhanced models such as DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o1, which effectively leverage reward-driven self-exploration to enhance reasoning capabilities and generalization, we propose a novel set of partial rewards tailored specifically for the Text-to-SQL task. Our reward set includes schema-linking, AI feedback, n-gram similarity, and syntax check, explicitly designed to address the reward sparsity issue prevalent in reinforcement learning (RL). Leveraging group relative policy optimization (GRPO), our approach explicitly encourages large language models (LLMs) to develop intrinsic reasoning skills necessary for accurate SQL query generation. With models of different sizes, we demonstrate that RL-only training with our proposed rewards consistently achieves higher accuracy and superior generalization compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Remarkably, our RL-trained 14B-parameter model significantly outperforms larger proprietary models, e.g. o3-mini by 4% and Gemini-1.5-Pro-002 by 3% on the BIRD benchmark. These highlight the efficacy of our proposed RL-training framework with partial rewards for enhancing both accuracy and reasoning capabilities in Text-to-SQL tasks.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23157v2
A Probabilistic Choreography Language for PRISM,"We present a choreographic framework for modelling and   analysing concurrent probabilistic systems based on the PRISM   model-checker. This is achieved through the development of a   choreography language, which is a specification language that allows   to describe the desired interactions within a concurrent system from   a global viewpoint. Using choreographies gives a clear and complete   view of system interactions, making it easier to understand the   process flow and identify potential errors, which helps ensure   correct execution and improves system reliability. We equip our   language with a probabilistic semantics and then define a formal   encoding into the PRISM language and discuss its   correctness. Properties of programs written in our choreographic   language can be model-checked by the PRISM model-checker via their   translation into the PRISM language. Finally, we implement a   compiler for our language and demonstrate its practical   applicability via examples drawn from the use cases featured in the   PRISM website.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08530v1
LLM-Driven Multi-step Translation from C to Rust using Static Analysis,"Translating software written in legacy languages to modern languages, such as C to Rust, has significant benefits in improving memory safety while maintaining high performance. However, manual translation is cumbersome, error-prone, and produces unidiomatic code. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in producing idiomatic translations, but offer no correctness guarantees as they lack the ability to capture all the semantics differences between the source and target languages. To resolve this issue, we propose SACTOR, an LLM-driven C-to-Rust zero-shot translation tool using a two-step translation methodology: an ""unidiomatic"" step to translate C into Rust while preserving semantics, and an ""idiomatic"" step to refine the code to follow Rust's semantic standards. SACTOR utilizes information provided by static analysis of the source C program to address challenges such as pointer semantics and dependency resolution. To validate the correctness of the translated result from each step, we use end-to-end testing via the foreign function interface to embed our translated code segment into the original code. We evaluate the translation of 200 programs from two datasets and two case studies, comparing the performance of GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Llama 3.3 70B and DeepSeek-R1 in SACTOR. Our results demonstrate that SACTOR achieves high correctness and improved idiomaticity, with the best-performing model (DeepSeek-R1) reaching 93% and (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, DeepSeek-R1) reaching 84% correctness (on each dataset, respectively), while producing more natural and Rust-compliant translations compared to existing methods.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12511v2
A Unified Framework for Quantitative Cache Analysis,"In this work we unify two existing lines of work towards cache analysis for non-LRU policies. To this end, we extend the notion of competitiveness to block competitiveness and systematically analyze the competitiveness and block competitiveness of FIFO and MRU relative to LRU for arbitrary associativities. We show how competitiveness and block competitiveness can be exploited in state-of-the-art WCET analysis based on the results of existing persistence analyses for LRU. Unlike prior work, our approach is applicable to microarchitectures that exhibit timing anomalies. We experimentally evaluate the precision and cost of our approach on benchmarks from TACLeBench. The experiments demonstrate that quantitative cache analysis for FIFO and MRU comes close to the precision of LRU.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16588v3
Polygon: Symbolic Reasoning for SQL using Conflict-Driven   Under-Approximation Search,"We present a novel symbolic reasoning engine for SQL which can efficiently generate an input $I$ for $n$ queries $P_1, \cdots, P_n$, such that their outputs on $I$ satisfy a given property (expressed in SMT). This is useful in different contexts, such as disproving equivalence of two SQL queries and disambiguating a set of queries. Our first idea is to reason about an under-approximation of each $P_i$ -- that is, a subset of $P_i$'s input-output behaviors. While it makes our approach both semantics-aware and lightweight, this idea alone is incomplete (as a fixed under-approximation might miss some behaviors of interest). Therefore, our second idea is to perform search over an expressive family of under-approximations (which collectively cover all program behaviors of interest), thereby making our approach complete. We have implemented these ideas in a tool, Polygon, and evaluated it on over 30,000 benchmarks across two tasks (namely, SQL equivalence refutation and query disambiguation). Our evaluation results show that Polygon significantly outperforms all prior techniques.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06542v1
Synthesizing Optimal Object Selection Predicates for Image Editing using   Lattices,"Image editing is a common task across a wide range of domains, from personal use to professional applications. Despite advances in computer vision, current tools still demand significant manual effort for editing tasks that require repetitive operations on images with many objects. In this paper, we present a novel approach to automating the image editing process using program synthesis. We propose a new algorithm based on lattice structures to automatically synthesize object selection predicates for image editing from positive and negative examples. By leveraging the algebraic properties of lattices, our algorithm efficiently synthesizes an optimal object selection predicate among multiple correct solutions. We have implemented our technique and evaluated it on 100 tasks over 20 images. The evaluation result demonstrates our tool is effective and efficient, which outperforms state-of-the-art synthesizers and LLM-based approaches.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03155v1
Scaling Optimization Over Uncertainty via Compilation,"Probabilistic inference is fundamentally hard, yet many tasks require optimization on top of inference, which is even harder. We present a new optimization-via-compilation strategy to scalably solve a certain class of such problems. In particular, we introduce a new intermediate representation (IR), binary decision diagrams weighted by a novel notion of branch-and-bound semiring, that enables a scalable branch-and-bound based optimization procedure. This IR automatically factorizes problems through program structure and prunes suboptimal values via a straightforward branch-and-bound style algorithm to find optima. Additionally, the IR is naturally amenable to staged compilation, allowing the programmer to query for optima mid-compilation to inform further executions of the program. We showcase the effectiveness and flexibility of the IR by implementing two performant languages that both compile to it: dappl and pineappl. dappl is a functional language that solves maximum expected utility problems with first-class support for rewards, decision making, and conditioning. pineappl is an imperative language that performs exact probabilistic inference with support for nested marginal maximum a posteriori (MMAP) optimization via staging.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18728v2
Proceedings of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth International Workshop on   Graph Computation Models,"This volume contains the post-proceedings of the Fourteenth and the Fifteenth International Workshops on Graph Computation Models (GCM 2023 and 2024).

It promotes the cross-fertilizing exchange of ideas and experiences among senior and young researchers from the different communities interested in the foundations, applications, and implementations of graph computation models and related areas.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19632v1
Automatically Verifying Replication-aware Linearizability,"Data replication is crucial for enabling fault tolerance and uniform low latency in modern decentralized applications. Replicated Data Types (RDTs) have emerged as a principled approach for developing replicated implementations of basic data structures such as counter, flag, set, map, etc. While the correctness of RDTs is generally specified using the notion of strong eventual consistency--which guarantees that replicas that have received the same set of updates would converge to the same state--a more expressive specification which relates the converged state to updates received at a replica would be more beneficial to RDT users. Replication-aware linearizability is one such specification, which requires all replicas to always be in a state which can be obtained by linearizing the updates received at the replica. In this work, we develop a novel fully automated technique for verifying replication-aware linearizability for Mergeable Replicated Data Types (MRDTs). We identify novel algebraic properties for MRDT operations and the merge function which are sufficient for proving an implementation to be linearizable and which go beyond the standard notions of commutativity, associativity, and idempotence. We also develop a novel inductive technique called bottom-up linearization to automatically verify the required algebraic properties. Our technique can be used to verify both MRDTs and state-based CRDTs. We have successfully applied our approach to a number of complex MRDT and CRDT implementations including a novel JSON MRDT.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19967v1
VeriMind: Agentic LLM for Automated Verilog Generation with a Novel   Evaluation Metric,"Designing Verilog modules requires meticulous attention to correctness, efficiency, and adherence to design specifications. However, manually writing Verilog code remains a complex and time-consuming task that demands both expert knowledge and iterative refinement. Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their structured text generation capabilities, we propose VeriMind, an agentic LLM framework for Verilog code generation that significantly automates and optimizes the synthesis process. Unlike traditional LLM-based code generators, VeriMind employs a structured reasoning approach: given a user-provided prompt describing design requirements, the system first formulates a detailed train of thought before the final Verilog code is generated. This multi-step methodology enhances interpretability, accuracy, and adaptability in hardware design. In addition, we introduce a novel evaluation metric-pass@ARC-which combines the conventional pass@k measure with Average Refinement Cycles (ARC) to capture both success rate and the efficiency of iterative refinement. Experimental results on diverse hardware design tasks demonstrated that our approach achieved up to $8.3\%$ improvement on pass@k metric and $8.1\%$ on pass@ARC metric. These findings underscore the transformative potential of agentic LLMs in automated hardware design, RTL development, and digital system synthesis.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16514v3
Grammar-Based Code Representation: Is It a Worthy Pursuit for LLMs?,"Grammar serves as a cornerstone in programming languages and software engineering, providing frameworks to define the syntactic space and program structure. Existing research demonstrates the effectiveness of grammar-based code representations in small-scale models, showing their ability to reduce syntax errors and enhance performance. However, as language models scale to the billion level or beyond, syntax-level errors become rare, making it unclear whether grammar information still provides performance benefits. To explore this, we develop a series of billion-scale GrammarCoder models, incorporating grammar rules in the code generation process. Experiments on HumanEval (+) and MBPP (+) demonstrate a notable improvement in code generation accuracy. Further analysis shows that grammar-based representations enhance LLMs' ability to discern subtle code differences, reducing semantic errors caused by minor variations. These findings suggest that grammar-based code representations remain valuable even in billion-scale models, not only by maintaining syntax correctness but also by improving semantic differentiation.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05507v1
LLM-Aided Customizable Profiling of Code Data Based On Programming   Language Concepts,"Data profiling is critical in machine learning for generating descriptive statistics, supporting both deeper understanding and downstream tasks like data valuation and curation. This work addresses profiling specifically in the context of code datasets for Large Language Models (code-LLMs), where data quality directly influences tasks such as code generation and summarization. Characterizing code datasets in terms of programming language concepts enables better insights and targeted data curation. Our proposed methodology decomposes code data profiling into two phases: (1) an offline phase where LLMs are leveraged to derive and learn rules for extracting syntactic and semantic concepts across various programming languages, including previously unseen or low-resource languages, and (2) an online deterministic phase applying these derived rules for efficient real-time analysis. This hybrid approach is customizable, extensible to new syntactic and semantic constructs, and scalable to multiple languages. Experimentally, our LLM-aided method achieves a mean accuracy of 90.33% for syntactic extraction rules and semantic classification accuracies averaging 80% and 77% across languages and semantic concepts, respectively.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15571v1

JaxPP automatically distributes tasks, corresponding to pipeline stages, over a cluster of nodes and automatically infers the communication among them.

"GPU accelerated program synthesis: Enumerate semantics, not syntax!","Program synthesis is an umbrella term for generating programs and logical formulae from specifications. With the remarkable performance improvements that GPUs enable for deep learning, a natural question arose: can we also implement a search-based program synthesiser on GPUs to achieve similar performance improvements? In this article we discuss our insights on this question, based on recent works~. The goal is to build a synthesiser running on GPUs which takes as input positive and negative example traces and returns a logical formula accepting the positive and rejecting the negative traces. With GPU-friendly programming techniques -- using the semantics of formulae to minimise data movement and reduce data-dependent branching -- our synthesiser scales to significantly larger synthesis problems, and operates much faster than the previous CPU-based state-of-the-art. We believe the insights that make our approach GPU-friendly have wide potential for enhancing the performance of other formal methods (FM) workloads.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18943v1
Publish on Ping: A Better Way to Publish Reservations in Memory   Reclamation for Concurrent Data Structures,"Safe memory reclamation techniques that utilize per read reservations, such as hazard pointers, often cause significant overhead in traversals of linked concurrent data structures. This is primarily due to the need to announce a reservation, and fence to enforce appropriate ordering, before each read. In read-intensive workloads, this overhead is amplified because, even if relatively little memory reclamation actually occurs, the full overhead of reserving records is still incurred while traversing data structures.   In this paper, we propose a novel memory reclamation technique by combining POSIX signals and delayed reclamation, introducing a publish-on-ping approach. This method eliminates the need to make reservations globally visible before use. Instead, threads privately track which records they are accessing, and share this information on demand with threads that intend to reclaim memory. The approach can serve as a drop-in replacement for hazard pointers and hazard eras. Furthermore, the capability to retain reservations during traversals in data structure operations and publish them on demand facilitates the construction of a variant of hazard pointers (EpochPOP). This variant uses epochs to approach the performance of epoch-based reclamation in the common case where threads are not frequently delayed (while retaining the robustness of hazard pointers).   Our publish-on-ping implementations based on hazard pointers (HP) and hazard eras, when applied to various data structures, exhibit significant performance improvements. The improvements across various workloads and data structures range from 1.2X to 4X over the original HP, up to 20% compared to a heavily optimized HP implementation similar to the one in the Folly open-source library, and up to 3X faster than hazard eras. EpochPOP delivers performance similar to epoch-based reclamation while providing stronger guarantees.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04250v1
Tensor Network Structure Search with Program Synthesis,"Tensor networks provide a powerful framework for compressing multi-dimensional data. The optimal tensor network structure for a given data tensor depends on both data characteristics and specific optimality criteria, making tensor network structure search a difficult problem. Existing solutions typically rely on sampling and compressing numerous candidate structures; these procedures are computationally expensive and therefore limiting for practical applications. We address this challenge by viewing tensor network structure search as a program synthesis problem and introducing an efficient constraint-based assessment method that avoids costly tensor decomposition. Specifically, we establish a correspondence between transformation programs and network structures. We also design a novel operation named output-directed splits to reduce the search space without hindering expressiveness. We then propose a synthesis algorithm to identify promising network candidates through constraint solving, and avoid tensor decomposition for all but the most promising candidates. Experimental results show that our approach improves search speed by up to $10\times$ and achieves compression ratios $1.5\times$ to $3\times$ better than state-of-the-art. Notably, our approach scales to larger tensors that are unattainable by prior work. Furthermore, the discovered topologies generalize well to similar data, yielding compression ratios up to $ 2.4\times$ better than a generic structure while the runtime remains around $110$ seconds.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02711v3
Probabilistic Guarantees for Practical LIA Loop Invariant Automation,"Despite the crucial need for formal safety and security verification of programs, discovering loop invariants remains a significant challenge. Static analysis is a primary technique for inferring loop invariants but often relies on substantial assumptions about underlying theories. Data-driven methods supported by dynamic analysis and machine learning algorithms have shown impressive performance in inferring loop invariants for some challenging programs. However, state-of-the-art data-driven techniques do not offer theoretical guarantees for finding loop invariants. We present a novel technique that leverages the simulated annealing (SA) search algorithm combined with SMT solvers and computational geometry to provide probabilistic guarantees for inferring loop invariants using data-driven methods. Our approach enhances the SA search with real analysis to define the search space and employs parallelism to increase the probability of success. To ensure the convergence of our algorithm, we adapt e-nets, a key concept from computational geometry. Our tool, DLIA2, implements these algorithms and demonstrates competitive performance against state-of-the-art techniques. We also identify a subclass of programs, on which we outperform the current state-of-the-art tool GSpacer.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10657v1
Confluence of Conditional Rewriting Modulo,"Sets of equations E play an important computational role in rewriting-based systems R by defining an equivalence relation =E inducing a partition of terms into E-equivalence classes on which rewriting computations, denoted ->R/E and called *rewriting modulo E*, are issued. This paper investigates *confluence of ->R/E*, usually called *E-confluence*, for *conditional* rewriting-based systems, where rewriting steps are determined by conditional rules. We rely on Jouannaud and Kirchner's framework to investigate confluence of an abstract relation R modulo an abstract equivalence relation E on a set A. We show how to particularize the framework to be used with conditional systems. Then, we show how to define appropriate finite sets of *conditional pairs* to prove and disprove E-confluence. In particular, we introduce *Logic-based Conditional Critical Pairs* which do not require the use of (often infinitely many) E-unifiers to provide a finite representation of the *local peaks* considered in the abstract framework. We also introduce *parametric Conditional Variable Pairs* which are essential to deal with conditional rules in the analysis of E-confluence. Our results apply to well-known classes of rewriting-based systems. In particular, to *Equational (Conditional) Term Rewriting Systems*.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01847v2
What is a monoid?,"In many situations one encounters a notion that resembles that of a monoid. It consists of a carrier and two operations that resemble a unit and a multiplication, subject to three equations that resemble associativity and left and right unital laws. The question then arises whether this notion in fact that of a monoid in a suitable sense. Category theorists have answered this question by providing a notion of monoid in a monoidal category, or more generally in a multicategory. While this encompasses many examples, it is unsuitable in other cases, such as the notion of relative monad, and the modelling of call-by-push-value sequencing. In each of these examples, the leftmost and/or the rightmost factor of a multiplication or associativity law seems to be distinguished. To include such examples, we generalize the multicategorical framework in two stages. Firstly, we move to the framework of a left-skew multicategory (due to Bourke and Lack), which generalizes both multicategory and left-skew monoidal category. The notion of monoid in this framework encompasses examples where only the leftmost factor is distinguished, such as the notion of relative monad. Secondly, we consider monoids in the novel framework of a bi-skew multicategory. This encompasses examples where both the leftmost and the rightmost factor are distinguished, such as the notion of a category on a span, and the modelling of call-by-push-value sequencing. In the bi-skew framework (which is the most general), we give a coherence result saying that a monoid corresponds to an unbiased monoid, i.e. a map from the unit bi-skew multicategory.",PAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12158v1
