1,CS,"Proteins are the fundamental biological macromolecules which underline practically all biological activities. Protein–protein interactions (PPIs), as they are known, are how proteins interact with other proteins in their environment to perform biological functions. Understanding PPIs reveals how cells behave and operate, such as the antigen recognition and signal transduction in the immune system. In the past decades, many computational methods have been developed to predict PPIs automatically, requiring less time and resources than experimental techniques. In this paper, we present a comparative study of various graph neural networks for protein–protein interaction prediction. Five network models are analyzed and compared, including neural networks (NN), graph convolutional neural networks (GCN), graph attention networks (GAT), hyperbolic neural networks (HNN), and hyperbolic graph convolutions (HGCN). By utilizing the protein sequence information, all of these models can predict the interaction between proteins. Fourteen PPI datasets are extracted and utilized to compare the prediction performance of all these methods. The experimental results show that hyperbolic graph neural networks tend to have a better performance than the other methods on the protein-related datasets."
2,CS,"CompCert is the first commercially available optimizing compiler that is formally verified, using machine-assisted mathematical proofs, to be exempt from mis-compilation. The executable code it produces is proved to behave exactly as specified by the semantics of the source C program. This article gives an overview of the design of CompCert and its proof concept and then focuses on aspects relevant for industrial application. We briefly summarize practical experience and give an overview of recent CompCert development aiming at industrial usage. CompCert's intended use is the compilation of life-critical and mission-critical software meeting high levels of assurance. In this context tool qualification is of paramount importance. We summarize the confidence argument of CompCert and give an overview of relevant qualification strategies."
3,CS,"Virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) are expected to revolutionise entertainment, healthcare, communication and the manufacturing industries among many others. Near-eye displays are an enabling vessel for VR/AR applications, which have to tackle many challenges related to ergonomics, comfort, visual quality and natural interaction. These challenges are related to the core elements of these near-eye display hardware and tracking technologies. In this state-of-the-art report, we investigate the background theory of perception and vision as well as the latest advancements in display engineering and tracking technologies. We begin our discussion by describing the basics of light and image formation. Later, we recount principles of visual perception by relating to the human visual system. We provide two structured overviews on state-of-the-art near-eye display and tracking technologies involved in such near-eye displays. We conclude by outlining unresolved research questions to inspire the next generation of researchers."
4,IS,"The implementation of eHealth systems with a trial-and-error approach is very expensive and often unsuccessful. This study aims to examine the constructs and relationships of the modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to determine its applicability in assessing health professionals’ behavioral intention to adopt eHealth systems in resource-limited settings. An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 384 healthcare professionals in referral hospitals of Amhara regional state, Ethiopia. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data, which were analyzed using Epi-info version 7 for entry, SPSS version 25 for descriptive statistics, and AMOS 22 for structural equation modeling (SEM) to validate the relationships between variables. The SEM findings indicate that perceived usefulness significantly influences attitude (β = 0.298, P < 0.01) and intention to use eHealth (β = 0.387, P < 0.01), while perceived ease of use influences perceived usefulness (β = 0.385, P < 0.05), attitude (β = 0.347, P < 0.05), and intention to use eHealth (β = 0.339, P < 0.01). Technical infrastructure significantly affects attitude (β = 0.412, P < 0.01) and intention (β = 0.355, P < 0.01), and IT experience impacts perceived usefulness (β = 0.595, P < 0.01) and attitude (β = 0.267, P < 0.05), though its effect on intention was not significant. Among all constructs, healthcare professionals’ attitude toward eHealth showed the strongest effect on intention to use eHealth systems (β = 0.52, P < 0.01). Overall, the model explains 56.2% of the variance in behavioral intention, indicating that implementers should prioritize improving technical infrastructure, enhancing staff IT skills, and fostering positive attitudes toward eHealth through continuous support."
5,IS,"The evolution of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems has been a highlight in the information systems (IS) literature since early 1990’s. The growth of ERP systems has been enormous; however, the time and cost to implement ERP systems and other critical success factors have undermined its true capabilities. The literature suggests that the organisational culture is often over-looked while implementing ERP systems. Consequently, this research in progress paper is written to address the notion of cultural influences on user satisfaction with ERP implementation. Due to the diverse nature of ERP systems, the author is only concentrating on factors influencing at the post-implementation stage of ERP life cycle in a large Australian University. This interpretive study involves student administration staff as users and applies the theories developed by Hofstede’s work on national culture dimensions to assess the users’ satisfaction and subsequently address the importance of user satisfaction factor as a success measure for ERP implementation."
6,IS,"In any business network for record transactions, validation, and track assets, we have used a Blockchain platform, which is shared a distributed ledger that used cryptography techniques. Globally, there are different rules and operating procedures in the supply chain network. These regulations are used for end-to-end tracking between industries of different countries. The major problem faced today is asset traceability, and it is addressed with the usage of Blockchain technology. Greater asset traceability is provided using this technology. Throughout this research study, we suggest a commodity traceability network focused on blockchain technologies, which permanently stores all commodity history in a global database by way of smart contracts and creates a chain that can trace back to the source of goods. In particular, we built an incident response system to check the parties’ identity and ensure the legitimacy of the transaction. And all events are stored permanently in the form of logs to manage disputes and track accountable entities. Also, a device prototype is designed utilizing truffle research nets. Initially, a user login form is developed to make a part of the Blockchain, followed with a function to add an entry of the stock-keeping unit (SKU) into the Blockchain. The SKU is used for adding the product or item into the Blockchain, i.e., the product information is added like “Dairy Milk”, then one transaction is complete. The local languages like Urdu and Hindi are supported the SKU. All users of the retail network can be accessed the SKU “Id” of that product, and it can update the status of the product. So, the history of the product is saved in the block until the customer block innetwork, and the customer can access it by using the QR scan code. Customer confidence is increased, and customer satisfaction reflects in sales."
7,IT,"In the last decade, novel software architectural patterns, such as microservices, have emerged to improve application modularity and to streamline their development, testing, scaling, and component replacement. To support these new trends, new practices as DevOps methodologies and tools, promoting better cooperation between software development and operations teams, have emerged to support automation and monitoring throughout the whole software construction lifecycle. That affected positively several IT companies, but also helped the transition to the softwarization of complex telco infrastructures in the last years. Container-based technologies played a crucial role by enabling microservice fast deployment and their scalability at low overhead; however, modern container-based applications may easily consist of hundreds of microservices services with complex interdependencies and call for advanced orchestration capabilities. While there are several emerging container orchestration engines, such as Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Apache Mesos, and Cattle, a thorough functional and performance assessment to help IT managers in the selection of the most appropriate orchestration solution is still missing. This paper aims to fill that gap. Collected experimental results show that Kubernetes outperforms its counterparts for very complex application deployments, while other engines can be a better choice for simpler deployments."
8,IT,"The latest wireless technology is developing smart phone technology and growing mobile cloud technology. Mobile cloud computing has a lot of potential benefits in the future, but it is also easy for hackers to gain complete control of many other users. Data privacy is crucial. While data security is designed to be secure, the most significant disadvantage for consumers is that once the computer is connected to the internet, an intruder can quickly steal data from the targeted target. To improve security, a hybrid intrusion detection system (HyInt) and honeypot networks have been added into the Mobile Cloud Environment, with the primary purpose of mitigating both unknown and known attacks.The study’s execution offers a unique perspective on the algorithm’s security and quality products that was not covered in previous studies. The research included extensive statistical analysis to demonstrate the consistency of the proposed algorithm. The implementation and evaluation findings demonstrate that there is lots of potential for further research in the cloud-based Intrusion Detection System. The developed technique can be used to effectively monitor network traffic in a high-security cloud environment designed for military and banking reasons."
9,IT,"In the emerging environment of high performance IP networks, it is expected that local and campus area backbones, enterprise networks, and internet service providers (ISPs) will use multigigabit and terabit networking technologies where IP routers will be used not only to interconnect backbone segments but also to act as points of attachments to high performance wide area links. Special attention must be given to new powerful architectures for routers in order to play that demanding role. In this paper, we identify important trends in router design and outline some design issues facing the next generation of routers. It is also observed that the achievement of high throughput IP routers is possible if the critical tasks are identified and special purpose modules are properly tailored to perform them."
