1,CS,"Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Bard, have revolutionized natural language understanding and generation. They possess deep language comprehension, human-like text generation capabilities, contextual awareness, and robust problem-solving skills, making them invaluable in various domains (e.g., search engines, customer support, translation). In the meantime, LLMs have also gained traction in the security community, revealing security vulnerabilities and showcasing their potential in security-related tasks. This paper explores the intersection of LLMs with security and privacy. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs positively impact security and privacy, potential risks and threats associated with their use, and inherent vulnerabilities within LLMs. Through a comprehensive literature review, the paper categorizes the papers into “The Good” (beneficial LLM applications), “The Bad” (offensive applications), and “The Ugly” (vulnerabilities of LLMs and their defenses). We have some interesting findings. For example, LLMs have proven to enhance code security (code vulnerability detection) and data privacy (data confidentiality protection), outperforming traditional methods. However, they can also be harnessed for various attacks (particularly user-level attacks) due to their human-like reasoning abilities. We have identified areas that require further research efforts. For example, Research on model and parameter extraction attacks is limited and often theoretical, hindered by LLM parameter scale and confidentiality. Safe instruction tuning, a recent development, requires more exploration. We hope that our work can shed light on the LLMs’ potential to both bolster and jeopardize cybersecurity."
2,CS,"Despite the success of deep learning in close-set 3D object detection, existing approaches struggle with zero-shot generalization to novel objects and camera configurations. We introduce DetAny3D, a promptable 3D detection foundation model capable of detecting any novel object under arbitrary camera configurations using only monocular inputs. Training a foundation model for 3D detection is fundamentally constrained by the limited availability of annotated 3D data, which motivates DetAny3D to leverage the rich prior knowledge embedded in extensively pre-trained 2D foundation models to compensate for this scarcity. To effectively transfer 2D knowledge to 3D, DetAny3D incorporates two core modules: the 2D Aggregator, which aligns features from different 2D foundation models, and the 3D Interpreter with Zero-Embedding Mapping, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting in 2D-to-3D knowledge transfer. Experimental results validate the strong generalization of our DetAny3D, which not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on unseen categories and novel camera configurations, but also surpasses most competitors on in-domain data. DetAny3D sheds light on the potential of the 3D foundation model for diverse applications in real-world scenarios, e.g., rare object detection in autonomous driving, and demonstrates promise for further exploration of 3D-centric tasks in open-world settings. More visualization results can be found at DetAny3D project page."
3,CS,"Data analysis plays an indispensable role for understanding various phenomena. Cluster analysis, primitive exploration with little or no prior knowledge, consists of research developed across a wide variety of communities. The diversity, on one hand, equips us with many tools. On the other hand, the profusion of options causes confusion. We survey clustering algorithms for data sets appearing in statistics, computer science, and machine learning, and illustrate their applications in some benchmark data sets, the traveling salesman problem, and bioinformatics, a new field attracting intensive efforts. Several tightly related topics, proximity measure, and cluster validation, are also discussed."
4,CS,"The goal of user experience design in industry is to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty through the utility, ease of use, and pleasure provided in the interaction with a product. So far, user experience studies have mostly focused on short-term evaluations and consequently on aspects relating to the initial adoption of new product designs. Nevertheless, the relationship between the user and the product evolves over long periods of time and the relevance of prolonged use for market success has been recently highlighted. In this paper, we argue for the cost-effective elicitation of longitudinal user experience data. We propose a method called the “UX Curve” which aims at assisting users in retrospectively reporting how and why their experience with a product has changed over time. The usefulness of the UX Curve method was assessed in a qualitative study with 20 mobile phone users. In particular, we investigated how users’ specific memories of their experiences with their mobile phones guide their behavior and their willingness to recommend the product to others. The results suggest that the UX Curve method enables users and researchers to determine the quality of long-term user experience and the influences that improve user experience over time or cause it to deteriorate. The method provided rich qualitative data and we found that an improving trend of perceived attractiveness of mobile phones was related to user satisfaction and willingness to recommend their phone to friends. This highlights that sustaining perceived attractiveness can be a differentiating factor in the user acceptance of personal interactive products such as mobile phones. The study suggests that the proposed method can be used as a straightforward tool for understanding the reasons why user experience improves or worsens in long-term product use and how these reasons relate to customer loyalty."
5,CS,"Elliptic curve cryptosystems are considered an efficient alternative to conventional systems such as DSA and RSA. Recently, Montgomery and Edwards elliptic curves have been used to implement cryptosystems. In particular, the elliptic curves Curve25519 and Curve448 were used for instantiating Diffie-Hellman protocols named X25519 and X448. Mapping these curves to twisted Edwards curves allowed deriving two new signature instances, called Ed25519 and Ed448, of the Edwards Digital Signature Algorithm. In this work, we focus on the secure and efficient software implementation of these algorithms using SIMD parallel processing. We present software techniques that target the Intel AVX2 vector instruction set for accelerating prime field arithmetic and elliptic curve operations. Our contributions result in a high-performance software library for AVX2-ready processors. For example, our library computes digital signatures 19% (for Ed25519) and 29% (for Ed448) faster than previous optimized implementations. Also, our library improves by 10% and 20% the execution time of X25519 and X448, respectively."
6,IS,"Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems provide extensive benefits and facilities to the whole enterprise. ERP systems help the enterprise to share and transfer data and information across all functions units inside and outside the enterprise. Sharing data and information between enterprise departments helps in many aspects and aims to achieve different objectives. Cloud computing is a computing model which takes place over the internet and provides scalability, reliability, availability and low cost of computer reassures. Implementing and running ERP systems over the cloud offers great advantages and benefits, in spite of its many difficulties and challenges. In this paper, we follow the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) research method to explore the benefits and challenges of implementing ERP systems over a cloud environment. "
7,IS,"This research makes an attempt to understand various factors that influence the adoption of mobile applications. Within the context of the “Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology” (UTAUT) modified model, considering the upcoming demand and increase in demand for mobile-banking applications, the researcher tried to explore the theoretical concept between random people of various states in India. The primary data was collected by preparing a questionnaire and circulating it using Google Forms. The collected data was further coded into Smart PLS 4 to understand the model and structural equation with reference to mobile-banking technological adoption and factors that had a significant impact. The conclusions derived from the study is that social influence, “effort expectancy”, and “trust” factors had a very strong influence on the “purchase intention”, whereas “effort” and “risk” factors had a negligible impact on purchase intent. It was also found that the UTAUT model is appropriate for evaluating the technological adoption of mobile-banking applications. With the advent of many players in the market and their unique banking management applications on mobile platforms, consumers are moving towards different third-party app than their origin bank in which they hold account. This has forced banking institutions to up the pace in the competition, introducing a lot of new features. It is also important to understand that, as a customer, there are a lot of attributes that he would be looking into for adoption. This paper is an attempt to understand the advancements in various variables that consumers would look at in the area of mobile-banking applications."
8,IS,"Electronic learning (e-learning) has been widely used as a complement subject to traditional learning methods. Implementing e-learning is becoming one of many solutions in effecting the study process offered by higher educational institutions, such as Universitas Pembangunan Nasional “Veteran” Jakarta = UPNVJ and Sekolah Tinggi Teknologi Telematika Telkom (ST3 Telkom) Purwokerto, Central Java. The objective of this research is to measure the e-learning system success implemented by UPNVJ and ST3 Telkom Purwokerto and then compare the similarities and differences between of two. The modified DeLone & McLean Information Systems Success Model and part of Technology Acceptance Model are adopted in this study. The respondents are students who have been experience in using e-learning and are selected randomly from the Faculty of Computer Science of UPNVJ and from ST3 Telkom Purwokerto. The total respondents are 387, which consist of 215 students from UPNVJ and 172 from ST3 Telkom Purwokerto. For the results at UPNVJ, there are two hypotheses that were proven insignificant and at ST3 Telkom there are three hypotheses that were proven insignificant. Findings at UPNVJ show that the e-learning benefit can be explained by its independent variables by 53.8%%, and at ST3 Telkom by 60.6%. These percentages show that the predictors explained 53.8% for UPNVJ's e-learning benefit and 60.6% e-learning benefit for ST3 Telkom Purwokerto. These findings could be considered as novelties, because they are different from the original model."
9,IS,"The success rate of enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementations is not high, despite the significant investments made by organizations in these applications. It has often been suggested that a combination of inadequate preparedness and inappropriate project management is responsible for this low success rate. This paper presents a case study of a successful ERP implementation, specifically examining the rollout in the Irish subsidiary of a UK multinational. The study investigates the applicability of the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) framework to ERP projects. By discussing each PMBOK category, the case illustrates where the framework aligns well and where it may require adaptation for ERP contexts. The findings suggest that while PMBOK is broadly useful, ERP projects have specific demands that necessitate a shift in emphasis within certain categories. The case also provides insights into how organizations evaluate the success of complex change initiatives. The research highlights the importance of context-specific project management strategies and emphasizes the value of understanding organizational nuances when planning ERP rollouts. The authors conclude with suggestions for future research involving additional ERP case studies in diverse industries and organizational settings."
10,IS,"Mobile-based advisory services have significant benefits, including access to agricultural information, knowledge sharing, meteorological information, marketing-related information, and financial services for smallholder farmers. This study aimed to assess farmers’ information behavior regarding mobile-based advisory services and how farmers with different characteristics and attitudes access and adopt information. Data were collected from 382 farmers in Dakhalia governorate, Egypt. The most frequently received information was related to best agricultural practices, weather forecasts, seed varieties and treatment, and water management. Cluster analysis revealed that 47% of the farmers had low information behavior. Seventy-one of the respondents had a favorable attitude toward information retrieval from mobile agricultural services. The information behavior groups of the farmers significantly differed in education, farm size, diversity of agricultural production, and attitude regarding trust and quality of the information provided. Information behavior among farmers has useful implications for policymakers in supporting the long-term benefits of mobile-based advisory services."
11,IT,"This article describes an approach for providing dynamic quality of service (QoS) support in a variable bandwidth network, which may include wireless links and mobile nodes. The dynamic QoS approach centers on the notion of providing QoS support at some point within a range requested by applications. To utilize dynamic QoS, applications must be capable of adapting to the level of QoS provided by the network, which may vary during the course of a connection. To demonstrate and evaluate the dynamic QoS concept, we have implemented a new protocol called dynamic resource reservation protocol (dRSVP) and a new QoS application program interface (API). The paper describes this new protocol and API and also discusses our experience with adaptive streaming video and audio applications that work with the new protocol in a testbed network, including wireless local area network connectivity and wireless link connectivity emulated over the wired Ethernet. Qualitative and quantitative assessments of the dynamic RSVP protocol are provided."
12,IT,"This paper presents a novel monitoring architecture addressed to the cloud provider and the cloud consumers. This architecture offers a monitoring platform-as-a-Service to each cloud consumer that allows to customize the monitoring metrics. The cloud provider sees a complete overview of the infrastructure whereas the cloud consumer sees automatically her cloud resources and can define other resources or services to be monitored. This is accomplished by means of an adaptive distributed monitoring architecture automatically deployed in the cloud infrastructure. This architecture has been implemented and released under GPL license to the community as “MonPaaS”, open source software for integrating Nagios and OpenStack. An intensive empirical evaluation of performance and scalability have been done using a real deployment of a cloud computing infrastructure in which more than 3,700 VMs have been executed."
13,IT,"Proper configuration of security technologies is critical to balance the needs for access and protection of information. The common practice of using a layered security architecture that has multiple technologies amplifies the need for proper configuration because the configuration decision about one security technology has ramifications for the configuration decisions about others. Furthermore, security technologies rely on each other for their operations, thereby affecting each other's contribution. In this paper we study configuration of and interaction between a firewall and intrusion detection systems (IDS). We show that deploying a technology, whether it is the firewall or the IDS, could hurt the firm if the configuration is not optimized for the firm's environment. A more serious consequence of deploying the two technologies with suboptimal configurations is that even if the firm could benefit when each is deployed alone, the firm could be hurt by deploying both. Configuring the IDS and the firewall optimally eliminates the conflict between them, ensuring that if the firm benefits from deploying each of these technologies when deployed alone, it will always benefit from deploying both. When optimally configured, we find that these technologies complement or substitute each other. Furthermore, we find that while the optimal configuration of an IDS does not change whether it is deployed alone or together with a firewall, the optimal configuration of a firewall has a lower detection rate (i.e., allowing more access) when it is deployed with an IDS than when deployed alone. Our results highlight the complex interactions between firewall and IDS technologies when they are used together in a security architecture, and, hence, the need for proper configuration to benefit from these technologies."
14,IT,"Cloud has become a dominant technology in todays information technology environment and the need arises to abide with the growing demand of clients. The pressure on information technology organizations is constantly increasing to deploy the customer's application over private cloud. This change has come into light since a large number of clients have directly started to contact the cloud venders for this support. Moreover, the DevOps teams are in much bigger focus now since they are responsible for the automation and provisioning of the whole environment along with the client application. This paper focuses upon the automation of customer application right from environment provisioning to application deployment. In this paper the whole architecture of automated application deployment assembled using amazon as IAAS provider and Ansible as the orchestration engine."
15,IT,"Current approaches to access control on the Web servers do not scale to enterprise-wide systems because they are mostly based on individual user identities. Hence we were motivated by the need to manage and enforce the strong and efficient RBAC access control technology in large-scale Web environments. To satisfy this requirement, we identify two different architectures for RBAC on the Web, called user-pull and server-pull. To demonstrate feasibility, we implement each architecture by integrating and extending well-known technologies such as cookies, X.509, SSL, and LDAP, providing compatibility with current web technologies. We describe the technologies we use to implement RBAC on the Web in different architectures. Based on our experience, we also compare the tradeoffs of the different approaches."
