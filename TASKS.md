# üìù NLP Project Task Breakdown ‚Äì Updated (Final Models Complete)

This markdown file tracks the step-by-step progress of the NLP classification project. Each task is designed to be small, focused, and Git-commit-worthy.

---

## üöÄ Project Initialization
- [x] Initialize GitHub repo

---

## ‚ú® Text Preprocessing
- [x] Load dataset into pandas
- [x] Clean text: lowercase, remove punctuation/numbers
- [x] Remove stopwords using NLTK
- [x] Lemmatize using spaCy (optional stage)

---

## üåü Feature Extraction
- [x] Vectorize text using TF-IDF (ngram_range = (1,2), min_df = 2, max_df = 0.95)

---

## üìö Methodology Classification
- [x] Define methodology labels (QLT, QNT, M)
- [x] Train Logistic Regression baseline (v1.0)
- [x] Upgrade to SVM + SMOTE + Bigram TF-IDF (v1.2)

---

## üìä Final Cross-Validation & Reporting
- [x] Implement 5-fold cross-validation for all finalized models (v1.1, v1.2, v2.0)
- [x] Log fold-wise scores, mean accuracy, and standard deviation per classifier
- [x] Create version comparison table (Previous vs Final accuracy and variance)
- [x] Add consolidated fold-wise table across all classifiers
- [x] Write final summary + interpretation + architecture justification in Notion
- [x] Update `README.md` and `TASKS.md` to reflect final experimental validation

---

## ‚úÖ Current Status: All Pipelines Finalized and Validated ‚Äì May 3, 2025

- All classification tasks completed with final architecture: `SVM + SMOTE + Bigram TF-IDF`.
- v2.0 Methodology classifier using Title + Abstract achieves best QLT performance.
- All models and vectorizers versioned, saved, and documented.
- Results aligned across Jupyter, GitHub, and Notion.

**System is ready for:**
- Transformer-based experimentation (e.g. SciBERT)
- Dataset expansion
- Optional API deployment or research publication
