    "- **Standard deviation:** 10.69%\n",

    "The Methodology classification model achieved an average accuracy of **61.9%** across 5 folds.  \n",
    "The standard deviation of accuracies was **0.0738**, indicating moderate variance across different folds.  \n",
    "The performance is lower compared to Discipline classification, which is expected due to the higher difficulty of distinguishing research methodologies from abstracts.  \n",
    "The model demonstrates reasonable generalization given the dataset size and task complexity."
